Dear Spotify why do I get songs that I didn't put on my playlist??? And why do we have shuffle play?,negative
The player controls sometimes disappear for no reason. App restart forgets what I was playing but fixes the issue.,neutral
I love the selection and the lyrics are provided with the song you're listening to!,positive
"Still extremely slow when changing storage to external sd card.. I'm convinced this is done on purpose, spotify knows of this issue and has done NOTHING to solve it! Over time I have changed sd cards, each being faster in read, write speeds(all samsung brand). And please add ""don't like song"" so it will never appear again in my searches or playlists.",neutral
"It's a great app and the best mp3 music app I have ever used but there is one problem that, why can't we play some songs or find some songs? despite this the app is wonderful I recommend it. it's just the best.",positive
"I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline.",negative
"Love Spotify, and usually this app is the best, but as others have stated; the control buttons disappear and podcasts stop for no reason, which is only fixed by deleting and reinstalling the app. First world problems for sure, but highly annoying nonetheless, especially when paying for prime.",negative
Can't play Spotify when on WiFi,negative
"I had amazon premium music family package and it was good. Everyone could listen to whatever they liked on their respective alexas in their rooms by just asking to play, no problem. We now have spotify premium family and the alexa integration is poor. It just doesn't like spotify. It just stops playing all of the time , you can't play on different alexa devices at the same time just by asking. Why isn't the integration better?",negative
Worst app always says I'm offline and never showed any song or podcast,negative
i hav any music that i like it is super🙌,positive

"I logged out on my acc but when I tried to open it to log in, it won't open.. all I see is the logo",neutral
"usually I love the app, but I'm having the same problems everyone else is reporting. Random pauses, stops playing and doesn't restart, and currently I can't view the song or podcast I'm currently playing so I can't pause or skip back and forth. It's fairly unusable at this stage which isn't acceptable for a paid service.",negative
An amazing music experience,positive
Like that is has Everything I like to listen to. And with no commercial even better. Even the more like this are songs I've been wanting and not knowing the name brought some out! Thanks Spotify!,positive

The best music app ever I have seen,positive
"WOW!! ....all of a sudden my login doesn't work. Even though I'm 100% positive it is correct. This morning my app asks me to login? Why? This hasn't happened before, so obviously you are having some problems. Just found an email in my account telling me to change my password because of 'suspicious behaviour'.... yeah because logging into Spotify on my Xbox is suspicious!? Thanks for the stress this morning, didn't need that. I won't be renewing....my way of teaching you a lesson.",negative

"No commercials, and no adds no need for wifi it can use the satellite radio station to pick up or at least that's how it looks",positive
Wide range of songs collection,positive
"What's the deal here? Compared to the desktop version, this is inferior to it! Why is the ability to play any songs so bare or if not, barely free? Is there more that need to be said about this? I think I made my point clear enough!",negative
Spotify is awesome! I love having any obscure artist I can think of at my fingertips as well as easy access to newer things! UPDATE: Lost a star for constantly asking for a review I've already done.,positive

Pretty good apps for better quality musics,positive
the videoke feature doesn't show in my device until now,positive
love most of the features in the app but one thing is a bit expensive at each month subcription for $9.90,positive
Podcasts becoming a nightmare. Trying to get rid of podcasts on this app is ridiculous. Stupid things are all over the home page. You can click not interested till you're blue in the face and I'll just keep throwing up more spam casts.,negative
Best birthday present I have ever received from my baby brother! I listen to something at least everyday. So happy of the selection of Christian artists and music. Love finding new artists. Let just listening to great podcasts. Thank you so much for such a wonderful app!,positive
The only downside is they rotate songs in and out so one month you can listen to that great song next month maybe not.,positive
The sound quality is really good and I can listen to my favourite songs anytime and anywhere without any disturbance. That's really good experience 👍 I loved this app alot. Keep providing us the best service 👍👍,positive
Keeps cutting out and not showing what song is playing,negative
Very unuser friendly as compared to ipad and pc,negative
As a paying customer there is nothing I can say about Spotify. It is perfecto.,positive
So much adds like I get 6 adds before I start a song and you need premium just play a song itself.,negative
"Exceptional application for online songs. I loved the option of merging the app with inter music player of samsung. Overall, application works flows less.",positive
Spotify is better than joox fosho,positive
"Since Disney started to pay for ads for Disney+, the non-premium version of Spotify became useless because after 1 or 2 songs you get at least 2 ads, one or two from Disney+ and sometimes one more. I will change my review if I won't get so many ads.",negative
Why dose the go from playing liked songs to songs that you haven't even looked at that's what it's getting three stars,neutral

"It was good at first, but it wouldnt let me pick a song and it had forced me to listen to an entire playlist to get to my fav song because they limited it to 6 skips per hour, why are you limiting skiping songs?",negative
"I love it soo much and I will rate it a 4 star, the problem is that there are constant ads, and the singing option near the lyrics doesn't seem to appear for me anymore",positive

Too much and too long ads.,neutral
"I didn't really like the app. Whenever I play a song, it just plays a different one.",negative
"Had no issues with this app for years being a premium user but now really struggling with it. As someone else said before, there is now no player so can't skip, pause etc. Not sure if this is because I'm on a Samsung Galaxy? As it does come back briefly if I restart my phone 🤷‍♀️",negative
"Great song selection, amazing audio quality. However I have problems everyday with casting to Google home, connection issues, and I lose control of the volume. I need to open the app to be able to change the volume which is an inconvenience. I also think there should be an option to 'shuffle all songs' rather than having to put them all Into a playlist, or 'like' every single song which is very time consuming. Making playlists could be easier too, selecting multiple albums at once for example.",neutral
"Just bring back the ""shuffle all"" albums option. 🤦🏾‍♂️",positive
Quality sound and selection. But they're adds are louder than the music sometimes.,positive
It always stuck at black screen,negative
Great music quality,positive

I will give less than one star the app plays too many adds after each and every song As I have not purchased premium this gives too many adds which irritate a lot in your mood.,negative
Awesome but some songs I can't find,positive
"I really like Spotify, I don't have proplem with ads but shuffle and only 6 skips per hour is sooooo annoying! I neither want to pay for Spotify premium nor switch to another app, and this makes Spotify really hard to use.",neutral
Work really well with Android Auto on those long drives home.,positive
Please turn off shuffle play!!!,negative
"Its good but when u want to play a song , they give other songs yo listen to instaed of the song and sometimes when u trying to get to the song the skips are limited .It has the same effect on the playlist u cant enjoy ur song without other songs interfering and eepecially adding songs u dont like to ur playlist",neutral
In the middle of songs its pauses and then restarts the whole song. You have to go into the app and play the song again.,positive
"Very glitchy, audio randomly drops out or stops playing. Control bar disappears from the bottom of the screen and unable to pause, stop or skip audio without closing out of the app.",negative

"I love Spotify, I listen more and more, music an podcasts. We have a premium account, it's worth every penny.",positive
"What the hell? I'm having the same issue as ""The Patoto Man"", minus random songs being added. I can't even choose any song at all that I want to play. I can't view them properly, I can't play them directly and it only starts a 10 second snippet of the song. I can't even listen to any music I want, and can't even have playlists play the music I want. And the big one, it all seems to just be a Samsung/ Google Play Store issue. I can play just fine on Apple mobile devices like iPads.",negative
This app is good but fixe it i can't sign in,neutral
"Dude the app is good and all but just today I was using it and later in the day I check it and it won't let me play my playlist, and random songs are added toy playlist I can't even select a song I want to play I can only listen to it for a short period of time, and it says ""you added"" in your playlist and then bottom part says ""we added"" I don't know what to do I just want to listen to the full songs without random bots adding random songs that I don't even like and have any interest.",negative
I love Spotify just wish I can download music,positive
It's awesome and great music app,positive
Works super well.... When it works... The app doesnt seem to want to load 3/4ths of the time. Ultra laggy. Locks up my phone occationally... Makes no sense. Otherwise. Features are plentiful and you can find most anything.,negative
I can't even listen to my favorite songs bc of the shuffle and I tried different accounts and it doesn't even change even a little,negative
it does'nt let you choose your songs,negative
The load time is wonderful and very short and you don't have to wait long to hear the next best thing.,positive
"I love listening to music (I use it as a coping mechanism), so I love Spotify so much too. But, about 3 days ago (?), my Spotify wouldn't load, it would just stay on the spotify logo screen thing. Tried installing it and uninstalling it for 5 times, restarted my phone 2 times, cleared the cache/data for about 8 times, and I still can't open it (also waited for an hour for it to load).",negative
"Used to be good. It dont let me play my playlists, pause, stop, start and go back a track from my phone (samsung). I emailed spotify and asked help from a member but nothings working.",negative
"For an app that has been available for 8 years, the amount of issues I have is frustrating. Like some other say, it stops playing randomly while in the background, even though I allow background data use and all that. At times while running in the background, the app dissappears from my toolbar and I have to open it independently, then I have no way to click on what is playing at the bottom so I must force close it.",negative
I really enjoy My Music life Nice App Thanks for Spotify,positive
i cant open the app. it's been 2 days please fix this.,negative
It's not that bad but why can't i just directly play the song i pressed on?,neutral
Love spotify great for all the family,positive
"This app worked well until v8.6.98.900, when trying to install newer versions of the app, my pioneer car system wouldn't work with spotify anymore. This means that I have to upgrade all my apps manually to be able to keep the last working version of their app. Hope spotify will fix their broken app soon.",negative
"I use to love this app, but I soon hated it because it keeps on playing music and other songs that isn't on my playlists or my liked songs, I've turned off the option for it to do that ( play similar Songs when your playlists ends. Something like that ) but it doesn't work, I don't recommend.",negative
Excellent music experience,positive
This is an amazing app I use it all the time and it's very affordable. If you are looking for a app to lift your mood Spotify it the one you go for.,positive
Spotify has literally accounted for everything when it comes to your best music experience. It's so easy to use but there's still so many features and I honestly didn't realize how much I needed it until I got it. Would recommend above apple music as it's more aesthetically pleasing and has way better features. GET SPOTIFY!!! (I do have premium) but even with ads it's still good.,positive
Sometimes it is not working,negative
Very annoying and disturbing,negative
Good audio play experience with spotify.,positive
The best music app till now ...,positive
I hate ads and they do send work 1 month free premium (super upp),positive
I have gotten 10 ads in a row trying to listen to a single song. The ads were longer then the sond,negative

"App stuck on loading black screen with Spotify logo, restarted, reinstalled, no luck! Using Note 20 ultra",negative
"2022.07.08 Would like to be able to save queue as playlist. Would like to be able to scroll back in queue an arbitrary number of titles. When playlist is playing, be able to add songs to queue, rearrange playlist sequence, and ""save changes to playlist?"" prompt at end of playlist... 🤷‍♂️",positive
"Worst app for music,so many ads.",negative
Best song app all over,positive
"I love 💓 this app . It has ads but not that level, that's the reason. And you can choose your favorite artist. You can enjoy different Playlist in just 28 mb. And resso use 68 mb. So I prefer Spotify.",positive
Nice music quality,positive
Umm... Lately There is Auto Pausing Problem when the screen Locks Hope It Will Fix Soon,positive
Amazing songs and artists!!! Great app 10/10 review!!,positive
"Not bad but not good. I wanted to listen to a song that I like but suddenly it played a different song. I tried adding my fav songs to my playlist but it played a song that I did not add on my playlist. Well, that's okay.",negative
"I absolutely love Spotify and I'm obsessed with music, but I only rated it 4 starts for a reasom. Ok so basically my Spotify was doing this weird thing it like had only one song in all my playlist and literally nothing would play, and I had no idea how to fix. And whats weird is that it would work on my other devices with my Spotify account just not on my phone. So it might be my phone but idk. And another thing it does is it just randomly kicks me out of the app sometimes. Well thats all I have",positive
I really love it my favorite thing about this app is the lyrics 😍 it's amazing I love singing along with my favorite songs 🎵 💕,positive
Best music app....best collections.....they wil create playlists specially for youu...I loved it best app ever,positive
Nice app but the ads is very disturbing,positive
Stopped working this morning for some reason.,negative
How long will it take to fix the payment option. Being on the free plan is not a nice experience. I want to get back on Premium but its failed now for the 2nd month.,negative
This is nice app i love spotify,positive
Having streaming trouble with new update. Skipping of audio and app crashes,neutral
"Easy play, and all singers and songs I wanted is here.Thank you",positive
It's a amazing app but if it has been an option to download songs it's completely fantasy,positive
The recommendations are always for popular stuff no matter what you listen to. Worst recommendations of all time. There is little to no effort put into these. If you made a playlist exclusively with 90's Norwegian death metal this dumb app would trip over it's dick racing to suggest Island in the Sun by Weezer. The now playing bar only exists most of the time making it almost impossible to use without restarting your phone,negative
Best music app but spotify should include the dolby atmos and spatial audios,positive
I'm speechless this app is amazing.,positive
I cant open the app 😭 I've tried deleting it and restarting my phone someone help,negative
For a pricey monthly fee the app should work the way it's expected to.. but unfortunately it no longer does... Constantly pausing when you don't want it to no pause button visible when you do want to pause no currently playing information screen So no way to skip forward back etc... And when the currently playing screen is available (often have to uninstall reinstall) still does not rotate to landscape mode ... Been waiting for this basic feature for literally years,negative
"I have used this app for a few years now, Love it so much.",positive
NICE ONE THANKS FOR YOUR HELP AND support,positive
Have same issue as others... App keeps freezing and crashing. Is there something with the recent updates as the app plays and stops constantly?,negative
This is one of the best music app of all time it's amazing if I could do 3000 out of 100000 I would give it a 100000000000000,positive

All good but I don't like ads too much ads,positive
"Living remotely, Spotify is the only way to go. Love it.!!!",positive
"It’s the best App I have ever used for listening music. There are numerous options, playlists and specially blends.Spotify really knows me well. It creates playlists by my favourite songs which is appreciated. Artist mix,genre mix,mood mix these are so good. I like using Spotify. But I wish there were a few more advantages for those who use a free account. For example skipping more than 6 songs.",positive
So bad I just want my songs so when I made a new play list to get rid of all the songs they added it literally put 500 extra song I rate one or zero,negative
The app is not working on moto g52 5g. The app opens and nothing happens it will be in opening app state only.,negative
Probably the best app I found in Play Store for music.I love every feature in this app and my opinion is that you must add calller tone and ringtone option in Spotify because Spotify have all songs and other apps don't so if you add this feature for paid listeners I'll be amazing.,positive
"A lot of ads come in this, after every two songs the add comes, please remove the add.",negative
Love it but why did they add it where if I play the song on my tv they show a picture of the artist's profile picture as the background? I liked the solid color with the album cover in the corner better. I couldn't find a way to turn it off either. Love Mac DeMarco but it jumpscared me seeing his face out of nowhere. Need an option to take it off. Ruins the aesthetic.,positive
"This is absolutely ridiculous. I lost all my music, ended that subscription and account, made a whole new one with a new subscription and can't like songs, can't add podcasts or playlists. Severely unimpressed",negative
I can find most songs I love but sometimes can't find older songs but love it none the less.,positive
It is a great music app it's my favorite and I know you will like it but one thing I don't like is you have limited amount of skips eatch hour and I recommend getting the app it's great to listening to songs with your friends and you :) and I love how you can make playlists I have one with over 50 songs!,positive
"Love it. Sadly you have to buy a subscription to fully enjoy the service. Love the blended mix between songs. Was told sound would be better when bought a subscription, but it's still the same.",positive
"It's a good application. When I'm searching for peace by listening song I can find it here.but I think it needs some improvements.. such as shuffle on off, playlist change,and many more.",neutral
"I like this app because of the wide variety of music, but a flaw to this app is the amount of ads during and after the music or podcast you listened to, and the 5 skips per hour. Other than that this is a good app.",positive
"Best music app very good quality songs, they sometimes give 30mins without interruption, there are hundreds of not thousands of songs which are in high quality I really recommend downloading",positive
Easy to opporate and the pmaylist it matches up foe me r spot in what i wanted to hear. 👍👍,positive

On time and always on point,positive
Great music. Easy to use. Amazing selection variety!,positive
"Slowly getting worse, my Spotify has been getting super buggy. A lot of random pauses and disconnects with my Tacoma. Bugged so bad it started playing music without knowing it and I could not pause or pull up any screen that would allow me to pause the music. Had to restart my phone, a S10+.",negative
Like this app forever but the ads are disturbing 😐 pls take the ads if anyone not have any money what he will do he can't pay any premium so do like that everyone is there nowadays so pls make my demand and Spotify 4ever,positive
Works well for the most part. Hangs occasionally with just a few bugs.,positive
"I have been using the app for podcasts, and I am enjoying it. However, some sometimes the media player does not appear when one transitions to a different podcast channel. To rectify this, I have to relaunch the app. Please see to this problem.",positive

"It works for a little then after a while it doesn't. When pressing the play button for a song a whole different song plays something I've never heard before, or pressed on but it shows the song I've requested playing please fix this.",negative

Songs are again play after complete and need to give next track manual,neutral

There's so many loading issues that have been going on for months, even when you're offline but have downloaded music, it loads very slow or doesn't at all. Extremely annoying when you pay for your plan and it doesn't even function correctly. Please fix the bugs!!!!",neutral
Worst Everytime I open it I can't play any song It says no internet connection even when I am connected to internet. It only works when my phone is connected to WiFi. That's not good at all,negative
They purposely throttle the app making it unbearable and a waste of time to use unless you have premium. Genuine disgusting business practice.,negative
"I love this app but I wish we could have the option to turn off the ""we added"" part of MY playlist I'm don't want to listen to some random German song I can't understand when I'm trying to cry myself to sleep with really sad songs.",positive

U can only see the playlists u've downloaded or partially downloaded. 2.The only way to clear space is to either delete all of ur songs or go playlist by playlist. If a song is on multiple playlists it won't delete. 3.You can't delete individual songs. This review is limited to 500 char. so I'm cut short. And offline mode is broken too.

i use this app multiple times daily. this might actually be my most used app. spotify is amazing and has an extremely large collection of music.,positive
I can't see my playlists on the app. It kept saying that i need to add music and podcasts. I tried creating new playlists but it didnt appear on my library. Is this a bug? Please fix this.,negative
"I have a love/hate relationship with this app. I dont mind the ads, its the fact that i cant choose what songs i want to listen to anymore. I only get previews of the songs. I can only get 6 skips per hour. I cant do anything i want. Almosr all the songs i like to listen to are only for premium users. You put so many restrictions on us. Id rather pay for tidal. 2022 UPDATE: switched to youtube music my life is so much better 😻😻",negative
Every time I play a playlist or press shuffle on a playlist. It gives me some random song I haven't heard of before or even want to hear. For example I was playing a star wars playlist and out of nowhere after the first song. It went to someone like drake,neutral
"I love my Spotify because... It has an ""add free"" option It keeps record of the different types of music, artist, and bands (from old to new school) that I like. Spotify makes me daily mixes to check out ,which I love. Plus I get my daily horoscope reading on my way to work. Spotify= 10 ⭐ 🤩",positive
"Its been a week since I've got this problem where I can't open the app, it's just a black screen with the Spotify logo in the middle, please fix it as soon as possible, I really enjoy the app",negative
Select a song and get something else Ask for RHCP and get Limp Bizkit. i can deal with the dozens of ads but itd be nice to get the music you actually choose.,negative
"Updates downloads when I need it most, I work in a manufacturing facility so it is very hard to get connection and I cant having my phone out too much on the floor. Its annoying to have to wait on it working and feel like my job is at risk cause my PRE DOWNLOADED PLAYLISTS need to re-download... SHUFFLE DOESNT WORK. PLAYS SAME 20 SONGS OUT OF A 40 HOUR PLAYLIST! FIX IT PLEASE!",negative
The app isn't optimised for low connection speeds and spotty connections.,negative
"Spotify as a platform is great. But the app for android is slow, glitch filled garbage.",negative
Love the selections do many to choose!!,positive
Thank you...you brought back the young girl in me! Love looking up the old music from the 80s,positive
Very hard to use compared to other platforms,neutral
It just simply is using a different sing to the one I select,negative
I love Spotify. It plays great music on there.,positive
"I like it I still use and all but the ads bro so many ads like I pick a play list and literally over 6 ads go on then when it's say ""enjoy the next 30 minutes without ads"" its liying cuz and ad pops up when it hasn't even been 30 minutes but I like how it's set up and all so ima still use but bro the ads are over board",neutral
Downgrading to one star. Enjoy paying for a thing that doesn't work.,negative
Some songs are disabled tho,positive
I love this app so much. I have been using Spotify for like 4 years and it has rarely posed any problems. I had an issue with swiching what device i was listening on but ir was easilly fixed. Just a suggestion of mine woud to be to like add/make a remote feature or app so if people are listening on like a computer hooked to a tv they can control spotify from a phone easier,positive
"Music and podcasts when I exercise, shower, cook, eat, whenever I want to feel upbeat, focused, or just want to listen to a great interview. Great app.",positive
I can't even open the app anymore I can't listen to music,negative
"Hello, i facing a problem sometimes it turn off suddenly and no pop up when music was on. I have to keep install and uninstall this app, and it kinds annoyed me sometimes. Please fix this bug. I was using samsung a73 G.",negative
Really good but it needs better sound quality,positive
Best app for streaming the latest music hands down. If you have Spotify Duo you & your parter can create your own accounts & playlist for one small price. I absolutely love Spotify. Highly recommended.,positive
"Decent service... Except that the free version is getting to the point that at least as much time listening to music is spent listening to ads! 😵 I get you want people to pay for Premium but it's truly ridiculous. Used to really like Spotify. Now I just turned it on, it played ONE song, and then LITERALLY at least 8 (I lost count) ads ranging from 15-45 seconds EACH. And not even the ""Enjoy your next 30 mins of ad free listening"" message so for all I know it'll be the same after the next song.",negative
"premium user for years. Spotify has always been my fav music & pod app but I'm thinking about switching. Never used to have any issues, 2 yrs ago I switched to iPhone for the first time - still no problems. Switched back to Samsung a few months ago, the app is almost impossible to use. You can almost never see 'now playing' to control your show or music. It randomly pauses your podcast for no reason. & It marks podcasts as played after 1 sec so you can't sort by unplayed. Also a million pop ups.",neutral
"This app disconnects from the internet regularly for no reason. Can't set daughter's lullabies to ignore so guess what my most played songs and recommendations are? This app isn't cheap, I expect it to be far better.",negative
There is no search option for song.,negative
Best pod cast and music,positive
It will open but I'm stuck at the sign in it won't do anything except show the logo,negative
"Best option for music. Everything you can think of is on Spotify. They give you recommendations, make mixes and give concert info.",positive
"Music and podcasts keep pausing for no reason. Also the playbar for whatever is playing (when it does decide to play) is mysteriously absent from the bottom of the app UI, and also absent from the pull down notification bar on my phone.",negative
The quantity of different types of music is fantastic although they quality can be poor at times,positive
I am very impressed that when many of us requested the play selection feature be reinstated it actually was. I would provide a five-star rating but no one is perfect.,positive
This is the best music app ever. This is the one to rule them all. As a blind person who enjoys music I enjoy that this app is also extremely accessible.,positive
Spotify is great! I love the idea of following up great music and podcasts.,positive
I really like this app. But it's been acting up lately,positive
The app won't show the playlist I want to listen too whether that's a podcast or not the app says there is nothing in it or it will continually loud for hours never ending. Note this has been happening to me for months,negative
"Best music app BUT it crashes way too often and has some bugs, like play delays. Even on a brand new device with 8GB RAM. Please try optimize this.",positive
"I have trouble because I consider it a challenge to navigate without the ""help"" site! Otherwise I enjoy it !",positive
"Too many ads. It says ad free for 30 min, but the ads continue after 3 songs.",negative
"Since the last update, my Spotify has been pausing frequently. It's very frustrating and makes my subscription a waste of money. Please fix it.",negative
Best app I just love the app really very nice app 😊😊 seriously love it,positive
The best music selection and it's very easy to use,positive
Apple music is worse. But better.,negative
"I love having MY music at my fingertips! I don't like when Spotify decides to add music to my playlists though. I know you can turn that feature off but it does it on its own sometimes. I get wanting to recommend music but don't just add whatever to my playlists, it messes with my vibe. 😉 Other than that this is a great app!! Thank you!",positive
Crashed & support doesn't give a damn. After contacting they gave up because every trouble shoot option they have DOES NO DIFFERENCE.,negative
Their Is so many amazing song an gonras that it so hard to pick 1 but thanks to Spotify I don't have to only pick 1 I can pick 5 and Spotify finds them and gives them to me,positive
I had a best experience with this app but as time goes it doesn't play my playlists anymore,positive
"This app is way to buggy for how big the company is and how long it's existed. Long load times, buttons fail to do anything. Continually having to speak to tech support. Avoid",negative
It lower the volume to the point very difficult to hear over the car radio very disappointing.,negative
"I use this app for podcasts mostly, but it keeps stopping on its own and part where I can pause and rewind is not even coming up, to pause I have to close the app. When it works, it is a good app.",neutral
So many songs there have only been a small handful I can't find or a certain version. Sometimes a song is taken off which sukc cause it was the only on there. Up to 1561 songs and still climbing. Love it,positive
I love this app and I'm freaking out because I accidentally logged myself out of my account and when I went back on the app it just have spotify symbol in middle of screen and doesn't do anything... Ive uninstalledthe app 2 times and still nothing..,neutral
"The app works really well but i hope you change the Romanised lyrics of tamil into original. The Romanised lyrics of tamil has alot spelling mistakes , so hope you change that into original",positive
"adds were never there and It should have stayed that way instead of chasing after sponsors and money they should stick with what they have bc all there doing is losing users. Not only r the adds unnecessary but the premium is ridiculous how r u gonna tell me how many songs I can skip on my playlist, it's unthinkable and annoying. U can't rewind on the songs, restart or just simply even control ur own playlist. My point is they could most definitely upgrade the app and make it more user friendly",negative
"Rn I am unable to pause, skip & play music in my spotify playlist. I usually had that bar that allows you to pause, play & skip to the next song when you minimize the spotify app to have music play in the background but its not there anymore. If I play a song from my playlist the next song in that playlist does not play for some reason. Or if I want to pause a song that is playing I'd have to close the app entirely. I have this problem whether I use my earbuds or not. I've never had this problem",neutral
"Just to listen to a couple of short ads, I get to listen to, what is arguably, the greatest Live Album ever: The Allman Brothers Live at the Fillmore East. It just doesn't get any better.",positive
Please put an option to allow us to exit out of the playlist when we are not listening to music. Its extremely frustrating that all I can do is pause the music. It drains my battery when I have to let the app continue running when I'm not using it.,neutral
"App crashes, no now playing information. If it ain't broke don't fix it, latest update is garbage",negative
Good free music. Easy to use.,positive
"Used to be good, getting worse. Buttons disappeared. Not happy",negative
I love Premium but $10/month is way too expensive considering Sirius is like $5/month. If Premium was $5/month like Sirius it would be absolutely worth it!!,positive
Excellent Playlist that they select in turns of Jazz.,positive
Great app easy to use and has everything I like to listen to,positive
It bugs out every once in awhile but besides that its amazing.,positive
Good app for songs,positive

Great app.too many commercials,positive
"Randomly stops when listening to music or podcasts. Quite annoying, missing Winamp more everyday.",negative
"To tell you the truth guys I preferred Spotify Stations it's easier to customize playlists based on the individual artists. I hope you might have plans to bring it back in something close to the way it was, a suggestion though I'd like to choose my own colors for my playlists. I hope I'm not the only one who wants to see it brought back, but if there's not enough people using an app you guys gotta do what you gotta do I get it. Thanx for listening.",neutral
"None of the music actually plays. The ads do, but never the music.",negative
"Good app, access to loads and loads of music, ads are annoying but every ad is like that but there is the option to pay for premium, overall I love this app",positive
Great! Love the content! But it doesn't get 5 starts because the app can act up. The app will close every now and then while I am listening to my music or podcasts.,positive
"I don't like when I search a song; that it doesn't let me listen right away. It puts the song in a ""playlist"" that I don't want to hear.",negative
"Spotify was fine, I never paid to remove the ads because I don't mind them. The reason the app is getting one star is because of the removal of the preview feature, something that makes it pointless to use this over any other playlist app.",negative
App performance is good but one thing which make this app not good is a lot of Ads and it is soo irritating so I am disliking it,negative
"Breaking up often (typically every each 9-10 seconds) skipping 2-3 seconds. Extremely annoying. Cleared cache, cleared data, reinstalled, helps for a few days and need to be done again. Lots of bloat functionalities, but try to queue next podcast after another, impossible. Home menu living its own odd life, favourites as well. Looking at blog nobody is doing anything for ever green bugs, sad.",negative
I love the music on it and you can play your favorite songs I wish you play your own music of you choose,positive
Best music software yet,positive
Re-download app because i was having issues and now the app won't even open. Just stays stuck on the spotify symbol. It's more of an issue because I'm paying for premium and I can't even use it! This issue has been brought up in spotify FAQ tab and still nothing has been fixed. Very disappointed. Had to download pandora in the meantime.,negative
Awesome and amazing.,positive
I love all the songs & artists on this app,positive
"Edit: The SD Card trick from online forum works. App is working as intended. Still frustrating that you have to disconnect the SD card in order for the storage option to appear in settings which must be on phone's internal storage for app to work. Mobile app does not work. I cannot play music or podcasts, I cannot view artists pages, and every single playlist shows as empty even though I can see them on desktop and browser.",neutral
"Not sure what's happened with this app. But it skips my songs all the time, just like a CD. I uninstalled/reinstalled and even in between got a new phone. Absolutely NO DIFFERENCE. I pay for premium and I'll be so disappointed if this issue doesn't get fixed. It used to be my favorite for music...unfortunately no longer. Very frustrated.",negative
"Spotify has definitely improved a lot since I started using it a couple years ago. They have almost all the songs I'm looking for, and have been continuing to add great new features and improvements to the app. Sometimes it's a little buggy on my Galaxy A71, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.",positive
"Not great to navigate, and it keeps screwing up to the point where I have to uninstall and reinstall it because it forgets that it's playing my podcast and gets rid of the controls. For $8 a month I can get my content elsewhere, it doesn't even intuitively bring up the next podcast I should be listening to",negative
Great app great access to music but I wish you could listen to songs without wifi without getting premium.,positive
App suddenly stopped working on my Android.,negative

Excellent music variety.,positive
"I would give this a 0 star if possible,i used spotify a lot back in the day.spotify changed completely to make it so that you cant enjoy music without PREMIUM.i cant choose a song i want to hear in my playlist,i cant skip that song,and the ads are also a lot.spotify your so bad now.not all of us can afford premium.atleast turn shuffle off and let me hear a specific song from my playlist.please.thats all i want.",negative
"Good , you can get all songs even the remixes.",positive
I love this app but I had to uninstall then reinstall but everytime I open the app it just stays on the logo tried 3 times it's not working,negative
I am here downloading this app so that I can change my alarm ringtone,negative
The main problem for me it's the absence of Belarusian language. It would be great to use the app in my lang,positive
So far so good but hard to control on my car system but I'm sure that can be tweekled perfected..👍🏽,positive
Brilliant I just love the great selection of artists and the fact you get 14 days abroad was so nice when I recently went to Spain and could chill out listening to my favourite songs and so relaxing. Thank you Spotify.,positive

Yall are getting rid of the voice feature and I'm disappointed,negative
"I am very disappointed, I listen to spotify all the time and am completely tired of stupid suggested songs, I even put on yhe blocker in settings and it still doesnt work!!

Update 7-8-22: The shuffle is busted. Plays only what you recently discovered and spinned a lot. This rule is counter intuitive to what people expect from a shuffle.,negative
My experience with Spotify is just great! Thank you Spotify for everyday.,positive
All of a sudden the app will not work on my S22+,negative
Initially i liked this application but Why the hell it doesn't work on my wifi it only works on my mobile data,negative

"I hated iheartradio, so I am trying this. It is an improvement over iheart so far. However, some things could be streamlined better. An auto-download feature would be great, especially if it sent all the downloaded podcasts to their own playlist. The ability to reorder a playlist or library should be an option. Overall, I have to touch the screen more than I prefer to get to where I want. Updated 7/8/22: new updates have reduced this app to hot garbage.",negative
"Nice app, but when your free trial is over, the quality really goes down, if i search a song it gives me some random person's playlist, and i can't skip to the song i like. Nice app, but only the premium version.",neutral

Would be great if it actually worked. I'm having issues with this app at least 50% of the time.,negative
"In my opinion the add more songs feature is really unhelpful no matter how many playlists I make it reccomends the sake songs over and over and I don't even kind them and the genres they reccomend are completely unrelated to what I Listen to,I think they should add a feature where u can dislike a song or hide it, so it doesnt get reccomended to u again, but where u can still search it up or view it in a folder just incase",neutral
I don't live without Spotify,positive
"The app is so glitchy on Android that it won't let me play any music on my phone. It's been this way for 2 months now, and at the worst time (while I was on a road trip and needed tunes).

"Hi spotify when I listen to my favorite songs, I'm getting poor play back quality. The songs are freezing right in the middle of the song.

I won't need to continue Spotify premium, hopefully this gets fixed so I can come back to enjoy my songs.",negative

I absolutely LOVE my spotify app! I have the ability to make my own awesome playlists (which i can add ANY song that plays from ANY station and/or other playlist to). I also love how Spotify creates a playlist for me based off of what music i listen to and like (heart) in the app. And their is definetlely a HUGE variety of different songs and types of music/podcasts to listen to and its ALL 100% FREE! The ONLY thing i really dislike about the app is that i am not able to just search specifc song,positive
If offline mode was available for the normal version of Spotify like you could save some artists who you like and play their songs,positive

Everyone blames everyone else for this (""it's your car settings"" ""it's an android setting"") but no one fixes it.

"Horrible push towards paid premium, nothing but continuous ads one after each and every song played. Very limited 30 minute free plays if any and now it won't let me use my 6 free skips or it makes my phone skip a song without me touching it. (As of July 2022) makes previously privated playlists public, can't delete old playlists no matter how often I press the button, constantly exiting out of app, just awful.",negative
"Computer version is much better and has a repeating option. On phone app it doesn't work. You can pick the song you wanna hear instead of random, unlike the app",neutral
"There are sooo many problems with Spotify, maybe because I use an android but it keeps on saying that there are connection problems and not letting me access anything, please find a way to allow other android users to make full use of this app",negative
I am facing issue with the app as my wifi and data everything is working it still shows you are offline everytime. I tried troubleshooting but nothing happens.,negative

The ads are disturbing but the overall experience is nice,positive
My dudes i love you but i now cant listen to music when my phones locked. Please fix and ill change rating,negative
"Terrible experience for listening to podcasts, it never remembers last played position of a podcast, it doesn't sink between devices..i.e. my computer and phone.",negative
"Laggy, not as good as it was previous versions. I'm not a fan of the new changes, plus it won't let access songs when I'm offline, when half the time I'm just on cellular. Edit: still having the same problems since may 2022...why have none of the updates fixed these basic problems? I've mostly switched to a different podcast player, but still looking for a good alternative music player.",negative
"Updated rating 7/8/22: the app has become unreliable. Podcasts stop for no apparent reason, especially when screen becomes idle. I installed the app on a different phone with a bigger memory, but this app still stops. Fix your damn app, Spotify.",negative
Excellent app - can find almost anything,positive
"It's a great app for listening music, I have playlists I've made as profile Cheetah345 with probably thousands of songs. I have few complaints other than the fact that premium is just expensive enough that as a teenager with not much income I can't afford to spend that much. Unfortunately you are pushing a political agenda with ads that I am sick of. Every time I listen anymore every single ad is for pro gay junk. I don't want ads for that. It's gotten so bad I can't even use this app anymore",neutral
I build lists of the music I love and explore new music without limits. This is my best music buy in years.,positive
Me and my daughter love Spotify it's one of our most used apps,positive
I really like this app I can find music I haven't heard in decades man I can listen for hours thanks for having a damn good app,positive

Such a rubbish app lots of advertisements i m going to uninstall this app ..,negative
Just had to sit through 6 adds straight as a free user only to it to play a completely different song than the one I clicked on.,negative

I love Spotify. I can find anytjing I want to liaten to. They have any genre I want or if I want a podcast they have it!,positive
The App is amazing but the newest update has been quite Annoying. When I'm trying to play my playlist it always goes to some recommended songs which I can't skip.,negative
"I love this app, but if feels like it will never improve... sometimes it just glitches and refuses to play and you have to exist and enter again... if you try to listen at the same time with friends there's a delay between when you hear the song and they do... even to this day they haven't brought listening activity to mobile... like just have it as a tab that you can open if you want to... there are so many things they could add, but they just don't... such a shame...",neutral
Very good app all genres and era of music Gave 4 stars not that there is an issue just that there is always room for some unknown improvement,positive
Omg 😍😍my fav app ever. It has really good quality💋🥂,positive
"Clearly, this is an amazing app qith the best quality, the only thing i dont pike is that they dont offer all songs, but mist every app has this situation or maybe a worse one. So please, go ditch ur pandora and join spotify, it ia so worth it.",positive
I have lost the ability to pause and skip songs on the app.,negative

this is fantastic app for old and newsing for singing,positive
The 'What's playing' facility has disappeared. The most basic feature - gone. Not good enough.,negative
"I love your music ..thank you so much for sharing this ,great job..",positive
Excellent music app,positive
Works but feels rough and clitchy. Unbelievable that such a big brand like Spotify cannot make an app thats well intrgrated with a premium android device. This should be a AAA title. I'm using GalaxyS20 and constantly have issues with simple stuff. Like pausing the music or controlling the app through galaxyBuds. Often freezes and music stays playing in the background with no way of turning it off other than hard closing the app. AndoidAuto experience is even worse.,negative
"Thanks for dumping all my downloads without even telling me! Appreciate that! I also love how when I don't have cellular reception, you won't let me play the podcasts that I already downloaded. I also love how as time goes on the more glitchy and unreliable the app becomes. Thanks for letting me down, Spotify!",negative
Not happy with the hey Spotify thing. I don't like it taking away my control while I'm in a vehicle.....or maybe this is just a bug.,negative
Logedin on my family premium plane to listen to music on plan flight and loged out wen u landed and I now just can't get in I have uninstalled it 3 times and it won't work,negative
Lots of good music but lots of adds,positive
Continually riddled with issues. Currently it will just quit playing on me. It does not seem like Spotify truly cares about customers through my experience I have continually felt ignored in that the issues are generally left unresolved for an excessive amount of time... Awesome to know it wasn't just my device because I just upgraded to the s22 ultra and the issues are still here with liked song filters like I've complained about for months,negative
"The music options are great, podcasts are great, but functionally it doesn't work half the time. You play a song and there is a bug that causes the app not to show the pause and play buttons. They don't reappear until I restart my phone. Have to force close the app to stop playing anything. Can't skip any songs. Really an app breaking bug.",negative
Better than the other satellite radio station offered. I like that you can customize your music. I have the premium subscription with no advertising great option.-,positive
"This app is great, if you are reading this you definitely need to download it",positive
Still garbage. If I wasn't so deep into creating my library using Spotify I would use a different app. Constantly have to redownload everything for absolutely no discernable reason. App closed and reopened? Guess you're downloading your entire library for the third time this week.,negative
"I prefer free coz it always drive me crazy when i m choosing e wallet payment methode, gopay or telkomsel, all the same...",negative
"I'm giving this two stars for no other reason that Spotify intentionally screws over desktop users by denying them important features which are ONLY on the app. Why can't I block artists on desktop? Why force me to use the app? I'd use it anyway, but making me HAVE to is just kinda butts.",negative
I pay money for this every month and it is garbage. I've loved Spotify for years. Now they can't get it right. I'm seriously about to end my subscription and switch.,negative
"This is mony app no install this app, wink is best and gana is best app😒😒",negative

"WOW MANY SONG DJ, ROCK,ROMANTIC, WOW THIS IS SO SUPER APP",positive
"I've been using YouTube Music for 3 years but a few days ago I bought Spotify premium edition to see which one is better, To be honest Spotify has better playlists so it's a better app to find your new songs that you like but YouTube Music has a part that mixes songs for you but it changes every week so I think it's not good as Spotify is, But to be honest again YouTube Music has a better design for its app and if you won't spend money for Music application YouTube music's free edition is better",positive
"Worst audio quality in the market. It's more a social network, if you really like music this is not your app.",negative
Everything's fine about Spotify but the shuffle option often repeats tracks. Please improve shuffle option,positive
Very poor when offline,negative
"This app is the best music app I have ever seen but there are some covers which are not here like ""Sure thing"" by BLACKPINK and ""Clarity"" by Jisoo...Pls update those in the app...other then this everything is awesome ❤️❤️❤️",positive
I used this and it was the best app for music,positive
Crashes on android everytime I go full screen. I thought this was a mature app? Where is quality control?,neutral
"App is terrible. It always errors out, crashes, fails to display a toggle bar for whatever you are listening to in order to pause or skip ahead. How can such a big company have such an awful platform.",negative
It's easy to safe and play my favorite tunes. I have been able to hear and save everything that I requested to listen to.,positive
App is good but had lot of trouble logging in once logged out,neutral
I've been using Spotify since I first started using a phone. I can bear with the ads and everything but for some reason recently the music would just stop when I went to other apps and I'd have to start the song from the beginning again. It happened a couple times and I thought that it's okay but it's been happening so much recently its really getting on my nerves,neutral
Ads are more I am not interested in this app i am deleting it,negative
Love using Spotify for whatever I like to listen to. Everything about it is AMAZING!! NO faults.,positive
Spotify continues to surprise me with the depth of music available - always uplifts my day!,positive
"Love the app, have had it for years, but I just got a new phone (Galaxy S22), and since then when I use Spotify, my queue doesn't pop up when I start listening, I can't pause or go back and forward in any podcast or song/playlist. Obviously this is annoying if you want to check how long is left on a podcast or song, or missed something that was said now can't hear again without starting over, or worse needing to pause for a variety of reasons. Please fix",neutral
User friendly and makes good suggestions,positive
"Highly Recommended. Mostly all the songs available, but, I wish there was some sort of thing in which we could request the songs we wanted to have but, overall it's actually way more better than any other music streaming app I've ever used. The ads are just a misconception. The ads are never TOO MUCH or back to back. They come occasionally which I guess is pretty tolerable for anyone who's not using the premium. Keep up with the good job.",positive
Easy to use able to find the music I enjoy,positive
"The app will not even open anymore. I logged out and since then it stays at the loading screen. I've tried reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, even tried waiting it out. Nothing. Just a big logo that never goes away.",negative
Good application for listening music and podcast,positive
"It's a fun app, lots of diversity options.",positive
"I am seriously considering looking for another music streaming aap. For weeks player keeps vanishing. Can't control this aap, pause or stop playing. It's not free application. This is ridiculous.",negative
This is a very good service for laptops and desktops but the new updates are totally ruining the experience for mobile users and making it horrible. There used to be a kebab menu (three dots) icon whenever you searched a song which allowed you to add it to a playlist directly. Now you must play the song before adding it to a playlist because the three dots disappeared. Also mobile users don't have the option of rearranging the songs on a playlist. Please resolve these issues ASAP.,neutral
Compare as ganna Spotify is 10000%best i really love it !! Best app,positive
Just let me view the creators songs not recommended songs. It's so annoying.,neutral

"WAYYY to restricting! This app annoys me because its literally Forcing me to buy premium. I shuffle in my playlist and it plays a completely different song i havent put in my playlist Its so annoying that i have to shuffle in order to get the song i want to play cause if i click a song, it doesn't even play it. I dont even get the song i wanna play! I only get 6 skips per hour and the updates they make are a HUGGEEE downgrade. Im done with this app.",negative
"I only really use this app for podcasts. I still don't understand why it will stop my current episode and then go to a random one. It's very annoying, happens daily.",negative
"Need a mental piece of mind but this app would let me. The ads are pretty annoying, talks about Spotify premium all the time like I would purchase. If I did then it will be over my dead body. Deleting the app. Sayonara #crapapp",negative

"I Just Love this app!! It is the absolute 💯 best music streaming service!! It allows you to create your own Playlist and will make one for you according to your taste. And has all the oldies, 80's, 90's and many Genres of music. Let's you get up close with the artist without all these hidden fees and Agenda!!

Love Spotify it's the best,positive
"broken app, no more 30 mins of uninterrupted listening",neutral
"I hate that i can't listen to what I want. I can't choose a song, and I have to wait and listen to the whole playlist to hear song i want. I also hate limited skips and how Spotify itself puts songs on my playlists. The sound quality is really good but you have to fix somethings",neutral
ads more than songs,negative
Its a good app for music but the ads 😅 they are very annoying 😡 but I just bought a premium membership just a request give download option for free users,positive
Really a superb app but i give only 3 stars because there are one advertisement at a single song.so kindly avoid it,neutral

I cannot control the app or terminate a group session - none of the controls are working, even after stopping it from the OS app manager, clearing cache and data, and re-signing in. Unacceptable for a paid app.",negative
Overall the app is pretty good except that its a bit confusing on a phone rather than on a laptop. I also don't like how on a phone you can't choose what song you want to play from your playlist and you only get to hear a snippet of the song. Please change this because it comes to a very big disadvantage for people who do not wish to purchase premium.,neutral
"Hi there, I have uninstall this app in my handphone and i have check play store there is also no spotify app in my account.. Why do i still have to pay for the subscription fees? Able to assist please. Thank you.",negative

Spotify music app is very useful to attract people makes them for relation and happy. 🎤🎻🎹🎧🇨🇳🧧👘🐉,positive
Normally would've given this app 5 stars but I didn't because of the following reason: -Apps are supposed to be better than the web version but not with this app. The shuffle option is very frustrating to deal with when you just want to listen to one song on mobile. You'll have to go through multiple songs just to listen to the one song you wanted to listen to. What doesn't make sense is why I don't have this issue on my tablet but I do on my phone. Can't loop either. Please fix this issue.,neutral
"Easier to use than Pandora for sure, the skip limit on here is bigger too",positive
I have downloaded this app about three times now and I can just log in or sign up..it keeps telling me am offline or try again even though I have strong network connection... This is not good at all,negative

I can't play the songs I select - no matter whether I uninstall or log out and log in again. Extremely frustrating.,negative
"The UI is super intuitive, the premium features are cool, it just great overall. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is how it doesn't really pay artist well.",positive
First time user - thumbs up! Not sure what it can do yet.,positive

"Recent update broken With this last update I have been unable to access any music. It won't play anything. It doesn't allow me to even play downloaded, or even show my music or podcasts. Fabulous, back to not sleeping well. Upset because it's been fine for years. And now that I rely on the stories and mediations to sleep, now it decides to not work at all.",negative
I enjoy all the podcasts,positive
Plays songs that aren't even on the the liked song playlist and just litters it with songs from genre you don't even like listening. Good luck listening to something like metal because you'll get forced to listening to love songs for lonely people.,negative
Spotify you are the best,positive
"I love the app, even without premium you still get great music options and an awesome experience! 10/10 recommend!!",positive
I really enjoy Spotify. I make my own playlist. put my ear buds on and get lost in my music thanks Spotify yall rock 🎸,positive

Great song choices.,positive
Won't play other songs after clicking the play button and I can't figure out where to turn off shuffle for my liked Playlist.,negative
"Well I do got to say had to change my mind at first I thought this site sucks what not and in the end if you do your due diligence you can get back your accounts they're pretty cool you just got a member save save your Everything download whatnot it's just got to be a better way to download it to your SD card and s*** like that when you have 100,000 songs other than that f****** Spotify Spotify hit him up download it and go you guys rock 100%",positive
Even though you have to have premium to pick a song it's pretty good,positive
"I really enjoy using this app, but I do have one suggestion. I'd love it if we were able to create playlist folders on mobile. It'd make it much easier to look through my library. Still though, wonderful to use! <3",positive
l you can't cancel the subscription it gives you the runaround and I had to cancel my debit card over it,negative

Been using spotify for 6 or 7 years and had all together a year or more of premium. Was a great app but now I'm literally getting ads every 2 songs. So I can't recommend it anymore.,negative
"Overall, a great application for listening to music 10/10 for that. However the app has some bugs sooo uhhh yeah, I can't even open the app anymore without being stuck on the logo sooo you guys lose points there. 8/10 would recommend.",positive
"I love it on my Xbox but the mobile app is poorly formatted and impossible to use, and the limited skips an hour is bs, when you run out you can just change the song manually, and why can't you view the songs on a Playlist as a list of individuals like on xbox, the littoral console with a controller being your only way of control, that's right, the xbox version is better formatted than the mobile peice of junk.",negative
Best music streaming service ever!!,positive
I love it the best music app thanks,positive
"Probably my most used app, I use it every day and have never not used it. Full ratings deserved",positive
Spotify is a good music app not that many adds and I would really recommend it to my friends.,positive
Great way to find and listen to all types of music and get introduced to new artists. But the fact that I can't listen to the song I want to without buying the premium service is extremely annoying. If you want to ask that serves as customizable radio for yourself this is the one for you.,neutral
The best app to listen to advertisements,negative
A Great experience when you can see the progression of your own music on here flourish you provide a lot for us musicians keep the good work up and fighting for the artists rights and best interest,positive

It works good on pc but on the phone it's garbage.... When i click to play a song it automatically shuffles to another song that i did not click on... No way you can take off the shuffle at all so i had to uninstall it...,negative
"Good selection, not so good app.",negative
Always great quality. Always works great.,positive
Spotify is one of the best music apps on this planet! There are absolutely NO ads! Nothing gets in the way of Spotify's music!,positive
"Haven't used this app for a very long time and I don't followed any changes, but before I was able to listen one song, I had to watch 8 (!) ads. Like 3 X 30 seconds and 5 X 15 seconds ad. The song was shorter than those ads",negative
"Best music app ever, I used to spend 100 bucks a month on CDs but now 9.99 is all and the best part is that this app finds great new music I would never have found! I LOVE YOU SPOTIFY ""PLATONIC OF COURSE""!",positive

"Recent update needs urgent bug fix!! Control bar missing, music glitches when I turn off phone screen or navigate apps, and sometimes my phone will just start playing randomly now. I don't know what you guys did, but a quick fix would be to just restore an update to last patch. Love Spotify but can't use (or want to pay for) an app like this....",negative
When I clicked on the songs I wanted to hear it sometimes puts other songs but overall it has all my favorite songs so yeah idk lol I still recommend it to a lot of people,positive
"It keeps on turning my music off as well as changing to music that's not even in my playlists. Me giving it one star might be a bit harsh but, I would like to listen to the music I choose otherwise what's the point of a playlist.",negative
"The app isn't working on my phone anymore (Samsung A20). It was working just fine before the more recent update, but now all the playlists are empty and I can't play a single song (and no, I don't have offline mode turned on).",negative

"Ot was good until they started musically profiling me using radio wave brainwave frequency mindhacking devices. Now, all if the lyrics are different than the artist's and it's nerve wracking..",neutral
I couldn't open my Spotify account anymore!,positive
You're better off paying for youtube music. There is no way to cancel your account/subscription if you forgot any credentials like a password or user name. Have sent them several emails to attempt to cancel since you can't call them but there is no way to cancel because they say they can't find my account but they are charging me for it.,negative
I switched to Spotify after Google discontinued play music and haven't regretted it.,positive
Seems like the random stopping of music has been fixed.thank you! And also people If you can accept what's included on the free spotify aspotify app just upgrade And stop complaining!!,positive
"I love this app. However, recently it's been glitchy. I can't control the songs. The control features are gone. The app stops. Please fix soon.",negative

I would have given it a 5out of 5 but not bc it don't let me replay a song,positive
Spotify app has been kept abruptly freezing and unstable in my One plus 9R device. Requesting team to look into the same. It's more guess because of the recent OS update by one plus,neutral
"Great app, although it can be glitchy at times. Paying for premiums so worth it.",positive
"What's happened? I've been using Spotify for years with no problems. But now podcasts keep randomly pausing, and the control bar has disappeared so I can no longer easily play and pause, or use the sleep function. This app isn't cheap and with this reduced functionality I feel I'm getting a poor deal.",negative
"The worst app I've ever used, ads all the time and a lot of them, six skips AN HOUR plus not being able to play any song you like you have to listen to a whole Playlist in a random order with a few songs you were actually looking for, I also constantly run into problems that span across four phones and a laptop so it isn't my device, another limitation is listening on only one device at a time and it takes a little to switch, the only thing I use it for is listening to podcasts which isn't bad",negative
"I always used to like this app and it was my favourite app to listen music or podcasts to, but lately I can't really download anything even though I have plenty of storage left and the app keeps on stopping. I deleted the app multiple times and restarted my phone but nothing works and after the last update everything just got worse.",negative
Excellent service with all chromecast devices,positive
"It's ok, but $10/month is too much to pay, especially knowing how little the artists actually get out of that money.",negative
"I will only rate 5 if you include option ""Set Music As"" Ringtone, Alarm Tone and Message Alert tone. Edit: I'm lowering my rating more because it's annoying that it doesn't have option to remove a certain song directly from my playlist. I still need to get out and find the song to remove it instead of it being available when you click the 3 dots.",negative
"Great app, just wish there were cheaper plans bc when your a kid and dont make bank and you want to listen to music...you dont really have the funds to give up 10 dollars a month...I know it doesn't sound like a lot but if you think about it, you not ""getting"" anything, you are enjoying music, and I guess you can just use the default like I do but it is just limiting. The app itself is great and has huge options and good quality, not glitchy and is great!",positive
Worst song app because it's have an add in between of songs so worst,negative
"So far so good .... Came over from another streaming service and its only the first billing month , I have had no problems and the library is much better, lots more podcast to choose from and .... I dont even miss Neil Young ✌",positive
"This is a bad app. Resso is much better than Spotify. A song is repeated over and over again. I wanted to give it zero star, but There is no system for that. I'm uninstalling it.",negative
All previous comments been covered. Started off brilliant under premium plan. Now ads coming fast as. I didn't pay to listen to ads & lose playlists etc. I'm canceling subscription.,negative
The app won't even launch on my phone Just keeps showing the Spotify logo I'm disappointed,negative
Very good app but so many ads,positive
Spotify is the perfect name....spotty at best. I cant believe how many times the app plays music and sometimes it just doesnt want to. Mix that with zero phone support and fix the problem is a joke. I pay for this service for way to long now it just doesnt work at all. Ive looked at all forums and nothing has fixed the problem.,negative
"Recently I've been having issues with my mobile app, sometimes a song will play but the profile of that song will be a different song, it's laggy. I normally fixed the issue by restarting my phone or updating my spotify app. My most annoying issue though is that I can't even open my mobile app anymore, it just leaves me on the black loading splash screen page with the green logo but never loads. It kinda sucks right now considering I pay for premium. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10",neutral
"Best app to listen to music, unfortunately some of the rarest song & artist that i was looking forward to listen sometime not available 😢",positive
"Still buggy but functional. I still see bugs that are really confusing and frustrating. Beyond that, it's alright. Shuffle doesn't work properly. Will improve rating with further bug fixes and shuffle improvement",neutral
"I'm having the same issues as some of the last reviews, Spotify keeps pausing 3-4 times a song. It's very frustrating and I've starting using another service. Hopefully they can get this problem resolved asap.",neutral
It's bad it doesn't let you pick your own song. It's so confusing,negative
I spoke with customer service for hours about an issue I was having and the final conclusion was that the issue was with my phone model. If you have issues that are specific to a device you should clearly market it as such if you aren't going to fix it.,negative
One of the best music app,positive
"My go to music app, first started using it years ago because no connection was needed to hear my playlists and I have never strayed.",positive
I find every song every time,positive
Damn My profile picture was in my Spotify and click man I love the playlist thank you so much,positive
Excellent at guessing what kind of music I'd like to hear next. Always a great listening experience.,positive
"Every song you've heard and more is on here, however, 1 BIG ISSUE, when I enter the app it will say ""nothing playing"" when there is very much something playing and it will play in the background but I can't control it at all from my notification bar",positive
Awesome app that stays up to date with the latest rap and hip hop. My favorite app for music by far.....,positive
It is because you don't have the right lyrics for a song,negative
Won't show current song playing leaving one to scour the web based on lyrics! So much fun,negative
So bad. Ads that will lag your device [S10] and will pop up and start playing random song's at random times. Try YT music and audible The programs MUST be trolling.,negative
I don't want to give money just to listen to a specific song,negative
Constant crash and video restarts. Instantly connects and plays last video to any Bluetooth device you are connected to,negative
I wish that you didn't have to buy a membership to listen to most the songs,positive
doesnt save offline to sd card properly,neutral
very good just wish their were less without having to pay,positive
"It's been overall great improvement within couple of years and audio quality is great. The app synchronise between devices perfectly and I love this feature to switch between devices while playing song. I only thing I found weak is song suggestions, though I am using this app from couple of years but still it doesn't recommend or make an auto playlist which I like and groove. Please start using better AI so it can suggest and make better playlist for different users.",positive
how do i play a songinstead of a damn playlist..... please.. tell me.... i cant figure out after about an hour,negative
Yes it's good cause i like jazz wt all my heart,positive
It won't even load and that's very upsetting considering I was charged for it.,negative
I might as well just totally discontinue usage of this service. I hope they didn't layoff good staff for high school interns.,positive
"As of 7/7, this issue has been resolved. I have changed my review to reflect this change It is normally great, but recently the app has been stopping audio randomly, not letting me pause or fast forward, the pop-up doesn't appear so I can't scroll in the song. I have to close the app to stop the music. While listening to podcasts, the podcast will stop and I will have to start over. Due to bugs in the current update, I'm not able to fast forward to where I was.",positive
"Great choice of music, easy to create playlist and music always at my fingertips 💃",positive
I am thoroughly enjoying Spotify and the flexibility that I have with this streaming service to create Playlist of my favorite types of music.,positive
Spotify music player good app,positive
"I've been a long time user of spotify and love the amount and quality of music I can use, but recently it's like I'm paying for nothing. Everytime I try to load my downloaded songs I have to close the app a couple times before it will load. I pay to have the ability to listen offline and am not getting that.",negative
I pay for premium and lately its been very aggressive about pausing my music whether im on wifi or data. Its been happening to alot of people ive talked to as well. Please fix it,neutral
Spotify plays all of my favorite songs 🎵,positive
"A must app. But payment issues in Nepal and can we download the lyrics please. Considering these minor things , Spotify is great app to listen to music",positive
I gat everything i need right on spotify..,positive
You can find just about any song I don't get ads.,positive
I would give this app five stars if it dinin't have so many ads,positive
New update and a new problem comes up!! Now i can't search for my playlists! Can't queue properly. Uninstalled and reinstalled and it's crashed three times on chromecast in 20 minutes! You guys really are total idiots. And now artists tracks are missing. Utterly useless.,negative
Really enjoy the music. No technical problems.,positive
I enjoy listening to my music in Spotify but it's kind of dumb to listen to your songs and get an ad interruption durning a song other wise I would've rate a 5 but I give you 3 rating it could be better,neutral
"Improve feature as like if u right swipe the playlist, they gets queued as well, just like songs",positive
"Used for a year, and it's better than Pandora, however.. Missing the most basic feature, play history. This is why I refuse to pay. I use Pandora and Spotify to discover new music, and when I can't look up who just played, whats the point really? Edit: Still broken.",negative
Love this versatile option for exploring and enjoying my music choices,positive
So many great songs to choose from!!,positive
"You guys should add JPop to the main genres on the menu, just as you've added Kpop.",negative
"Using this every day, all the time. Subscription is worth it.",positive
This app is so hard to navigate on phone if I click a a song a have liked it goes to didn't song I never heard or it might play a demo of the song that is dumb it should play the song,negative

App doesn't even open! Uninstalled it and re downloaded it and nothing still not working !,negative
"Use to have beats that then turned in apple music,(which did not like at all) found out about Spotify and do not regret getting it.",positive
On my galaxy s22 this app is unreliable at best. Podcasts drop off or the app crashes and I can't stop the track and Spotify doesn't remember were I was inside of the podcast. It's not usable.,negative
Excellent choices in music based on my tastes,positive
"generally good (Spotify is a great service). removing a star because their team seems generally unwilling to listen to feedback from the user community. just go look at their help forums for tons of examples where an issue is reported, backed up by hundreds of users, but no indication they will work on it. please fix the shuffle algorithm! I have a 40 hour playlist but end up hearing the same songs every day.",positive
"Endless issues, stops and/or starts without any reason, plays episodes I didn't request. Frequently stops and won't play at all. It's the worst of all the podcast players I use - I only use it because I can't get Rogan anywhere else. If it wasn't for Joe Rogan and the Dark Horse podcast, I'd dump it in a heartbeat and never miss it.",negative
I love the Spotify app. Especially the lyrics feature...I can sing along!,positive
Love it!!! Great work out tool also.,positive
Definitely a good app for music or podcasts. The premium subscription thing is probably a bit overpriced though.,positive
"Nothing. After I registered and pay premium mini I can't play or add, open profile of my account. How it this even possible? Plus daily mox from Spotify aslo marked as empty",negative
I love that I can listen to my downloaded music without using my data.,positive
I enjoy spotify.every song I want it right here,positive
"Love it especially every favorite song i play, especially since I'm a huge music head.",positive
UI needs work (by that I mean just a simple feature to be added as to swipe down on the mini player and that ends the song )so far so good tho,positive
"Very spotty servers, laggy mobile and desktop apps that crash and hang with no explaination despite top tier hardware. Catalog shrinking due to political and copywrite nonsense.",negative
This is the worst podcast player. Everything is harder than it should be.,negative
I loved when i downloaded it but after like one week it's forcing to buy the premium version. I can't even play i single song without buying it. It's really annoying! I loved this app & keep wanted to use it but...,positive
I don't understand why Spotify needs my mic in order to work. Otherwise I have no trouble with the app.,positive
It was a ok app didn't have it that long was use to pandora music playing guess I will try it again some day,neutral

It's the best music app to listen to your favorites songs,positive
Everything works and sounds great.,positive
Good stuff on spotify,positive
It takes so long just to download,negative
Ok so here's the deal Spotify has this new update where they add there recommended songs on there...this is a problem because you come to Spotify yo listen to your Playlist and the music you like now all you here on YOUR Playlist is songs you don't know and can't sing along to...the only way to get rid of it is by adding at least 15 songs to your Playlist! So me being like ok I did so...for awhile everything was good but the Spotify kept playing songs that I didn't add! USELESS!!!,negative
This app is good but pls make an update where i can delete recent played pls PLSS I BEG YOU,positive
"Long time user. Lately it's been full of glitches. Can't control the app, it always says Spotify is trying to play, it randomly pauses whatever you're listening to every few minutes. It's almost unusable right now. Its a shame because it's been my go to for so long 😕",negative
I love this app but when i try to listen to my fav song it puts something else that's why i am giving you 1 star make it ok please,negative
Love Spotify I recemend it to all my friends absolutely love the blend play list,positive

"Amazing for music. Glitchy and extremely unreliable for podcasts. Please fix it asap, Premium doesn't feel very premium anymore. Edit: One year later and the issue remains. 2 star becomes 1 star.",negative
I've used spotify for years and have payed for premium for a few years now. Recently the app has started skipping and cutting the music like a broken record. The problem stops when my phone screen is either unlocked or at least on. I've tried all of the recommended fixes online. None of them have worked. If the problem persists I will be canceling my premium subscription.,negative
"Does whatever it wants, it's easily the worst of the apps similar to it. It turns podcasts on or off at will and changes the podcast mid episode and loses its place which can be annoying to go back and track down where you left off. All this especially since 99% of the time I'm using the app while driving. Not a fan but I got a prompt to review the app so here it is.",negative
"Very interesting! great format , real lovely",positive
"This is probably just a personal experience, but I've reinstalled the app three times, restarted my phone, and cleared the cache twice but the app won't work. It will open and just show me the logo. I'm not even given the option to sign in.",negative

Spotify has introduced me to so much great music based on what I already listen to. Every music lover should have this app!,positive
"After few minues of installing the app, and after I opened it, I was surprised by the ammount of restrictions that you add to the app, to a level that you maked it dead. It is like someone is in a prison or detention. I hate how you put the users in this situation to pay premium which is not accepted. Although, if you would like to make the app better, at least show how it is cool and useful for at least the first few days, then I might think if maybe I would like to purchase the premium.",negative
Just awesome and easy,positive
The fact that the sometimes you can't end group session and needing to reinstall it every time is cancer. Because of that sometimes the reinstalled app can't open. You can't even do a damn group session on the desktop like bro it's 2022 how badly advance do you want it to be.,negative
i love it!!! very useful and worth it u should try,positive

For example, today I was playing my liked song and it jumped into another playlist. And now I can't even change the song or playlist. What the heck is this?",negative
Spotify premium is great app to play all your fav music!,positive
Why you added that hiding feature? Because it sucks when I want to unhide any song!,negative

"Echoing the feedback from other premium users - the app was working perfectly fine until a few months ago. Now podcasts and music pause without obvious reasons, and some of the buttons disappear randomly. It's really frustrating.",neutral

This is best app because all songs are available on it and also my favourite Kaira l love *Spotify* Thank you *Spotify*for this you are amazing,positive
The hell is wrong with Spotify. It always play the wrong music,negative
Why can't I use the app for a few days now? I tried uninstalling installing. Even rebooting my phone and yet nothing happens. I need to stream.,neutral
"The User Interface needs to be a little more usable when it comes to reporting songs with swear words in as some are missed. Also, they do not include certain swear words into the explicit category so I will often hear s*** in songs and no E next to them.",positive
Best music app so far,positive

This is a AMAZING app and I feel that it has all of the songs I ever want to play and I am glad I downloaded it.,positive
Brilliant music experience.,positive
"I really don't understand how one of the biggest music apps on the planet can be this buggy. Frequently missing the ""now playing"" tab at the bottom of the app, which means all controls (skip, pause, etc) are missing. Randomly says ""no internet connection"" while clearly connected to the internet and streaming. If you search for a song and play it, then let it autoplay similar songs afterwards, you can't go back and listen to the original song without backing out and selecting the song again.",negative
It's not opening. The app isn't opening,negative
Best platform for streaming music tbh,positive
"Was good at one point. A very long time ago. Now just fluffs its own playlists with fake artists. Spotify has discovered its more profitable to pay themselves than it is to pay actual people, and has stuffed its playlists with fluff to smother out actual artists. Couple this with the horrible death spiral that is Daily Mixes (read: same 25 songs you heard yesterday, plus all the songs you tapped ""block"" on- in case you changed your mind) and also F ""car thing"". I have a stereo but yall ruined it",negative

Good but please add an option to rearrange songs in our playlist again. Don't wanna open my PC and Google Chrome again and again just to do it.,positive
App will not load just flashing Spotify symbol and no customer support to fix it. I've had it since Google music stopped 2 years ago. I've loved Spotify since but for the past week the app won't load. I've uninstalled and installed 90 times but still won't load. Spotify needs custom service and support. You don't value our money or membership if you can't provide that much,negative

Number 1 aap in all music apps,positive
"It's a good app, but I don't like how you have to get premium to unshuffle your playlists.",neutral
Love the app when it's working. I'm paying 10 bucks a month for something to crash every 15 min and I've been waiting for over a month for it to be fixed and it's not the app timer cause I checked. If it's not fixed soon I'll find and pay for another service cause dealing with this for 10 hours a day while I'm at work is ridiculous.,negative

What am I even paying for at this point? Even when the songs are downloaded and I am ""offline""!! And you can't speak with a human about these issues, there is no telephone number!! Soooooo disappointed 😞. Im also looking into other music options now",negative
I love Spotify! Not only for music but I listen to podcasts before I go to bed each night. It helps me drift off to sleep 😴,positive

"I love Spotify, but I've been having trouble using it since an Android update from a few days ago (I have a Samsung A50). I can't access any kind of media, whether it be albums, playlists, podcasts. All the songs have disappeared, but I still can see that the playlists (and so on) exists. Please fix this bug!!",positive
It's really nice as you can make your own playlists but it doesn't show songs by its self. You need to search them and then add them all one by one.,positive
"*UPDATE* Still no response re my emails. So disappointed. Time to cancel services I think. The status band from the bottom of the screen is gone. I can't pause, skip forward or back etc and it makes navigating the app frustratingly difficult. I have emailed a help request twice now with no response. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I've logged out and back in. Still nothing. For an app I pay a premium price for I would think somebody would interested in resolving the issue.",negative
Easy to navigate App with all your fav tunes,positive
HiFi promised by the end of 2021 yet still not available. All competitors have HiRes music and most have spacial audio. Spotify is so far behind the competition at this point. Can't wait to cancel.,negative
Never needed to look anywhere else for a specific song.,positive
Hlo Sir I am Spotify user sir I request your premium plan on payment method in play store i requested you pls open the service in play store payment pls i humble request,negative
"Spotify has become smoother since my last review, so I have to clear the app out of history a lot less. I'm not a big fan of the new plus button in the bottom right corner. I don't need to make a new playlist so often that a dedicated spot in the menu is necessary and I don't make podcasts at all. This button is functionally pointless for me and moved the other buttons that I used slightly to the left. Overall, still a great app. I'm just nitpicking the constant changes to the UI.",positive
Constant problems with this app for 2 straight years. All that money and can't put out a good app that simply works...,negative
Great music. Easy to navigate.,positive

"Since you've updated this app, it no longer connects to the dedicated Spotify app on my Pioneer Head unit, only through the phones Bluetooth. This has been proven by people uninstalling and reinstalling an older version though an apk install. Please fix. Zero interest from Spotify brings this down to one star due to lack of any customer service.",negative
There is no option to download single song. Download is available for full album Only. So add icon to download one by one song.,negative
"I love it.... I will recommed this app for everyone to use♡ i loved the most is that it shows lyrics in every single song and it it has a really few adds, you all guys know how irritating the adds are😢but you will not face that problem in spotify👍👍👍I loved your application.",positive
After using Spotify premium for 3 months it's nice but if you don't pay for it you will have a hell of a time doing anything on the app.,negative
"Do not buy premium. You still get ads for podcasts. It is not the podcasts' ads, they are supplemental ads that go straight to spotify. On top of that, they have overoptimized this just like every other app. Convenient to switch from car play to non car play, only problem is the floating button is placed right over the play button for a song or album. These overlooked problems are everywhere. Buttons on top of buttons, settings not saving, network not updating. I cant justify $9.99/month anymore",negative
"Spotify is a nice app and I like it very much but all of a sudden the songs in my playlist aren't visible and there are only names of the songs. I can't order the songs in the way that I want and I can't see what song is next. I deleted Spotify and installed it again but it didn't work, I also cleared chache but that still did nothing.",negative

"Terrible really. Slow to load menus, searches, library. Sometimes it wont even load my saved songs for minutes forcing me to restart the app. Even worse if it's in offline mode. Often just stops playing randomly and has to be reset to work again. Terrible app",negative
Whenever I randomly open the app (randomly) it just keeps stopping and I don't know why tap on a podcast another song starts playing.... It's not that my phone lags or something else but no my phone is brand new and about about my connection then I really have a very strong connection....

However, I can replay my songs that are on my daily mixes ;) Recently, however, Spotify has been messing with my phone. I know it is spotify because when I uninstall it, the stuff stops. Spotify, please stop pausing and skipping my music, stop pausing my YouTube videos and not letting me play them. Stop playing your music at random times when the app isn't even open.",neutral
Great content! Drops out sometimes or turns off for unknown reason.. but great free app!,positive

I'm a premium user and can say this app is so buggy it's insane while listening to podcasts they constantly restart and i have to try and figure out where I left off because when it does restart it also marks the entire podcast as played so you have no clue where you left off on top of that since the new update i can't access what is actually playing on the app at all it doesn't even say I'm listening to anything and I'm unable to pause unless i close the app fix it I'm sick of paying for broken,negative

"why did the shuffle option change when you listen one of your playlists ? it just sucks, the same songs play on repeat and you juste have to skip them MULTIPLE TIMES when you could just skip them once before, and just go on with your 45h of songs. Also the linked songs in the radio are the same that are already in my playlists, yeah I like them but what I wanted was discover new ones... and if you want to remove them from radio because you already know them it just delete them from your playlist",negative

The problem is that I'm trying to listen to my music but on phone there is no way to stop the randomized song option which chooses from your Playlist which doesn't sad to bad until you notice that they also added songs so play instead of your music and I've spent an hour deleting music off my Play list that I didn't even add and after I finished they added more songs so basically what I'm saying is is that I can't even listen to the songs I like when using this app,negative

I enjoy listening to my christian favorite songs,positive
excellent application more than the others.,positive
Your better off listening to music on YouTube because then at least you may actually be able to pick what song you want to play on a playlist instead of it forceing it to being random every time and sometimes it'll play stuff that's not even on your playlist and the only way to skip it is to have premium or use one of your six skips for the day. The only reason I'm keeping it is to keep track of which songs I actually like so that way I can listen to them on YouTube. would not use again,negative
Amazing music app,positive

I tried to play lofi music to relax and it played We Don't Talk About Bruno. Its kinda annoying that I have a small chance it'll ACTUALLY play the song I want. I'm still gonna keep trying though. I also keep getting ads for period pads which is kinda gross 🤨",negative

It is a wonderful app. It has all. Kind of songs and can be operated on both PC and mobiles.,positive
"This app is easily the best music streaming app when you pay for premium. No ads, offline downloads, great recommendations, unbelievably high audio quality, and a very user friendly UI. Without premium, you have relentless ads, lesser audio quality, no offline downloads, you're not allowed to ever turn off shuffle play. I get most of these, but when you lock playing albums in order behind a paywall, I think you're getting a little money hungry. Just pay premium and you'll get your money's worth",positive
Fun fun fun!,positive
I just really like for the music,positive
It's bad in the sense because it provide all benefits just in the paid version. I mean to say some benefits also provide to the free version.,negative

Well I love this app the platform is so accessible and easy but mainly if you have Spotify premium like if you don't have it you usually have to play an ad or a couple to play 1 song or it plays a song in the same genre.

"Linkable to many services and devices. Selections somewhat diverse. Convenient w/ offline DL's (paid)《BUT》Poor shuffle randomizer. Wasteful efforts on useless features, IE: Strange Things mode. I mean really? A feature only experienced on a single page? I mean, who watches the screen whILE LISTENING? even MTV learned that years ago. But the penultimate reason I can't give above 3 is they don't pay artist's a fair share of THE profits. SO Much so that many musicians boycott Spotify.",positive

I have always loved the Spotify app. And I have always been impressed with the improvements made over the years. But here lately when I go to turn my volume up or down when I'm on the app. My phone bogs down and almost freezes. When it does this it won't let me do anything untill the volume slider is gone. It acts like I get 5fps when I hit my volume,positive

I have premium and this is dissapointing.",positive

Good music app. Missing some songs I love. Charged me wrong once.,positive
Intermittent audio on all devices using Samsung phones (2 different models) and different BT devices. I uninstalled Spotify and then reinstalled. So far so good.

I haven't had any problems with this app. I have been using it for a long time. I would just like to suggest that there should be an option to select a few songs at once to add to a playlist. Sometimes it is a bit frustrating to choose songs individually.,positive
If there is a way to sort downloaded songs by artist that would catch you guys up with 15 year old music players. Also can you manage to show album art properly for a whole week straight?

I love Spotify I use it all the time it bring so much joy into my life,positive
"With each Update it gets worst, Sometimes the search bar doesn't appear, Sometimes search does not load, Sometimes the music plays but there is no bar indication...",negative
"it was phenomenal, always suggested the songs I prefer, perfect quality, although without Spotify premium, it's pretty annoying getting ads and not being able to play the songs I want too",positive
Great variety of music!,positive
"Really good to use, I've been using Spotify a lot in the last 2½ years, Haven't had any issues with it (besides losing signal every now and then when in the car - as a passenger)",positive
"Keeps pausing on it's own every couple of seconds for no god damn reason. If I could just scroll from the top of my screen and press the play button I wouldn't mind, but I have to enter the app again to press play just for it to pause again.",negative
Awesome app but too many adds 😒,positive
"Works fine on mobile, if I'm on WiFi no matter which one it just won't load anything, I tried everything, the app has all permissions, still nothing!",negative
Overall it is good but the only problem is that the ads. They just take to long for it to play the next song you want to play like 3-4 ads will happen in between of you listening to what you want to listen.,negative
"won't let me play songs I want, and also shuffles songs when I want a specific song ALSO ALSO IT ""ADDS MUSIC I MIGHT LIKE"" I HATE IT, WHY CANT I HAVE JUST A FEW SONGS THAT I WANT",negative
"The service itself is great but the mobile app is infintely annoying. Most frequently I just listen to my ""Liked Songs"" playlist. I choose a song to listen to in the car then close the app when I get out. Anyone with a brain would think I'd want to continue listening from where I left off, right? So why is it that when I reopen the app, even if it's only been closed for a minute, my playlist has jumped ahead by about 100 songs? This is incredibly irritating. I would give 5 stars if not for this.",positive
Amazing app for those who love music 🎶.... But sometimes there will be some glitches... But not all the time 😉... If u r reading reviews to download this app then just go and download this application ☺️👍.,positive
Best place to listen to music too!!,positive
Good content for podcast.,positive
"3 stars until I see an update to fix this issue. I love this app, I've been a paid subscriber for years, but for the love of God if I have ""unedited"" songs in my liked songs, Do Not! Switch them out for edited versions!...I'm 30 years old and if I wanted to hear the edited version of ""gin and juice"" I probably wouldn't be listening to r & b in the first place, please fix this has happened to me so many times!",neutral
Excellent 👌... Good for burning calories....,positive
I can't turn off shuffle I don't have the icon,negative
I've had Spotify for about 5 years now and I'm a premium user I love the sound quality and the music they put on here the only problem which is why I'm give 4 stars is that it keeps glitching when I'm skipping songs it will either not play or keep going to the song previous or just skip 3 songs over other then that great app,positive
App is amazing but after the recent update I'm unable to login to my profile. App won't open it gets stuck at the launch doesn't show any fields for email address and password. Hope they fix the bug ASAP,negative
This app is worth its keep. Have enjoyed it so far. Hope they can improve on the sound output.,positive
"It's fun and free, but because of the auto shuffle I can't listen to a single song, even recommended songs I have to wait and listen to 5 other songs just to listen to a song I might not even like.",negative
Very useful and enjoyable app.,positive
"I was once a deezer user but when i tried this app, I have been so addicted to music",positive
"Spotify is great, I love it",positive
"Worked fantastic on mobile until recent update. It will take a short time to load (usually seamless), but then the controls do not appear after selecting a song. Don't know if that has to do with an ad that always plays? Can't see which one, no controls or album/ad view. After a few songs it will cut off. This time it crashed after 2 songs. Addendum: same issue with podcasts, even if an advert doesn't play first--no controls, cuts off unexpectedly. Happens on WiFi or cell data",negative
"Hey, can you give us an option to just randomly play a song, either from any of the playlists or from your suggestions for me or any random song and not just the last played song, from the home page upon app load? More like the Surprise me option in Netflix?",positive
Very Good Music App,positive
Brilliant especially on Bluetooth,positive
"the app is pretty ok but the newish design changes are annoying and intrusive. I just want all MY playlists in one place which doesn't need me to add filters or whatever. adding and removing songs is a chore and in general there seems to be a tendency to adding unnecessary and ugly buttons everywhere. Also, why is the basic menu laggy? do we need WiFi constantly to just pull up the tab to add or remove from playlist. The recommendations and compilation albums etc are very good though.",neutral
Best music experience ever,positive
It adds songs that I don't want hear!,negative
"I can't use my spotify, I don't know what happened.",negative
Any options left for students who cannot afford premium and have to deal with double unskippable ads?,negative
Perfect music app!,positive
"Usually love Spotify, but recently been having problems with it! After about 15 minutes of playing something it just cuts off, radio silence. When opening app, it takes a long time to respond, doesn't show you what you were listening to so end up having to find episode/song and play from beginning. The other day the whole app just wouldn't open at all?? Something has happened in the recent updates that has made it really buggy and laggy.",negative
Good music so many ads,positive
Great App. Really like it. Strongly recommended.,positive
Has all my favorite music!!,positive

Suppper app. when I upset.and tired Just i listen the song's in this app.my mind is fulllll happy.and I realised my tensions. Thank u. Spotify.,positive

Some songs are unplayable😒 Please introduce the light theme also🙂,neutral
"I used to love it because I could play my favorite tracks anytime. The ads were annoying yet bearable. However, recently, I haven't been able to even open the app. Whenever I try to open Spotify, it just kicks me out. Currently I'm using an alternative. I might leave a better review next time if this is fixed.",negative
When i share it in snapchat the thumbnail appears twice and the link appears only once with the image i can't delete that so please fix this problem asap,positive

WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE THING WHERE YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE MUSIC A BIT BEFORE PUTTING ON YOUR PLAYLIST,negative
"Completely different from the web version, good sound quality yet any playlist song Is completely random and you have 6 daily skips, can't get around it by playing single songs too. Overall the app is O.K. but the pc/computer web version is way better than the app.",negative
"App crashes constantly, the media bar disappears when playing music or podcasts and then I can't pause things, and the sound will randomly turn itself down while listing to music (not related to another notification appearing on the phone). This app is trash",negative
It's a super cool app you will get all songs you want Tho it has add but still working amazingly well when you have low range,positive
"Recently had started stopping randomly when screen is locked. Also the play bar at the bottom disappears a lot of the time so the only way for me to stop a song is to shut down the entire app and start again. Lots of glitches, not great.",negative
I totaly recommend you best music app ever its really worth it 😊😊😊😊😊,positive
Love this app it makes me feel better when se thing happened.,positive
I don't have any issues with this app at all really amazing,positive
Good if you have premium without it it's kinda trash,positive
"The App runs like a**. Every time I reopen it when I want to resume a podcast or song, der player disappears and the pages load for a minute or more. Every other app on my phone works fine.",negative
Spotify is nice app except I can't get into my playlist and it loads to slow .,neutral
I would say it was great 1yr ago but now it is the equivalent to apple music,negative
! It would be nice if one could sort the songs in one's own playlist manuel or after genres. -Sometimes I have the feeling that the app is a little bit buggy or weird because sometimes it doesn't let me put songs in repeat. +But all in one it's a nice app.,positive
This is very good AAP . I like this AAP very much . There all type of songs . Thanku so much for this AAP .,positive
You need to fix this I can't choose my own music and I have family premium... Fix this please,positive
Good sound quality ❤️❤️,positive

This is amazing. I really like it💜💜 #spotify💜💜,positive
Spotify needs some help after using for a few weeks it previewed only I mean the song stops after 10 secs I tried really hard 😅 but it was broken,negative
"I keep wanting to use this app for podcast and everytime I get discouraged. This time, I'm listening to podcast fine but I cannot pause it at all. The control to see what I'm playing is not there. Only way to stop it is to force stop it. I'll try again at some point but it's pretty unusable for me. Also, the controls don't translate to my car when I connect over Bluetooth. I'll update when these aren't issues.",negative
"I love Spotify, especially how it suggests other songs when I'm editing a playlist.",positive
"why won't it let me in? it's been like this for two days, fix it.",negative
"Would not open no matter what I tried, spent about 2 hours trying to fix it. :( It was pretty good when it did work.",neutral
"It sure has improved a lot compared to the earlier days, however I would love to see a better pricing policy for me to opt in and avoid the adds.",positive
"Compared to the desktop app, this app is terrible. Bugs everywhere, too many extra ""features"" being added while the core functionality gets worse. For example regularly the play/stop buttons just simply disappear. Only way to stop the audio is forcing closing the app. This doesn't happen on other audio apps. ""Offline mode"" doesn't work, you could download something and get on a plane and the file won't play.",negative
You can find amazing songs!You can find ur favourite artist,positive
"Please fix the dozens of bugs. Shocking experience. Now playing bar doesn't appear, podcasts won't play despite being fine on desktop. Had to uninstall and redownload, lost all my downloaded songs and files. I live in a bad signal area so rely on downloads when not on WiFi. For a market leader it's absolutely ridiculous.",negative

Everything is good I really like this app But there's one thing Why isn't canvas available in Nepal ?? Please make sure canvas is available in Nepal too.,positive
I really love this app I literally use it everyday and have a subscription however. For some reason it stops playing all the time it will be playing fine for 20 mins then all the sudden it stops playing and when I try to press play it won't so I have to close the app completely and go back just to turn it back on.,neutral
Wonderful app! You can play music offline even without premium. The only problem is that there are too many ads.,positive
Great songs from this app.,positive
I know a lot of apps do this now. But Spotify happens to be the one that did it recently. it's really really annoying to have my phone go off every single day when Spotify failed to get payment.,positive
Had no probs for so many years in my Android phone but now idk why but my Spotify doesn't lauch its always hanged on a black screen.,neutral
"I have been experiencing a sudden stop to what am I listening. Several times in the same podcast for example. Also, lately there is an error and I can't see anymore the buttons.

"Excellent app. Love the music variety to listen to. Not having app issues.👍👍👍 *(edit) this last update is bad, I need to hear 3 ads before I GET a chance to hear a random song, yeah you heard it right (a random song) because it doesn't let me listen the one I want, if I am lucky I can listen to that song after 6 skips. It shuffles the songs. Total stars goes down to 2 🌟.*",negative
"Good appp for music listeners. However, please stop adding other kinds of music in my playlist. It's not a good option...",neutral
Awesome great for downloading tracks and albums would totally recommend for all ages. Just think it uses too much space. Recently it has been occasionally crashing or stopping music. But other then that its a great app.,positive

"App frequently clears my queue with no warning, repeats the same song 10+ times, breaks my playlists",negative
Love Spotify soo much I love music so that makes sense but I can't afford to have premium so if u want to play whatever song u want without worrying about your skips have Spotify on a tablet or I pad and u can just pick what song u want out of your play list if that makes sense,positive
"Songs clarity superb, good app to hear all journals of music.",positive
"Urgent Requirement! ⚠️ You must add the ""download music option"" in tha application. Although downloads remain close inside the application. But it should me in free mode.",neutral

Very nice music experience thanku for Spotify,positive

Absolutely horrible every update it's even harder to get the song you want to play I installed it just so I don't have to install songs and I don't want to pay just to listen to the song that I want to :(,negative
The app is super awesome... i got no complains... I'm so so happy... Some songs don't have lyrics i think they have to sort that out but so far so good👍🏾,positive
Spotify is really great. I love the sound quality and the way it creates playlists for you is crazy. I only listen to Spotify songs and it's so AMAZING!!!,positive

Great app for music,positive
I hate this app because of the extra songs part when I listen to my songs songs I don't know pop up and it's irritating,negative
More and more if u buy premium and if it's end u more ads,negative

This app gets really annoying when I try open it it never actually opens properly and it takes me an hour just to open it don't recommend,negative
"Used to be a great app. But now if you're a Samsung Galaxy user there is no more visible player. Which means you can't pause, start, stop, skip or go back a track. It also now crashes regularly. I've been a premium user without these issues for years, but now it is hardly worth the subscription. It would be useful if Spotify could rectify these issues enabling the user to have some sort of listener control. Update: it had been fixed but now the same issue is happening again in July 2022.",negative
"It's a very nice app, specifically for music but there's only one catch that the ads are so annoying",neutral
Why don't you just play ads instead of songs?,negative

I enjoy Spotify and have been using it for quite a while. My only gripe with it is that when listing to an artists mix I wish they played more of the artist and less of the similar artists.,positive

"This app has major link and playback issues. I use it on android OS12. Firstly, you cannot play a direct song that is shared to you via social media. When you press the green play button to the bottom right of the song title the app simply ignores it and plays whatever it wants from random artists. If you enter your savedplaylist the same thing happens. This is very biased copyright playback since the specific artists on spotify cannot get there own music played per share. Fix it.",negative
I Really Love Spotify But app it's not working please fix it,negative
"Whenever I start a radio based off a song or artist (which is with the intention to find a NEW artist or NEW music that is related to the song/artist I'm starting the radio off of) it just creates essentially a playlist of music I've been listening to - and not even within the same genre off the song. I've realized that I haven't found any new artists or any new music, and just continuously listen to the same things over and over again which is quite depressing.",negative

Plays songs you don't want to play. (yes premium exists but listening to a song you didn't even click on is crazy),negative
"This is the best music platform, I admit to that especially when the user subscribes to it. But certain problems I'm not so happy with is that it doesn't refresh and show recently released hits. I'll have to see them in other apps them download them on Spotify or follow the artist. I'll still give it a complete rating, 'cause the updates lately are good. It'd be satisfactory if I hear an artist dropped a track and I see it quickly on the home page. Please work on this. It'd be acknowledged",positive
"No Auto Artist and Album List. It is should be all about the songs. If I like the song, the artist and album should be generated into an auto list.",neutral
I was happy with the app because it holds all the artists I like with very few gaps. Until I bought Bluetooth phones and discovered that it constantly stutters audio playback - the only app to do so. There's a very long discussion thread on the Spotify community going back to April 2017 with a multitude of other users who never found a solution. Some resorted to the competition because the company clearly doesn't care. I'm also considering that.,negative
"It's a nice music app but then when I play a song from a playlist, it plays a suggested song, which I find annoying. I just want to listen to the songs I added in the playlist, not the suggested songs.",neutral
"Upd: watch your language Spotify and don't command me like that: ""Update your payment methods NOW!"". I won't update anything if I don't want to. I'm tired that I can't add to blacklist ONE specific track from recommendations/radios. I block it every day and Spotify continues to add it in my auto generated playlists. It's hard to reorder playlist in Android app.",negative

It's awesome it just sucks that u have to pay for it,positive
I love this app but the new update is annoying. I know that's on purpose to make us buy premium. Giving us ads is enough. Not allowing us to choose or change the music and making shuffle disabled for us is annoying. I'll still give it a 4/5 cause I've been using this app for years already but I just haven't bought the premium.,positive

"I've been using for 5 years , it's awesome , it's an app that I use daily, I've been using premium for a long time and I have absolutely no regrets , money well spent .",positive
It's really ok and impacting but not all needed are available on Spotify.,positive
Spotify is also a good application when there is internet and not good when it is offline,positive
The pause play bar has gone missing! Please can this be looked at. Perhaps something weird in the last update?,positive
Had this since 2014. I just HATE that the shuffle songs repeat. It's shuffled but in the same pattern every time,positive
I would have given them a 5 only if they made us able to back up or transfer the downloads,positive
"I really liked this application and I advise everyone to download it, but the only problem is when I want to listen to songs without the Internet, I can not, but the application is still very good 😍♥️♥️",positive

"Terrible just wants money.... been paying for premium for a year almost and now that I haven't payed they won't even let me in the app to select what Playlist I'm listening to, just give me 2 options 1) pay em or 2) cancel which I don't wanna do as my dad is in charge of our duo account. TERRIBLE STREAMING SERVICE!!!!",negative
I love this app so much I have no problems with it,positive
Basic features such as playing things in order are unavailable without paying,negative
Wonderful! Keeps me upbeat when I need it,positive
After getting the premium my life became to ease up a bit and I thank spotify 🙏🏾,positive
It is very good app but it's new update is very very bad I am deleting this app 😈😈😈😈,negative
"Used to be amazing, have been a premium subscriber for 3 + years. The latest update causes Spotify not to show the song playing so I can't skip etc. Will stop at random intervals so have to manually open phone again. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, problem still persists.",neutral
I wish I had premium but otherwise great experience,positive
So it's great but I sort of miss Pand÷/ra. Spotify is awesome; however it's not life I've ever been to Vietnam. I got phished! Be careful.,positive
Very irritating. I want to stream music over mobile data and says no internet connection seriously....... Furthermore i am a premium user but still suffer. Please check on that as soon as you can.,negative
"Spotify is literally the worst platform you could use to listen to podcasts. They insert ads that aren't associated with the podcast makers and it makes podcasts sound disjointed. Premium doesn't even help in that regard. Some podcast episodes are also missing random 20 second snippets of audio, which aren't missing on other platforms so this is on Spotify's end. Most likely some kind of bug related to the aforementioned ads inserted into episodes by Spotify themselves.",negative
"The app sound is amazing,i using some time",positive
Spotify are tha best any music you have all thanks,positive
"Best app to listen to your favourite music anytime ,anywhere.",positive
Why don't you guys add a minus one feature for every song. Like a karaoke. Since you already have lyrics on some songs.,neutral
Auto play random songs. It is non sense frustrating. I have set auto play off and it still skip and plays random stuff. Utter garbage. Good quality in song is not answer to the random song recommendation.,negative

"July 6th, 2022. Just came back to Spotify today around 03:37, I'm not amused on how the Audio Devices I'm using currently onto Bluetooth and AUX Cable too, I used to have a quite different experience than a lower mono-audio about now. By the way; the sound was needed to be up around 94% oye. Ad's are fine but gives you 30 minutes of listing to music; But other devices that I use this app isn't the same, I only use shuffle mode.",negative
Too much advertisement .. too much disturbing ...,negative
Awesome reference to my favorite tunes,positive

Spotify is wow I love it and I will recommend people to use it,positive
"Best ever music app i ever experienced is spotify. Never witnessed any song unavailable and that's the best thing about it. But still , in offline music(without premium) ,it include lot of ads which can be considered as "" excess"".",positive
I love this app so much I love the music and everything about it. The podcats I really enjoy it's really interesting.,positive
"Worst app ever. They give songs between ads, I mean how can they even put songs between the ads , it just ruins the joyful exprience of listening to the ads. If they remove the songs I will definitely give them 5 stars.",negative

Mind blowing app so easy to use and it's amazing 😉❤️,positive
"The only place where I can get both music and podcasts. Great! I would not live without it. The only reason I do not have premium anymore is that I have got another music streaming service through my phone subscribtion - if I had not, I would definitely still subscribe to Spotify. Edit: have you considered adding ratings to your podcasts/songs? That would be nice.",positive
All those months it not work and they have not fix this issue if I play A song it will randomly play a random song please fix this again and the next update ok manager and developer 😤,negative

I only just resubscribed 3 weeks ago 😞",neutral
This is truely the best music app I have ever used and I've tried a lot of them. I love my music and this app has all the music. From the golden oldies to the latest.,positive

The only god thing is that you can share instagram stories with that pretty lyric thing and that's it,negative
Crashing and closing all the time,negative
Too much ads 🥲🥲🥲,negative
"Been going downhill for years (the UI to find anything is terrible, sound quality is average and when you download something it favourites it?!) but the way it struggles without an Internet connection is infuriating, it just shows a loading screen all the time, even for albums I've downloaded. I've downloaded them because I'm travelling and I know my connection is going to be bad so why am I staring at a loading screen",negative
It's good but Why can I not play the song I want to play. It always plays a different song than I'm picking. And 6 skips per hour? That's stupid,negative
"Well I gave it a four star rating because when I play a song it just keeps on playing the song in my playlist and I can remove the song when I fully exit the app,so it's pretty annoying. Other than that,I really like everything else just besides the annoying part.so it's a pretty good app to me",positive
"Never a boring moment with Spotify,search it you will find it😊",positive
I've been using this app for years but recently Somethings up with the app please fix it. Sometimes the music just starts playing but there is no way to stop it. I can't get the album cover of song I'm listening up. There has been other issues are a recent thing. Please fix it,neutral
"they were unexceptionally smart to give me spotify premium free for 3 months... after that 3 months i couldn't bear with the ads and i literally became a premium member for good. its the best music streaming app but fyou for taking my money by playing mind games. jk just buy premium duo with a friend, its affordable.",positive
Can't open the app anymore,negative
Very interesting app for music lovers,positive
Great! Only problem is that sometimes it can glitch out a bit but it doesn't do that often,positive
Fantastic music from top stars always available.,positive

Awesome app 👌 no ads,positive
Best choice for listening music,positive
what does it mean First you say listen 30 minutes of uninterrupted music then after one song you advertise again It would be better if you don't say it that 30 minutes of uninterrupted music,negative
It would be nice if we can download music and listen offline,positive
"The mobile version is absolute thrash I can't even choose the song to play, i can only choose a playlist with full of songs that i don't like.",negative
This app is great. It has all of my favorite music in one playlist!!! 🕺,positive
"The shuffle button isn't on all Playlist. Music stops after 10 secs even after going into the app. Also, I thought if I had the premium duo plan then it would get rid of ads. Why do ads still come up on podcast?? UPDAT: we are now in a July and it's still happening.. remind me why I pay for this sub???? First review was from back in April 2022. Maybe if the music wouldn't keep stopping randomly it would make more sense.",negative
"What is going on with all the bugs? Spotiy has always been wonderful until the last few months. Bugs, skips, doesn't pop up what im currently listening to, so I can't pause or stop the music without having to close the app. I'm really hoping this gets fixed and I dont have to cancel my subscription ☹️",negative

"unusable, songs will not even play and the app crashes constantly",negative
Very nice app to listen to your favorite artist,negative
"Spotify is great except two things. #1, It would be so much funner if it notified you when people followed you or notifed others when you follow them, I'm following countless friends who have no idea. It could be so much better. And #2, if you don't pay you lose access to listening to your Playlists, YouTube music still let's you listen to your Playlists when you don't pay, the only difference is having ads or not having ads. I hate that Spotify cuts you off.",positive
App works great. Many features.,positive
"Now playlist only can be played, but didnt show the list so i cant skip any song i want to hear. Sometimes i want to hear song i like in the playlist multiple time.",negative

Had Spotify for around 10 years planning on going another 10.,positive
"its a good app, good music, but the new update is horrible. Why do i have to shuffle my liked songs just to listen to music? why cant i tap on the song to listen to the full song and not a sample of the song? it doesn't really make sense but it does what its supposed to do which is play music. Also the ads make me feel like i have malware on my phone with it popping up randomly.",neutral
Great choices of music and seem to be for Free Speech so you get 5* from me boo,positive
Stopps playing playlists after just a few minutes,negative
I am fine without needing to pay for music so I get ads but I hate everything else. I should not need to pay to see what songs are in a album Suggested songs should be optional and skips do not reset at all i have not opened spotify in 5 days so HOW DO I HAVE NO SKIPS They have fixed all this so ya use spotify,positive
"Love it, this app is great for creating playlists and finding the music you love. I also Love the ability to download playlists for when you have no internet.",positive
"New UI with the play button in the left most just feels weird, please fix it to the standard button layout.",positive
Its better to pirate musics than using this... no youtube is better.,negative
"In first time, this app is disatified for me. I try to creat account but always reply to me something wrong. Free Log in,Log in with facebook, Log in with google account like that show me but can't sing in. What a uselsss app.",negative
The app is great don't get me wrong the only problem is the only way to enjoy it is that you have to pay a to repeat the music you have to pay. it does give you a free trial Without entering any credit card info. but I just don't like that I have to spend money to To do anything great in the app And it also doesn't tell you when the subscription is up. but l can just go on another app and listen to it completely free and offline without paying A single penny,positive
Im stuck at loading screen,negative
I have never been happier with a music provider. i Tuned out after 10 years and literally thousands of dollars. It will take me the rest of my life of ALL available music to make up for it.,positive

This is a grate app for music streaming.,positive
Used to like it but now you have to pay for basic fetures. You are forced to listen to random songs even if your trying to listen to one song. Its annoying.,negative
The computer version is way better,negative
In my opinion spotify beats all of the music apps out there hands down.........,positive
Removed features being used by the client base without any notice. Rather go to YouTube music then continue paying Spotify money. Bring back Spotify connect function and I'll take my review back.,negative
"The Reason for less stars is the ads are becoming irritating. This app used to be having a non interrupting playback for 30 minutes or so if you saw an ad between. But now it have ads after almost every songs. And it used to have an option for checking the song by giving a 10 second or so sample of it before adding the song to a playlist if you add the songs by ""Add Songs"" option in the playlist. Now it doesn't work. Please bring it back. And Please Allow us to rearrange the songs in a playlist",negative
I don't know I if it's just me but every time I play my LIKE songs it will play but later I will play song that I never liked or is interested in 😬😬,negative

It a good app BUT how can I not pick the songs I want to play and only get 6 SKIPS AN HOUR it's so annoying why can't I pick my own songs. So after 6 skips your stuck listening to songs I don't want to listen to at the moment why can't I pick the song like on every other device,negative
Too much ads 😔😔😔,neutral

Edit: now, when ever i try to look at a new song or playlist, it gives me infinite adds. Wost music app ever. Uninstall and move to youtube people.",negative
I pick a song it will change into random music,negative
too much ads. don't tell me to switch to premium. don't have a card for it.,negative
Great app when it works. I've tried multiple times to get it to stop playing in the background to no avail. Next option is to just delete it and cancel subscription.,negative
App is hot garbage and has been for years. I pay for the service and am plagued by crashes and random stoppages. Persistent notification for playback will break for no reason. Downloads will corrupt and leave you with no offline music.,negative
Spotify is the best app for listening music it has all the features I have never seen before 😄😄✌️,positive

It's a good app but there are few things bad with it it has a 6 hour wait to it when u skip like 4.

All good. I've been with them for years . One time couldn't pay my bill on time. And they paid for 2 months. Do I half to say anymore. Thank u. . J bird.,positive

Would be great but the 5 30 second ads kinda ruin it,positive
"What the heck is going on with this app? It was great and now it skips and when I open the app to turn off what I'm listening to, the player at the bottom has disappeared and I can't turn it off without closing the app. Restarting the phone and the app only helps temporarily. Reinstalling the app only works temporarily. I have loved Spotify but am considering switching to Amazon Music because of this nonsense.",negative
This app is the best way to listen to music,positive
"Great app I've been using it for years and have paid for my subscription. For the last few days there is no way to stop, skip or fast forward the songs. I have to close the entire window to get music to stop playing. Please fix.",positive
"Spotify app on PC is great, you can't doubt that. Although the moment you just wanna travel with music on a phone its so horrible, theres this bug possibly where you're locked on shuffle mode. You can't even have fun with music anymore because Spotify does everything possible to make it unfun.",negative
It's a good music app but I don't understand why I just cannot continue to skip freely from one track to another. Why restrict the number of times one can skip tracks while listening to a playlist.,neutral
Suddenly if u put songs in shuffle..the first song plays again and again Please do check this,neutral
The quality of music got worse when i got premium the transitions between songs slowed down and wouldn't load as fast,positive
"two days ago all songs from playlists i listened to were showed in the history of songs i listened to recently as just songs, i mean there weren’t any playlists and then songs from them, just songs. it confuses searching now, nothing has changed yet. i need answers, i have no idea what’s happening, and it extremely complicates using this app. upd: why can’t i download music lol? what now? nothing changed either.",negative
Great app! One problem! Stop politicizing the ads! I download it to listen to music not hear about LGBTQ or abortion or vaccines.,neutral
Can't open the app anymore. What the heck is going on?,negative
Great tunes and selection,positive
Been listening to Spotify for years. Never have been asked to rate it. Got a new phone and it wants to know what I think. If I didn't like it I'd be using another platform.,positive
"it's a wonderful music app, and i definitely recommend. however, one issue i have is the imbalance between the different platforms. pc, almost everything you want from the app besides ""no ads"". tablet, quality is kinda the same on PC, but different because it's a tablet. phone, god, it needs to improve. ads, sure whatever, i get it. but not being able to choose what song to listen to and only 6 skips an hour? what if someone can't afford a tablet or PC? rethink this, because it's stupidly unfair",positive
The recent update has rendered this the most annoying app on my phone. Constantly losing the playing bar. Used to work without issues. Huawei p30 Pro,negative

Really love playing spotify,positive
"Nvm, free spotify sucks",neutral
"Wow... I moved from ios to Android and the lack of care for Android is astonishing. I'm a software engineer and I would have been fired months ago if I released something this buggy and didn't even bother to fix it. This is not acceptable. It's not that it's buggy, it's that there is no care to fix it. Each new release makes the app more and more unstable. Probably priority is ios and Android just gets the crumbs.",negative
Best music streaming service I have ever used. UI is simple and sophisticated. Spotify also features many personalization options that makes the app feel like it was built for you.,positive
"I really don't care about the random pauses in the music. What upsets me is that after 14 days, everything is on shuffle. Like, you cannot pick a certain song on a playlist. Basically, it is forcing you to buy premium or else you will always be annoyed.",neutral
"The best ever music app after Google play store, with great quality sound n other effects. Specially the premium plan is so worth it. 👍😉😇",positive
Nice listening to wonderful music!,positive
"Don't use this app, don't give your money to Spotify. Switch to bandcamp and actually support artists and not be force fed platform exclusives daily or be bombarded with ads in your listening. Latest update appears to have completely borked the shuffle function, frequently goes over songs that were playing only minutes before.",negative
"Spotify is very greedy, as in the free plan it puts shuffle on and it can't be turned off at all, and so many other things like that are added so you have to get premium. Not worth it, get Pandora.",negative
"Can't listen to music, playlists for ALL are showing empty. Tried Uninstalling, clearing cache, rebooting...nothing has helped. I have a paid subscription and can't use the service. Update: Customer support was quick to address the issue and offered an easy solution to the problem. Thank you.",positive
"Well, what does this app offer that needs rating? It collects and plays the work of others well. Displays the artwork of others well. Its homepage is straight bad and mostly pushing things I will never and have never clicked on. They should have a ""simple"" mode that gets rid of all the faff and lets you just listen to music. After all, it doesn't pay its artists, so why does it need to advertise? I already pay for it!",neutral
It's a good app Just I don't like how I have to spend so much a month and only 6 skips pur hour it's should be six skips pur 30 minutes so when a add comes on we will get some skips,positive
It was nice and I loved to listen to music to drown out the noises or to draw but one day I was off to listen to music but it didn't let me choose music and I thought it was a glitch so I uninstalled the app the reinstalled it back but it still happened please put it to that we can choose the song and not randomize it,negative
"Why won't my Playlist restart? I keep starting my Podcast so I can draw stuff but then it'll start in the middle of a song and it'll completely throw off the mood, Why won't it restart the playlist instead of picking some random song to start in and then play that song and not let me to skip",neutral
"I pay for my monthly subscription and the same day it quits working. Tried uninstalling,, clearing data, clearing cache, restarting etc. Can't get past initial logo screen. So who's refunding my money????",negative

I really like it. Easy to use and customize.,positive

I love Spotify so much but I have two reasons why I don't like it. 1) I hate the ads. 2) premium is good but expensive and it made me broke,neutral
The only reason I returned to this God awful app is to watch jre. Although I haven't been able to in over a year because their mobile app is so poorly made I'll end up waiting five minutes for something to load just for it to buffer every twenty seconds without fail. Beyond frustrating to use even without the ads. I couldn't recommend this app any less and I personally believe an honest to God 8-track would be an improvement to whatever the hell Spotify claims to be.,negative
Easy to use and very popular so it has a wide selection of music,positive

I mostly use the app for exclusive podcasts like JRE and appreciate Spotify as company as a whole but the app crashes all the time. Frequently when I go to listen to a podcast the podcast doesn't come up so if it has video I can't see it or skip ahead or go back within the podcast its as if the app doesn't register its playing. If the app was more reliable I would like consider using it for music and upgrade to premium account but the frustration isn't worth it.,negative
sptify is a nice app . but it dosent let us enjoy the music. Ads every second and only 5skips a day! its forcing the user to pay. and thats lame .pls let some freedom for the useres so they dont hate this app.,negative

"I've been using this app for 4 years,but the new update is getting on my nerves.If you want to listen to a song you can't listen to it first if you even wanted to, instead it puts the songs in a order where you can't choose which one you wanna listen to first. Not only that, but when I tap on a song to listen to it instead of showing the play button it shows other songs and not the one I wanted to listen to. It is also frustrating when I wanna play a song on my playlist.",negative

You need to fix this.",negative
"Really knows how to setup the music, great system 👍",positive
"The app has such a variety of music and gives new artist so you dont get bored of your favorite artist, however despite the apps quality the add situation is a little abnocious having to pay a fair price with no adds and offline music is a fair deal still the adds should depend on how many months/years your account was created so the longer you have uour account the less adds.",positive
This app is so annoying....after the last update all playlist has under go on shuffle mood and you cant disable it without buy a premium...... and you cant change song over 6 time..... this is so disappointing..... I am going to uninstall this app,negative

Spotify is okay but I can't loop it or choose my song. YouTube let's me do that. I can do that on my computer Spotify but not mobile. It sucks.,neutral
Too many ads like gawd I know I have to pay for premium you don't need to give me three 30 seconds long ads continuously Even once is enough,positive
Since I updated the app won't open.,negative
I love the app and the premium prices are reasonable. The only problem I have is that it's a bit tedious adding songs to a playlist.,positive

Not having 30 minutes of commercial listening.,negative
Forget this. Im going back to Youtube. At least there i can listen to the songs i want instead of my 30 ad free minutes being recommendeds of what i listened to last week. 10/10 do not recommend this app. Alot of problems built into the app on purpose just to pressure people into buying their premium. Premium in their case being a decent app that just lets you listen to your music which i shoukd get anyway. Total ripoff,negative
Whenever I try to play songs it just plays a random song. Unusable.,negative
I try to play the song on my Play list and Play songs I didn't add,negative

Currently the play bar is disappearing from the bottom of the app constantly. Extremely frustrating and yet marked as resolved according to their website. Will be leaving 1 star review until this is fixed properly because it's a core feature that should never be broken (for an extended period of time at that) in a music app.,negative
Great music definitely a great app to have.,positive
Very good app for music and podcast. But ads are too frequent.,positive
I love the selection of music. Oldies that I knew my granny loved that I couldn't find elsewhere.,positive
Any other Android users having issues with the app? I've read alot of us are experiencing the same issue after updating the app..once it's updated and you try to reopen it stays stuck on the logo....its trying to load up but never does! Extremely frustrating when you can't speak to a human. All Bots when trying to resolve the issue! Back to Pandora I go!😭😭😭💔💔💔,negative
I love Spotify!! I have ALWAYS been able to find every song I'm looking for and every podcast too. Paying for premium is 100% worth it. Spotify is THE BEST app and I choose it over all the others out there. Thanks for being amazing Spotify 👍😁.,positive
"Was terrible, couldn't stand using the app with ads and limited skips... then I got premium. Now, all I ever use is Spotify. No ads, no taking up phone space, and pretty much all the music I listen to. Sometimes I have an itch for a song that isn't available on Spotify, so I just YouTube it and carry on with my day. The only subscription I won't be getting rid of any time soon :D",positive

Performance is very poor When i search for music and I tap the play button it play different much,negative
"Great desktop version, free version on app is obviously worse. You get what you (don't) pay for I guess. Appreciate that ads are needed but there seem to be significantly more. That's a minor whinge. The fact the app throws random songs into your playlists is extremely annoying.",negative
Changing my review from 1 star for the free version. I just got a student subscription and the app works super fast. I am able to listen to songs in different languages (a lot of them with lyrics). The playlists are also useful as I can discover new songs. Spotify has got to be the best music player in the world right now. :),positive
Spotify was good untill they started the 8 ads in a row deal,negative

I don't know why or when exactly the problem started, but almost every song skips like a bad record and I haven't found a single effective solution. reinstalling, reporting the bug, opening and closing ect ect. I love this app and I would hate to lose it, but this issue is incredibly frustrating.",negative
New update is horrible. Not being able to pick which song and my playlist constantly shuffling. I recommend SoundCloud or YouTube Music.,negative

Great music selection..,positive
Voice is very clear and good,neutral
"App constantly plays the same songs regardless of using shuffle. For example, today while not driving the app is playing all the songs it played yesterday while driving. Sucks.",negative
"I will never pay for Spotify. It's a scam. Literally every other song is an ad an then when I am able to catch a commercial free period, you guys ruin it. How do you let a 4 minute song go over 6 mins and had I not used one of your skips my whole 30 minutes would have been wasted on 1 song. It's absolutely ridiculous",negative
It plays every song I could ever imagine having to think of and it is very useful,positive
This is everything I needed thank you spotify,positive
Absolutely Stunning! More like they know my soul and give me what i want. 🖤,positive
"What is up with free Spotify. I get that I'm not going to get the best version of the app but you only have 6 skips. The 6 skips are that bad but pair it with when you play a playlist it just plays random songs that aren't even on your playlist. So you skip those song but then the app is like: ""woah slow down instead of skipping try editing your playlist?"" And you can't edit your playlist because it's playimg random songs. And when you search noooo it has to play more random songs.",negative
Use any other app. Constantly stops playing for no reason. Sometimes stopping after 5 minutes or less.,negative

Its a great app but.. Since the new update spotify is just no💀 you cant even play your fav song over and over why did you removed that in the app idk whos idea to put random songs in your playlist who EVER thought of that is a horrible idea,negative

"Every couple of months the app's 'fun' side rears it's ugly head. I'm talking the sound cutting out for no reason till you open the app again, downloaded files that are in the downloads folder not playing till you're back on wifi or turn your data back on and the app not showing on your device that anything is playing when it clearly is. As we speak, Spotify started playing again randomly after cutting out for 10 minutes. Thanks Spotify.",negative
Literally can't live without Spotify. By far the superior music experience in my opinion 🤷🏼‍♀️😅,positive
"Lol. Idk why did I bother to came here. The app doesn't work at all. It just show the logo, no matter how long I try to wait, and that's it. I can't even log in to my account. Tried to uninstall and reinstall for several times but it's just useless.",negative

Love Spotify.. My music go to..,positive
Very easy to use. Updated gebra of music.,positive
This is very good app to listen song and sing with that by reading lyrics.,positive
It is alright but as soon as the premium runs out it sucks because if you try to play a song you searched up you just get some other song instead of what you clicked on so basically you have to pay to listen to the music that you want also it now sometimes refuses to give me my six skips per hour because I used it yesterday and today used three skips and it said that I have used my six skips also not to mention it now gives me almost three ads in one ad and the thirty minutes don't work anymore,negative
Super super it's all no words Better than these app *gana app *Hangama * Jio savan Great work from Spotify .,positive
"Poor...30 seconds ads never felt like they last a long time till now. Especially when you're just trying to play music. I get that they need money...but bro...right in the middle of the Playlist? What's the point of listening your favorite song If an ads ruins your mood, hype and vybe just because you don't have premium.",negative
This app is a nice app for music and podcast and there are my favourite artist,positive
I think it is the worst app ever i have used. This app is showing ads after every 1 or 2 songs which is really a pathetic thing. I don't want to gibe even 1 star also but without it the review won't be posted.,negative
i cant open the app : ( tried installing-uninstalling the app multiple times already... still not responding,negative
New update... Why shuffle play button dissappear in liked songs? I want to get random music. There is only play/stop button and second button to loop playing. Please return it back!,positive
Best app for podcasts ....best suggestion.but the ads are annoying so Spotify make sure you reduce the amount of ads,positive

Tired of your ads 😑 uninstalling it😑,negative
Fantastic for music lovers.. On point!,positive

It's a great app but you can't really choose the song you want to play and if you run out of so g that your playlist randomized it just gives you random song that you might not even like and then pretty much forces you to buy premium,positive
So I was using Spotify for the last two years and now am having some issues. Whenever I get a message notification from WhatsApp then notification beep sound continues.

Great app and amazing wide variety of content. Ads are not too loud or frequent in free use. Price of premium is very fair and totally worth it!,positive
I think this app is great though the only thing i wish that it has was the loop the song forever although i think it is a premium function and it is alright i think it is a 4.5 around there. Definitely better than youtube music in all other parts though especially the ads experiece wow you can listen to a whole hour of spotify and hardly any advertisements would pop out,positive

I should have Given you 5 Star. But I rather give 3 star. Because Spotify is a excellent App. But the monthly payment is extremely expensive $9.99 .you guys should do like $5 .So to have many subscribers. e. g Am 37 years old and if I will be listening to music for about 20 to come. How much will it cost in twenty years of my living on this Earth?,neutral

Will pause songs randomly of you don't give the app permission to run 24/7 in thr background without restrictions on android. I do t want it starting or running in the background when I am not using it. It acts like I lost signal when using it if I have it as a sleeping app when not in using it.

Without the play / pause option, I cannot pause my podcast or music when someone comes to speak with me. Additionally, the app keeps playing despite receiving phone calls.",neutral
"Too many ads,not playing the correct song that i choose.",negative
Love it. Getting all my favorites.,positive
"Randomly skips my songs, won't let me pick specific songs in my playlist, literally missing basic functions you can find in 99% of other music players if you don't buy premium, they want to make it as mind numbing and painful to use their app as possible so you can give them money for something that others can give you for free! Atleast with youtube I can pick songs from my playlist to play without skipping through my playlist with shuffle.",negative
"Spotify rocks it, got kicked off YouTube for expressing my first amendment rights of free speech and don't miss communist Marxist YouTube at all, thanks Spotify!!!!",positive

Full package when it comes to music,positive
"Love it been using it for a while, the liked song play list is awesome though I massively wish there'd be a 'relaxing' genre tab for sorting if it does that in the future I'll easily give it 10 stars",positive
Poor user interface. You have to wait >10s for albums to load even when offline. Why does the app keep trying to connect when in offline mode and phone airplane mode??,negative
"App is great! They should tell you though that after an update you should restart your phone, you know, just like your computer so your update can take effect!",positive
I shuffle thousands of songs and it's always the same 10 scattered at the beginning.,neutral
This is the best app for song's,positive
"Very buggy lately (July 2022). The app constantly bugs out, loosing the now playing bar and becoming unresponsive. The only way to stop play back is to force stop the app.",negative
"Pretty good other than the queue option. When you want to go to the previous queued track, the queue gets lost for some reason and it plays a different song?!",positive
"Spotify has gotten extremely buggy in the last year or so. I will sometimes get redirected to a playlist radio when I try to shuffle play a playlist, and once in a while it pauses what I'm listening to and the now playing bar in the app and the control widget on my notification screen disappear. I've been a premium member for years and hope these problems get fixed soon, but it looks like they've been known issues for a while.",neutral
Way too many ads at this point I listen to more ads than music,negative
Nice app for music i can enjoy listening cuz most of the songs are available. But it will be great if lyrics were romanized cuz its difficult to sing along as an international kpop stan,positive
Nice app all music,positive

Great music collection,positive
"Extremely infuriating, I pay for Premium and Spotify wont even let me play the songs in MY playlist without playing a random ""recommended"" one, and there is no solution for this, and if there is they have done an incredible job of making the UI as confusing, cluttered and unnavigatable as possible. Unsubscribed, am now using a competitor, which is a lot better, for free.",negative
"Really good, only problem is the advising it does if u don't have Spotify premium, other than that a 5/5",positive
"Overall, Spotify is a great app. But, as someone who has trouble falling asleep and likes to meditate, it would be great if the sleep timer could be set for more than an hour. - Suggesting a 2 and 3 hour option to be included.",positive
"App is not working, it won't load... It only shows the Spotify symbol and it won't do nothing",negative
Excellent selection of music and user friendly,positive

App stopped working on Pixel 6 with latest update. Force closes instantly.,negative
"It's been a month of waiting, I'm still looking at my screen a logo of Spotify how nice isn't.",negative
What happened? Since July 4th the app won't work on my phone. It keeps stopping or shutting off completely and it won't play in the background. I used this app for sleeping and can't. There is also no way to skip or relisten to anything. Please fix! We pay premium and don't want to find another app for music and podcasts.,negative
We can pick make our fave playlist,positive
My play/pause options have disappeared. This is very annoying! Plus the app starts playing on my phone when I turn the car off. Which I can't stop because I don't have the control bar. Loved the app before this happened.,neutral
"Fix the shuffle ""always on issue"" I'm a paid member and doesn't even give me an option to unselect shuffle anymore. Frustrating doesn't even describe it.",negative
I can't open the app it only displays the logo. I tried clearing the data and cache but still doesn't work.,negative
"It's extremely annoying that I need an internet connection to view my ""downloaded"" content. That tells me that it isn't truly downloaded. In addition, the app will suddenly show that nothing is downloaded, and content is simply listed in my ""episodes."" Later, even though I haven't done anything and wasn't near wifi, it will show my content as ""downloaded"" again. Shouldn't the app actually download my selections to my phone?",negative
"It's good that you can use it for free and listen to playlists, also podcasts that you're into. The two issues I have are that sometimes (most times), I can't listen to the podcasts I've downloaded offline. Then the other is that you can't start a playlist from the beginning, a lot of the time you have to continue the playlist. I used to start another playlist then back again to start it from top but that has not worked in a while.",neutral
Makes me fall in love with music again!,positive
The play bar usually disapear even though I uninstalled and installed the app several times!! Please fix this.,negative
I really love to hear music on spotify 😘😘,positive

Great app to listening to all kinds of music without having to use YT and kill bandwidth,positive
"I used to really love this app, so I ended up going Premium. However, for a few months now there has been countless problems. Music or podcasts constantly pausing, the bar where you can skip or pause constantly disappearing. I've contacted Spotify and done everything they've asked, but nothing works. I think they need to admit there is a problem with the app that needs fixing.",negative
I've been using Spotify for quite some time already. And in general it's cool. But recently I started experience problems with playing songs and podcasts in offline mode. And in general I have an impression that app became more laggy. Hope this is temporary.,positive
I always find the music that I'm looking for.,positive

"SECURITY ISSUE. The accounta are not secure, avoid signing in with your email service if you cannot avoid using the app. Have been using it for almost a year to discover this. Your login information is NOT secure. Apart from that.. App is not upto the standard. Bells and whistles but no quality. Low quality customer support for a paid service. The audio is very low quality, also the support executives have zero clue about their own product.",negative

So I have the family pack which allows up to 6 devices and when I go to download my play list it says to many devices ( we only use 4) so I log everyone out and still same problem fix it Now or loose a long time subscriber,negative
"Has lyrics, integrates better with Chromecast than the Google music service - seamlessly changing from computer to phone to tv, even automatically when I put my earbuds in. I am amazed how well this works. 11/10, it's the little things that matter and it's clear the people making this care",positive
"App won't go to log in screen, just shows splash screen",negative

"I dont listen to music alot but spotify is pretty solid, but im still waiting for that one karaoke feature i saw on tiktok i dont know if thats real or not but ive already updated my spotify so yeah",positive
Latest update is rubbish. The app is not even working atm. First on my car ay. Now not on Android phone at all. Trying to reinstall the app. Get you stuff together I pay for a working app. Not this,negative
"Constamtly randomly pauses, or doesn't let you press play at all. Terrible for a paid for service",negative
Worst app I ever seen too much problems. My recommendation please do not download this app..,negative
First of all I had to make a new account because it wasn't giving the option for mobile login. Then now when I play a song on shuffle or normally after every skip it reaches the first song I played and it's frustrating seriously,negative
The best music app that I have used so far,positive

Sound is. So clear. Easy to use.,positive
"So far so good, I am loving the app. It makes collecting my Playlists easy",positive
"Finally Spotify have put in lyrics if available, such a long time.",positive
Good UI but too much ads. Mostly cringe ads.,positive
Had all my music saved to my sd card yet when Spotify updated I lost everything and it won't let me go back to sd card as it keeps trying to download to the phone. There is no problem with my sd card so I blame Spotify for stressing me out unable to use app now offline,negative
"Very easy to use, thanks 😊",positive
The song which I want to listen is not played.For example I want to play lut gaye from Jubin Nautiyal.Other song is played but not lut gaye.Very sad.,negative
Amazing i would say I'm not premium member but I didn't give it full 5 star because sometimes the ads are quite often to the point that there would ads after every song and other is that sometimes it just stops working it doesn't show me which song I'm playing so they fixed that i would rate it 5 star without being a premium member,positive
For those who are tired of the ads provide by Spotify. Just simply download Spotify from happy mod it's 100% safe and secure and it's exactly the same as the original version you will never get ads and you can also download your favourite songs 👊[thank me later ☺️],negative
"New update sucks, I hate the add to queue option when I press on a song. Just play the darn thing",negative
"So many problems with player, randomly stops, often doesn't show player etc",neutral
Great music listening experience. Would love an option to identify a song playing in the background.,positive
I hate it because when I play a song I couldn't hear anything and if I download a song it keeps kicking me out of the app,negative
It's a really nice app. Has almost all the songs which one could ever dream of. The only problem is too many ads. If maybe u could somehow reduce the amounts of ads for free listeners then that'll be great.👍,positive
Option of being able to just hide specific recommendation is just gone?!,negative
"App stuck on load screen, even after multiple uninstalls.",negative
"Extremely good quality music which gives justice to every music, whether it be jazz, rock, pop, classic etc and also DJ mixes. Very good correspondence",positive
Love spotify cause I'm able to make my music list and share it with my friends,positive
Too much of ads👎,neutral
Welcome to the ad app,negative
"It keeps randomly pausing podcasts, it's not allowing me to play a searched song, and pause/pause button often dissappears which means I have to close app and start again. And all this using the paid version.",negative
Too much Ads,neutral
If there is power cut and when light comes and you try to play some music it say no network connection,negative
It's Good App Cx it has no adds and we can make our own playlists as well it's pretty fun,positive
Well organised app but reason for 2 stars are 1.) Lots of ads after every 2 songs there's an ad 2.) Connected to wifi with avg speed of 10mbps still there's a network error so I have to close app and open again 2-3 times to try my luck,negative
For real bro... 6 skips an hour. Were putting limits on skips now how money hungry can you get,negative
Very nice to listen to music,positive
Horrible when you click on a song it doesn't play that song it plays a playlist and too make matter worse you can't even play specific songs on a playlist you created,negative
"Stupid app, borderline greedy. Forces use to use premium, or else you almost couldn't even listen to your album. Why the auto shuffle? No one needed that thing",negative
"I listen to it when i going to sleep, when im exersizin, and even when im playing games with myself.",positive
"can't really complain , except that sometimes it just stops playing music... this is honestly very irritating , i'm assuming it does this , because i don't a subscription but all in all , i highly recommend it , good quality music edit : I canceled my subscription 2 months ago because I couldn't deal with the double deductions every month. They still deduct money from my account and they are refusing to refund me my money. If you know what's good for you, you will download Apple Music.",negative
It's a good app but the ads are just annoying and I don't know why we get 6 skips per hour like why not just remove the feature and sometimes I'll be in a sad mood and then an ad will come on and will ruin the vibe And and then another add will come on but look it's a very good app but just lower the ads and remove the 6 skips per hour thing please?!?!,negative
"Since the new update, the ""now playing"" tab keeps disappearing and I can't even pause or click next track. After a while, the track stops. I have tried uninstall and install it again, but it keeps happening. Pls fix the bug, it's annoying.",negative
"The experience could be improved for offline mode. If I start playing a playlist that I downloaded already online, I'm unable to just continue playing it if I go offline. I must replay it from scratch, which is a problem if I was playing in shuffle mode. Please improve on that. Also, if a Spotify playlist is updated by just reshuffling tracks, songs don't need to be downloaded again if they've already been downloaded. Please find a way to just rearrange without downloading again.",positive
It helps me calm down and helps me play games longer,positive
Great sound tracks.,positive

I highly recommend getting premium,if I'm not mistaken a family package is around R99pm.It is amazing and I really enjoy Spotify and their music!",positive
Lately the app doeasn't show itself and I can't control it like pause or play or close it. Sometimes I restart the phone itself!,negative
Everything great other than the equalizer menu should be accessible on the homepage snd the app has some bad optimization or something because it opens super slow.,positive
A dreamy app to experience your life with more beats & melodies whenever you want... Just adds are intruption and remindes me how poor I am.... 😅,positive
I don't like how it's not working how it use to but it's an AMAZING app it's just I want to listen to a different song when a song is playing but it plays 10 seconds of the song I want to listen to,positive
Just keep stopping for no reason. Have to force close to get it working again. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️,negative
"Too many adds and more emphasis on buying premium , podcast Don't have adds soo good",positive
This app best from all music apps excellent app forever,positive
Queue related things have been bugging for many months. Songs randomly skipping and queue sometimes just wiping itself. Adding songs sometimes deletes other songs from queue. Really annoying as queuing is one of core functions.,negative
"Back then, this app was good and smooth. I've noticed some upsetting developments in the last several days. When I start opening my Spotify app, all I have seen is the logo. It's crashing and freezing at the same time. I've still thought of trying those Tutorials on youtube, but many of them didn't work.

So much add . and i don't have any interst of premium . please stop,positive
"Best app for music and new discoveries. The a.i. recommendations to similar artists/albums, is second to none, a must though is membership. But worth every penny if you are a fellow music fan. Would give 100 stars if I could; spotify has re-ignited my passion in listening to good, new (and old) music.",positive

"AVOID THIS APP!!! you are better off listening to song on YouTube. I uninstalled it 2 hours after I installed it. You can search for a song but when you try to play it Spotify decides you really should listen to another. I searched for Should Have Been a Cowboy, song not album.

"Been running into a bunch of bugs recently. The most annoying is that I can't add more than one thing to the queue. If I keep adding, it will just erase the previous addition and I have to restart my phone several times to get it to work.

I love the songs it has diffrent langigesit. Its... Perslfect,positive
The User Experience and UI of the mobile app is awful. Lots of missing features and functions such as sorting playlists are just hidden behind menu's and menu's and it's a very bad experience when compared to the desktop version.,negative

I think it's a good way to wake up listening to something instead of a clock going off every morning. And it helps connect with family and friends also helps u get in a good mood or if u wanna sing with someone this is the number one app I recommend.,positive
The app it's self isn't that bad great selection of music but the algorithm for Shuffle is horrible.,neutral
"It's an absolutely great app for listening to music, but only if you have time. This app is unreal if you don't have to wait for music, but if you have low service and a want to play your already downloaded music you're SOL, you're going to have to wait for service to play the music downloaded on your phone. This also applys if you're a service member without service overseas. You wont have access to your already downloaded to your phone music at all.",neutral
Years in and I still love it. Never a problem. So much easier than ANY other app. Love my music and they deliver. Thank you..,positive
Plays music but adds are quite annoying. How.many times does it need to tell you to use tide pods because they have less water than liquid detergents. Stupid adds between the songs. Uninstalled after three weeks.,negative
They just removed a latest marathi film songs album which I was frequently listening these days. The claim of 30 min music without ads after a long ad is not right.,neutral

Good apps i wanna give 5 star but using this app longer and longer the ads come every 2 song after and says 30 min uninterrupted ads but when we play 3 song or more ads come again.

"Rarely have I looked for anything - rare, live, obscure...- that I can't find.",positive
Very greatful app for song.. And also i request to you please add one feature also to identify any songs.. Especially it is very helpful to identity edited ringtone amd songs...

I hope you try to add a feature to identity musics&songs .. Really iam still enjoying your apps,positive

"Since my spotify got premium, my spotify was like possessed by a demon, it changed the song by itself, turns up the volume by itself, and annoys me by opening other pop up screens when I am typing, just like a cellphone screen that gets hit by water. It is not worth it at all.",negative
This is a excellent music app to listen to.,positive

In the beginning Spotify was good but now it is the worst I can't skip music when I search for a song it gives me a playlist wih the same name and it doesn't even contain the song I want and songs are not full when I play a song it gives a very very short part of it uh And honestly sound cloud ☁️ is better 😌,negative
No replay option!! You can only listen to music once!! Cheap app,negative
WHY THE HELL DOES THIS NEW UPDATE KEEP MAKING MY MUSIC PAUSE LIKE EVERY 20 SECONDS. ITS VERY ANNOYING!! I DO NOT PAY PREMIUM EVERY MONTH FOR THIS. PLEASE FIX BUG!!,positive
"I stopped subscribing because you had podcaster that ia an anti vaxxer spreading disinformation. If he is gone , I will come back.",negative
It's a pretty good app but i hate the update.,negative
Definitely the best. Recommended for many more music lovers.,positive
"Love this app. Whatever mood I am in, Spotify can satisfy my music craving. I just wish I knew how to stop my notifications from interrupting my songs.",positive
"Love this app, I only use this for my music streaming. I pay for premium for my family and both my mom and I have been experiencing weird pauses and skips. For example, sometimes when I let my phone screen time out while playing music and it goes dark it pauses, sometimes it will come back on its own and other times I have to restart the app. It pauses other times too. It's a minor inconvenience but very annoying.",neutral
Loving Spotify since 2015,positive
"You're always updating. Stop. Get it to where it works and don't touch it. Every time you guys update the are problems... or maybe, I don't know, DO IT RIGHT. App is stopping again for no reason. And no, I don't want to uninstall and download all my music again.",negative
The volume of music when using earphones is low but when the ads pop it will blow my ears and it has 2-3 ads in a row what waste of time I could just open my youtube app.,negative
This app doesn't let your critique anything; whether it be like racist or single minded podcasts like behind the bastards or necronomipod. I find it quite humorous that such a large business could be so reckless when so many of their podcast creators destroy lives without little to any evidence.,negative
"I can still access my playlists and play songs on the web browser, but through the mobile app, i cannot",negative
"Honestly love the app for release radar and unlimited music but I'm getting so frustrated that, for so long, random issues constantly arise. Adding a song to the queue replaces any songs in the queue, I'll have a queue and a new song I click will delete the queue, I'll click a new song and the queue will go to the next song instead of the song I just clicked, and out of nowhere after an hour or so spotify will just stop. I'm sorry, but if I'm paying, it's been months please fix these issues!",positive
"Love Spotify so much, only reason it doesn't have five stars is because there are so many ads. But, great quality and I love how I can find any song on here!!! <3",positive
It works perfectly fine before but starting yesterday it won't get pass the spotify logo sign for minutes then it would freeze and exit on its own. I'm missing my playlists already so please fix it!,neutral
Usually I use use spotify daily but recently there's been a glitch and it just shows the logo when I open it and it doesn't work. I've tried doing things to my device to try and help it but nothings working.,negative
I enjoy a mix of music with limited adds,positive
"For some reason still no access to lyrics unless I make a new account, which makes zero sense...",positive
Great app. Sometimes glitches and the controls don't work so I have to keep listening without skipping songs. Normally good though.,positive
"The new update sucks a fat one!! Pauses randomly, the player disappears and I can't pause/stop the music. Edit: after a couple of months, updates, re-installs, these issues are still happening. Very disappinting considering I have a pretty new high-powered Samsung galaxy.",neutral
"Jesus this is frustrating. Even though I force close this app several times, it immediately opens in my car and I can't get it to not connect. It is ridiculously frustrating. Borderline useless. I hope the engineers that worked on this get diarrhea and a cough for a week.",negative
I like it but the new update is trash and is makes me want to get rid of it please fix it,negative
"I mean I used to love spotify but now it literally plays an ad after every song. Not only this but it constantly exits the app and stops playing a song for no reason. It also skips songs on its own. It also plays those ads that supposedly gives you 30mins of ad free music if I watch it and when I do watch it, it starts playing ad after ad and it's annoying. I get you need to pay artists but the amount of ads played is ridiculous. Had to move to Apple music, can't use spotify no more.",negative
"Come on, its spotify, its the best music app out there",positive
Excellent listening experience. You can listen to music with the screen off.,positive
Like the plaY lists they set up for me based on the music I like.,positive
It's too good. All the songs I can ask for are available at one platform. I am loving it.,positive
Easy to use easy to enjoy with my devices!,positive
it's good but im begging yall to show what playlists a song are in. like for example after you click 'add to playlist' maybe have a mark next to the playlist name if the song is already in the playlist. it would make organizing so much easier and less time consuming please add it 😭😭,positive
It's pretty good one day I'll pay the fee but not today lol,positive
"Spotify suddenly logged out my acc out of nowhere and they wouldn't let me log in. It always says, ""SOMETHING WENT WRONG, TRY TO USE YOUR EMIAL INSTEAD"" but whenever I try to use my email, it always says ""THERE'S NO USER FOUND IN THIS EMAIL"" It's frustrating!!!! I just want my acc back???!?!?!???",negative
It's a good app but when I tried to play my own playlist I made it just starts playing random songs that I don't even like Spotify if you can make it an option to make it were the only songs in there are the ones we pick and not some random songs,negative
Spotify is one of the best choices for music that I can think of. I had premium for a year and that was really great cause I was able to make-up some fantastic playlists. And they don't erase them when you go back to free.,positive
Love it lots of great music choices,positive
I'm not able to open Spotify,negative
Definitely a great music an podcast app. Easy to navigate thru the app.,positive
I absolutely love Spotify!!!,positive
I hate how it adds more songs to a single song and you just wanted to listen to that one song and it adds songs to your playlists too.Also why can't you remove songs?,negative
"Love this app. Wish I could work for Spotify, bet it's a real blast. 😜 The only issue I have is the ads. Can't afford to go premium just yet !",positive
I love that I can see all my favorites and much more,positive
Bro when I connect my Alex to my phone click on a song it just doesn't play that song even when I am not connected to my Alex very bad aap,negative
Used to be Great but now is not. When apps misfunctions one must delete all content to reset. No customer support exists-- just advice from other users. So to get the value of my Premium Subscription I must uninstall to re-install dumping my 1k song library 😞😓😩 07/22 no change. Review remains valid,negative
Please if you would provide us with a video player It would be fantastic,positive
Great music love this app,positive
"5 stars, for the most of the times. Car mode could improve. Some songs are not there, but all in all... It rocks 😊",positive
Need to add option to redeem spotify card from app itself .currently I only see a credit card and paypal options .guess you guys dont seems to care .please add that option to the app or me personally I'm done .it shouldn't be hard to add that option to the app.,negative
Constantly crashes on my pixel 6. Has so many bugs where it plays music but I can't pause or stop it.,negative
"I love this app, it gives the listener a high quality of sound and it has great catalogue of music which caters for everyone's tastes. The plus with Spotify Pro you get the added bonus of no ads and get to download whatever song or album you like. Spotify also grows with you, it keeps track of all your music likes and Spotify gives you a more tailor-made experience. 10/10 ' love it.'",positive
"Great music app, however some great songs are unavailable. I know this may be out of the companies control but it does suck whenever I want to listen to a song only to find it is unavailable.",positive
Now ads bad app,negative
Why doesn't it want to show the songs,positive
Great can use a little work,positive
Nothing else needs to be said... Finding artist I am looking for!,positive
Great music selection easy interaction with app. Overall amazing expetience and premium with no ads...just great!,positive
Often times its deleting my dowloaded music even if im premium,positive
"Lot of bugs, One of them is when you remove (-) a song and press next(>) in playlist--- It skips next two songs and plays",neutral
Very good app but I know they want to have money but it is somewhat frustrating to wait 1 hour just to change the song if you have changed it 6 times besides you can't choose because you have to be premium for Not having to listen to other songs and only listen to the one you want,neutral
"It's an Amazing app it's the only music app I use other than youtube. The only thing is sometimes the ad that gives you 30 mins uninterrupted listening bugs, But it's no big deal",positive
Has anybody experienced the Mike Rowe's podcast freezing and not playing at all?.,positive
Reliable and loaded with the music I like,positive
"Excellent choices and variety, a go to for any music enthusiasts",positive
"Even without premium I can still enjoy my music, it's a very very nice and enjoyable app.",positive
"I really love Spotify, but I recently moved to Apple music because of payment issues. I wish you guys will support Google pay for payments.",neutral
"I still have Spotify, and the songs are great, but the reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because there wasn't very many ads before, and now there are SEVERAL. I get the same ads over and over and over. I'm sick of it! AND NOW Spotify had decided to give me THE EXACT SAME AD TWICE IN A ROW. Like, seriously?! I don't want Premium. I'm not paying $15.00 for that bullsh*t. Fix. This. NOW. I'm literally currently trying to find a different app to listen to music on, but so far nothing good. FIX IT! 😠",negative
Wonderful music...all my favorites that I haven't heard in years,positive
"Everytime I save my music to the SD card, the app decides to reset the default storage to local storage. This has happened 3 times now. I hate having to redownload everything again. It's heavily inconvenient. Fix this please. Otherwise it's a great app",neutral
"Very comprehensive catalogue of music. The one thing that would improve the experience would be the ability to ""insert"" songs into playlists at a specific point rather than having to delete/remove songs and start again.",positive
No CD quality yet!,negative
Brilliant in every way. 11/10,positive
"Gapless playback doesn't work between end and beginning of albums, it ruins the experience of certain albums, especially Nonagon Infinity which is meant to infinity loop. Otherwise it's perfect. Also really good for learning lyrics to songs.",positive
"Spotify is currently useless, I can't pay for premium anymore. Its like they don't want my money anymore",negative
This app is ok but there is some issues about it.(1) if I was having my music on shuffle it would start playing random country songs that is not even on my playlist. (2) i cant even play my songs in order the way I want if I do then I would only give like 15 seconds of listening the song so it have to be on shuffle. (3) it sucks.,negative
"Great music on Spotify,would recommend.",positive
I think it sucks we have to pay for no ads but other than that I love it :),positive
Spotify is a very good music app Just one thing about it if you have a Google Display it won't let you play all the Music you have to actually go on the app to hear the song I hate this I don't know if it is because of Google or Spotify and I don't know if this happens on Alexa but besides that it's a good music app for you to get,positive
"this app used to be good,but now you have to buy some random thing to listen to the song you want to listen to,,please change it back to be free",negative
"Found out a lot of new music & artists over years thanks to the ""Radio"" feature. Very nice algorithm, even though my taste is very wide (: One thing Spotify should improve (that bothers me daily & would also be very easy to perform in my opinion) - Enable ticking boxes so that we'd be able to add songs to multiple playlists at once, without the drag of having to press the ""more"" (3 dots) option over and over again!",positive
Look they asked nicely and I decided to rate it 5 stars it's really good,positive
In the 70's you had to flip the LP after every 5 songs! Then 80's CD's were... eject and insert the next CD. We've come along way baby!,positive
Good Quality Sound best online ..but thank you Spotify by free share with friend....,positive
I love Spotify I get all the music I enjoy and even more I may have forgotten about in one place.,positive
The app logged me out for no reason then deleted all of my downloads after sending me a forgot password link that never worked and when I did get in it logged me out immediately when I went out of the app. I had Wi-Fi the whole time as well,positive
"I used to love this app, I was happy with the certain skips a hour but now three adverts before one song and worst part is, it is not even music from my playlist being played. I have certain playlists for each activity I'm doing or who ever is using my account and I don't like how when listening to my playlist, songs that aren't added start playing.",negative
Absolutely ultimate music customized just for you. 15 year member,positive
Don't ask me I reaubscibed and now the plan I originally had I didn't pick this individual plan I had the share plan and all the music saved is no longer and also save nothing created 3 playlists sat the past 30 mins adding music not one song saved ? What's the deal,neutral
Please enable the capability of clicking on music labels within the credits.,neutral

Good music and i love this app,positive
"UPDATE: Loads slower than molasses lately! 🙄 Spotify is my ""GoTo"" music app!!!! I don't pay for the premium, I know! I do, however, feel leary about some of the security of the app and how it seems to have different music for 'suggestions' that are NOT relevant to me in anyway?? Sometimes, it even shows I've listened/watched things I haven't! With that being said, customer support could step up their game a smidge if possible for attending to inquires when emailed! Overall, 💕it!",positive
Best Music Streaming App On Play store,positive
Great app got all my favorite songs love the premium not happy about the price going up but whatever.,positive
Best choice of music.,positive
It was great but now on this new phone the app doesn't pop-up on the lock screen or the notification panel it doesn't show a preview of the current song,negative
I love Spotify but sometimes annoying when I can't find a song I like lol. Hardly ever happens,positive
"Device limit reach reached. Unable to download songs, no option to remove other devices, zero transparency on device count, 'sign out everywhere' does nothing and I have reached out to support. Spotify is awesome but this sucks. Show me my devices or let me remove them. Don't count old devices that have been offline for a year or more. Spotify apparently wants to burn money having this handled by their tech support department instead of providing an easy method for end-users.",negative
"Love it,opens so many doors WOW!!",positive
Because of so much ads,negative
Free awesome at least with ads it is free,positive
"Awesome, thank you so much for the service.",positive
The only music streaming app i use. 5/5,positive
"I love this app! Great selection, great variety and very few advertisements. WOW I just can't say enough good things without being corny! !;-)",positive
"Probably the best music streaming app I ever used till now. It has so many features like - 1. You can make blends with your friends. Spotify can create a blend for 10 people ( that's a lot ) 2. To be honest, the ads are never too much, unlike some other apps where you get an ad after every 1 song. 3. It can play music in the background. 4. It also automatically starts a song if the song which you chose to play is done playing. Conclusion : I highly recommend this app",positive
The app would not let me play my liked songs instead just random now im mad please help,neutral
Amazing music app 👌🏻👌🏻💕,positive
Probably the best app for music streaming.,positive
Overall good app but to many ads,positive
In love they make music for all the crazy music I listen to they learned I have a happy mix and depressed mix and more that helps so much.. I totally recommend this app for everyone,positive
Some songs aren't available why? And there's a bug where I pause my music and the playback goes from 1:45 to 4:45 or even 0.,neutral
"It's okay, not great, not terrible, very okay, a bit janky on Android, sometimes stops working when I lock my screen, or just stops playing. Bit dissapointing for a paid service. The general UI experience is also weak, it'd be cool for a free app made by some stoner kids, but not a premium paid-for music service. Also no Raspberry Pi OS (ARM64 support is really REALLY quite lame.)",negative
I love this app it is the best app for music in my opinion but I hate how I'm listening to a song it ends and a whole different song pops up not even in my playlist I get it's supposed to get you into new music but it is so annoying I can be listening to my favorite song I cannot wait for this next song I really like here's a song that I've never liked and the artist is not the best otherwise it's pretty good app,neutral
I use it daily. I don't catch any problems.,positive
If you want to listen to it and but it gives you 30 minutes of free listening and it will give you six skips just skip this song per hour and go to use them wisely but again a very good app,positive

Not good after recent update. I can't see what song is playing and it pauses at every notification I get,negative
Does this app just shut itself off when an update is available idk but it's getting annoying that i have to come back every 2minutes to hit play again!,negative
This app service Very fast all song avaliable here Good works Spotify 💟💟💟💯💯💯💥💥❣️❣️,positive
Updates always break the app stop updating so often,negative
Fix the app. It keeps stopping and won't show on the notification bar.,negative
Removing the Enhance feature from Like Songs makes exactly zero sense. Wish I could downgrade my version to get the feature again. Instead I have to fiddle by creating redundant playlists from my Liked Songs existing playlist.,neutral
"More commercials than music, this is no longer a music app...it's an add app! Your own greed will ruin you.",negative
"App not working properly after latest update. No panel at bottom of screen to set sleep timer, and will stop playing after 5 minutes. Before this update I would use it every day, but just frustrating now, won't be using until fixed.",negative

Very awesome app very easy to use,positive
I like their music without ads on their premium and I like their choices and my choices and it's enjoyable why I cook because I cook for a living and it's stress relieving and the music really helps,positive
"Generally fine. Not always as intuitive as the developers perhaps assume. Also hurry up and make a way to completely disable group sessions. If it's not something you want, the fact that someone in your group can change what you're listening to is very annoying. Especially when they don't even realize that they are doing it. See above for the app not always being as intuitive as developers assume",neutral
Premium user here and can't use the app. It keeps on crashing the plsy/pause bar dissappears I can't play podcasts for longer than 5 minutes. I can't move around my playlists. This has been going on for weeks now. I want my money back.,negative

I am getting sick of you guys changing what I am listening to when I press to play my liked playlist and you keep starting to play songs that are not on my liked playlist. I purposely choose to play my liked songs for a reason so stop changing it to play something that is not in my liked playlist. 😡 If I wanted to play random stuff I would say play suggested music but I don't hardly ever do that I just want the music I want to hear which is in my light playlist so stop messing with it. 😡,negative

"The first few days it was a great app where I could listen to music freely, but now I have six skips an hour! And when I go on my playlist it says THEY ADDED STUFF ON MY PLAYLIST! That's my playlist! How are you gonna add songs that I don't even like! The songs that you add are not why I made the playlist! You're just ruining it, I'm going to a diffrent app. This one is just a waste of time, and money for people who use Spotify premium",negative
This app is terrible if you want to be able to play your own songs that you own. If you want to radio that you cannot control in any way shape or form it's fine if you want a pod catcher great if you want to be able to actually play your music that you own it gives you a middle finger,negative
"This was an extorinary music app. The biggest thing is whatever we like the song we can like and put it easly in playlist. So, I think is the best app to listening music 😍🎶🎶🎵🎵🎶🎶",positive

Great app but I have been having issue like when I playy music the app closes it and when I open the app it won't let me even I tried everything also the 6 skips is too low to be honest especially I have to whatch 5 amount of ads which is ridiculous I hope this get fixed,neutral

Very very bad experience it only allows us to hear a particular song repeatedly....only when we have a playlist we could hear our favrt song rather than that it plays the same repeated song and from some particular movie ....it makes me very irritating while hearing the same set of song again again,negative

I've had buggy aps, but I can say this is the least stable app that I have ever used.",negative
Best apps and good idea for the first time,positive
Spotify the service is great for listening to music but their apps both for mobile and desktop are the absolute worst. I'm honestly thinking about switching to a different service just because of how absolutely terrible their apps are. They're always crashing or freezing and I need to keep restarting. Absolute nightmare.,negative
Better than YouTube having a great meeting better than YouTube,positive

"Overall the app is pretty nice, but the ads are way too intrusive! Sometimes they show up just as soon as I start the app after a few hours of in activity or even first time in a day. This is not normal and user-friendly. Maybe give me at least a few tracks to listen, and then play your ads, would you? The ads shouldn't be the 1st thing that I see and hear.",neutral
This app is amazing. I like that they provide us new songs even though we are not premium members except the ads. Ads are not that frustrating. It comes every 30 mins which is very good. At last I would like to recommend this app for everyone👍👍,positive
Hi since it is the 4th of July can u give all free users a 1 month premium plan because it is the 4th of July and I think it would be very generous of you guys to do that for the month of July!,positive

I've tried local debit cards from 2 banks, none of them worked and their support couldn't gave me a solution.

EDIT: Changing my review from 5 star to 2 star. There are Tons of fake BOT playlists on Spotify and there is no way to report them. One of my Heavy metal tracks got randomly added to an EDM playlist despite not pitching there. EXTREMELY FISHY. Probably trying to tempt me into purchasing streams after I saw the amount of increase in streams. But it just hurts an Artists credibility. Spotify needs to allow us to report fake playlists.

Your app performance has fallen apart in the last few weeks. Regularly it forces me into offline mode now and doesn't have my full downloaded library despite being connected to working wifi. Regularly it fails mid song as well now. Sharing music is also not working across the board now. Previously everything worked and now it doesn't work well.,negative
Im very entertaint with the variety Spotify provides! From amazing music to talk shows & up to date back stories....I'm very pleased I love that there is something for everyone to like & I will always be a loyal member.,positive

More commercials than songs. Disappointing.,neutral
I love Spotify I downloaded it when I was twelve years old and I was questioning it at first asking my self if I had a good choice. And now all I basically do is listen to Spotify.,positive

"It says ""no internet connection available"" when connected via wifi (not happening with 4g), which is very annoying because some of the content won't even try to load. However, internet connection is available.",negative
No way to turn Spotify off. 😕 Had to uninstall it to get it to stop. Pausing it doesn't shut it off.,negative

ITS AMAZING I love how i can do whatever I want with my music!! I am speechless! ❤️❤️❤️,positive
Brilliant app. I use it all the time. The only thing wrong with it is that for phone users the music is stuck on shuffle if you don't have premium. If you removed this it'd make the app better to use. Otherwise it's a handy thing to have.,positive
Good. It just need better sound quality,positive
"Enjoy listening to the songs I love. Each time I search for songs to listen to, I find ""new"" songs (oldies, but goodies) to add to my collection. And the ads are short and tolerable.",positive

All of a sudden it will no longer connects via bluetooth in any car. I have tried other apps as well as phone's and it appears to only be spotify that doesn't play.,negative
"The music is perfect, but while I play the music, it stops by itself. I don't know why, but nothing wrong with my Internet connection or my data.",neutral
"Really great experience. Everyone should try it. Though you need load or wifi still worth it. You can download it offline.. and the most finest thing I've wanted is that they have sleep timer so i don't have to worry about ongoing music playing ❤️ for premium well it's still fine, it's your choice. Thank you!",positive

Brilliant music streaming app. No complaints from me. Awesome way to even discover new music.,positive
Spotify has gotten much better than ever before. Great app and easy to use. Unfortunately they Censor quiet a bit of fact based political information like the X22 Report and Jordan Sather. But you can find them elsewhere,neutral
Just search and get the song or soundtrack. But I would reduce my rating if the adds keep on going. Because there is an add after every 2-3 songs.,neutral

I've searched a song almost 20 times and every time it plays different song... Please fix it immediately",negative
Good songs quality,positive
Fabulous except for ads😅,positive
"I don't like the new update, I was using spotify cause it was legal to listening music without using youtube, but since the newest update, I can't choose songs it was random and I need to listen till the end, I could skip but there was a limit to do that. Please bring back the old spotify",negative
"This app was a huge hit and improved a lot. But personally, with each update this game makes me wanna cry. What's even 6 skips per hour? I'm not even gonna talk about the ads... This app just turned out to be a big disappointmen. Honestly at this point it's even better to pay for YouTube music premium",negative
"Used to be 5 but now 1 star since recent update. Player stops randomly, doesn't show playing, can't start or stop, no controls need to shut the app constantly. Fixed by delete and redownload but then a few days later back to the same. Utter shite. Please give me the old version back.",negative
"Ok, the latest update is just horrible, there is a limitation of the number of skips i can do per hour, and i can only play my playlist with shuffle, now my hardwork of making the order of the songs are just ruined, don't download this, plus you need to hear all the other parts of the song just to listen to the chorus, just...

This app is my most favourite to listen to songs but some songs are hard to find but I still find them I really love it and the opinions to like the video or save it is very helpful especially if I love that song very much and want to listen to it 24/7 Thank you creator for making this app😄,positive
Wonderful music downloader app doesn't have any adds and enjoyable,positive
You have to work on the UI also music suggestions are weak and not showing the new releases.,negative

App keeps turning off since the last update,negative
Spotify is it a glitch? When I click the song I like a random music will turn on. Or when I click the music it doesn't play full song. Please Spotify fix it I really need some songs.,neutral
music list Spr Sound quality Good Device Connected Like it And Play Music 🎶 Good feeling,positive
"This app's updates are increasingly making it worse! The songs are very good even without the Premium version, but it makes it so that you will need to purchase it! Advertisements after a song ends once in a while is not that bad, but the main issue for me is the playlist customization. I can't rearrange songs, the playlist is always shuffled and sometimes it even plays songs that aren't even in the playlist for no reason! You can't even replay a song and it has a limit on skipping songs!",negative
"Too many bugs, also I can't get the Spotify widget to stay on after a locked screen. I must unlock the screen, go into the app then change the song, pause etc... not worth the premium family membership fees. I have been a loyal customer for many years, now I think I'll change to another service or way to play music in my car unless it's fixed asap! STILL NO HELP REGARDING THIS ISSUE....",negative
Great app for great music. 💯,positive

"This app is horrible you pick a song and it just make me listen to another song that I barely know probably it's cuz I use the the free kind but still it's horrible 😱. It just make me mad😠😤😡. Rating:3/10 ps. Listen to songs, play podcasts, create playlist and discover music you'll love more like music you hate😡",negative
"Great app, van listern to music without wifi!!!!",positive
"This app forces premium. I can live with ads and random shuffle, but now Spotify doesn't want to play my playlists I made anymore and spamms premium on me. It's very obnoxious and I can't recommend this app to anyone. I would pay if it was not this forced.. Currently a lot of bugs too.",negative
"I've been using Spotify for a few years now, we've a family membership. It's great, I rarely find that they don't have a song/tune I'm after. I have my favourites, and every now and then I go through their suggested listening and sometimes find a new favourite. When I visit my Dad it's on with Spotify and we're filling the house with some oldies, such as Bert Kaempfert and James Last 😀",positive
Good but if it was free it would have been the best which it is but I would like it if it is free,positive
"So far it has been nice,but I feel Spotify can do better by making videos available and also making singles available for individual download",positive
Can u remove the shaffle that we can pick songs if we connect to a device or we play on our phones,positive
"Previously was good. Recent times (a year - last months) various technical problems that continue. Audio stops playing randomly. You can also suddenly lose the control buttons of currently playing audio (you lose whole player view; audio controls and info what is playing and progress bar) and have to shutdown and restart the app to hope to get controls back etc. Now I noticed problems with skip buttons. Everything might work ok for a while, then problems continue.",negative
Play bar/controls keep disappearing and I keep having to force stop the app to get it back. Tried reinstalling but the problem is still there,negative
Best app to listen to your jams & today Download. It's so easy to use and premium is worth every penny,positive

I liked it because there were no ads. As soon as I rated the app I got an add.. like literally right after I gave it 5 stars. Now I'm hearing too many adds.. sucks.,negative
Disappearing media controls (bug known since april 2022) still hasn't been fixed.,negative

Country does not match payment option "". It matched for two months , what's the problem now?",negative
Hectic with ads,negative
"It's more money than I'd like to spend but the ad free unlimited version is worth it. Do wish they would be more understanding with the address verification with family plans as my children travel between my home and my husband as we have been separated. Sucks they don't recognize my son on our family plan bc he's only at my address part of the time. I'd also love if the playlist feature was a bit more intuitive to navigate considering I've had some from back in the ""starred"" era",positive
"Suddenly I don't have the ""shuffle play"" option on mobile anymore. I can choose a song and then it will shuffle the rest of the que, but I can't just hit play and have it shuffle to a song. I used to be able to and now I can't",neutral
Pushy and intrusive. Auto connects to Bluetooth devices with no option to stop it. Has soured the user experience.,negative

"It's a nice app I enjoy it but it misbehave after using it for some time, it doesn't show playlist you can't select a specific song in the playlists available. I know the is need for upgrade to premium but the limitation you have put in place are not important you can find another way not denying people to select their song of choice. At least downloading for offline is enough limitation for those who are not on premium. Anyway it's a good app.",positive

Been some problems with playback lately,negative
Been using Spotify for years now. I really can't fault it 😎,positive

One of the better music streaming platforms; although the free version is steadily losing functionality that is migrated to the fee based subscription service,positive

I love Spotify because wherever I go and whatever I do I can listen to my favorite songs,positive
While it's fufills the needs of music when I make a playlist and I delete a added song it doesn't mean I want another one Spotify so ya the added songs really doesn't help when I have to pay 10 dollars(which I'll never do) just so I can listen to a song I actually enjoy. without skipping a couple of songs to hope to get the correct song I want to listen too,negative

Very good and very useful. I use it every day.,positive

Spotify is not an app thats good to have without premium though if you use the web player it gets better but i like the app very much i don't really have feedback,positive
It's a really good app for listening to music on the go but I dislike when random songs I don't know pop up randomly,positive
Downloaded podcasts don't play all the way through without internet. It completely defeats the point of downloading...,negative
Not so good. Unable to log in even if i m a premium member. Also not able to download music. Premium services are not available but debiting my account without giving me services every month,negative
"Free version of Spotify is awful now, instead listening to add to get 30 minutes of music you get two songs and over a minute of ads. Also premium keeps going up in price it's a waste of money at this point",negative
I liked it how it was in the beginning all this updating I don't like it messes it up,neutral
Music is good but the problem is with advertisement,negative
It is the best song app,positive
I was just trying to logout and it made me leave the app and when I went back on it I couldn't even use it cause it kept me in the logo and this has been happening for 4 days now yall better fix this also fix the fact that we can't hear the sound while in suggest songs,negative

It's gotten so bad recently The ads are so much Now the app also started to just stop Playing and needs to force shut down automatically.,negative
Best quality of audio but sometimes the ad will come in front of audio,neutral
This app used to be great and the only thing I'd use to listen to music but now I can't login or else it crashes my phone and forces it to restart. I can't delete it because it crashes my phone and forces it to restart and so my only option would be to factory reset my phone.,negative
So far so good. It's been amazing working with you all.,positive
"Horrible ad placing. Like there's literally 5 ads for every song. And they're not short 5 second ads no they're long as 30 second ads. That's a whole song worth of ads for every SINGLE song, like I'm not here for ads.",negative
Very beautiful journey with Spotify,positive
"Positive part is your library. Anything you search and it is right there. If possible, don't increase the volume sharply while playing ads. It hurts sometimes.",positive
Nice except ads,positive
The app is great. I just don't know why the canvas feature doesn't work,positive
"Music for free!!! and song's you love,plus it recamend's music of the same johnra,come on",positive
I love Spotify. Everything is easy to find and tailor fitted for my style of listening,positive
"I love how there are so many songs to play from Country to K-Pop, plus it has some amazing podcasts. I would rate it a 5 star, but the only thing is, is that you cant change how loud or how low the music or podcast is, ye you could just lower down your phone, but if you have other things, like if you were playing a game, you wouldn't be able to lower the music down so you can hear the game. But overall an amazing app.",positive
"I had a really good experience with Spotify But that was only when I had premium. when ur on the free plan u basically can't listen to music in the way you want at all. your playlist/songs are always on shuffle which is weird because sometimes you want your music in a certain order And then u only get 6 SKIPS an hour? So plus shuffle+ only 6 skips is already very strict. To add on you get 4 ads that are all 30 seconds, every 15 MINUTES. This is pushes people to other apps for a better experience",neutral
Easy to customised playlist. Wide variety of songs,positive
It's good music service the only issue I have is the premium adds I don't mind having regular adds or not having more skips but the constant shoving in your face adds for premium are bad,positive
"New to this , but had a good time listening!",positive
I love the app. Its just too intelligent,positive
"I want to stop downloading music because I'm not listening to it, but once I turn off the download, it continues to download, which is annoying because what's the point of turning off the download when it's still downloading? You should also include an easy-to-create playlist, such as my favorite songs. I put it on a playlist by category, but my patience isn't long enough to go through hundreds of songs one by one. There are many issues that can be improved. What a waste of money.",negative
I love all the music but I hate podcasts. Literally less than zero interest in them but it's always shoving them in my face and often they have awkward pictures that I really don't care to see. The latest is they are in a language I don't even know so that's... cool... Would honestly give 5 stars if it weren't for that. I wish I had the option to remove the podcast section or at least dislike them so I don't have to see the awkward pictures.,negative
Love this app. Easy listening has a lot of music and podcast anything ..its great.,positive
This app is very very good to enjoy music.,positive
Can be very frustrating to use at times. Ive had a old phone and now a new one. Same problems. Music rarely shows up what im playing on my home screen and sometimes doesnt show up at all on the spotify app when i clearly just select a song or podcast meaning i cant skip. To fix this you have to do a reinstall or logout login which fixes it for a time before going through the process again. I feel like they have also add a lot more shameless advertisement on podcasts for premium members.,neutral
Ok I can listen to my favorite songs and I don't need a premium I like the podcast,positive
Brings in the best music I need to hear.,positive

"worst possible app. constant bugs and issues, shuffle is a joke, and the weekly recommendations are at least 50% songs i already listen to. premium is losing its worth every day.",negative
less ads would be great but I understand that you can't do that,positive
I've been using this app for over 5 years. It's just recently started to go on another playlist once you've finished the end of your playlist it goes on to another playlist which is really annoying. But other than that issue it's a great app for music if you don't want to pay for iTunes and this is why I'm rating this app 4 stars,positive
"I enjoy using the app and have all of my music, podcasts and some audiobooks all in one place. I wish there was a better way to organize files a little more specific then what is available now but I make it work. Quality has always been good!

It's alright I do have issues When looking for music Some you don't have when I try look for them,positive
I want to cancel my membership but there is no where in the app to do so,negative
"The amount of ads is pretty ridiculous. It used to play one ad for 30 minutes of ad-free listening, and it would do this /every/ 30 minutes. It was perfect. Now will give me like one 30 minute ad-free listening session a day. And when not ad free, there are ads practically every 2 songs. I would love for it to go back to the way it was, because I am absolutely tired of the ads.",negative
"It has been an upgrade from our last service provider, pan something ?",positive

"Your app needs a MAJOR redesign.The Joe Rogan podcast deal didn't make podcasts better on your app. Try a redesign of the UI that makes sense. That makes it easier to discover new things.Make it a more social and Connected network. Some new button deisgns, colour schemes, symmetry, minimalist.DARK AND LIGHT MODE. I can go on forever.Pump that cash into a user friendly design and make it available both for iOS and Android at the same time.Give users control.windows Xp media player visualisation.",negative
When I play a podcast most of the time now it doesn't have the page to set a timer or fast forward the podcast etc. Considering I'm paying premium I expect better,neutral
I hate this app like there is a couple times when the Wi-Fi is strong but then it's still having problems working like it has its times when it doesn't work the way it's supposed to meaning the music won't work or the music will glitch which is why I hate this app other than that it's a pretty bad app it even shows lyrics which is good if you want to learn the lyrics of the song.

I go to shuffle to play the full version and it plays a song i did not even bother to choose. I think its unfair to those who cant go to premium because i cannot be paying every month , its useless. I dislike this app now. I wont waste my time going to premium. I hate this premium, so unfair.",negative
It sometimes goes back to a songs it already played and i have to listen to them again.,positive

Moreover buttons partially need minutes to react. Spotify tells me over and over again I got no connection, though everything else Internet related works just fine. The SD Card implementation just works for a part. The app is laggy, crashes and basic functions stop working over time. Please start working on performance & fixes",positive

Love the ease of use and the huge choice of albums. Use it on Wi-Fi for tunes on our Harley and our patio. Uses very little battery.,positive

Ok I've resorted to begging because it's literally impossible to make playlists without being able to hear a sample of the song in the add section. Please.

I have rock with Spotify from day one and they are the only music app that i will ever deal with. They are the best at what they do. I highly recommend Sporify to everybody.,positive
"Used to be good. I have over 1800 songs in a playlist and it will play the same maybe 150 songs. It'll also be at ""the end"" of the playlist waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy too soon. What happened Spotify?",negative
Realy nice app. I can hear music very clearly.,positive
When I logged out it never opened again. I reinstalled and restarted my phone. It's still stuck at the spotify logo screen.,negative
"While I think that Spotify deserves way more stars, I do habe some problems with the app in general. For example, while in Offline Mode, the app will repeatedly reset all downloaded songs, so that it simply doesn't work. The Playlist I've downloaded shows the little icon at the top that it's all downloaded, but when I scroll down, the songs just don't play and neither do they have the little download icon. It's just really annoying me because then I have to redownload the songs and use Data",negative
Amazing if it was totally free,positive
Good functions well designed,positive
"When i am listening to music it keeps on randomly pausing the music for a split second the carries on playing it, or I have to turn on my phone to stop it from doing that. I have the latest update and it still does it. I think it is still experiencing glitches.",negative

It won't let me play other songs without it being in playlist shuffle either. It would be fine if that wasn't added, Let people enjoy listening to the music they like and not have to pay for premium to stop that auto shuffle.",negative
Pauses for no reason and podcasts just refuse too play at all,negative
The best music streaming site there is!,positive

"I have used my Spotify on numerous devices over the years. That being said, Spotify has always been a challenge to play music and podcasts in areas with less than great cell service. Web pages and YouTube videos will load but Spotify will not. Very frustrating when I pay for this subscription. Saved music and podcasts take extremely long to register when offline and will often tell me ""no connection "" Overall I love the content so I will keep paying",neutral

Spotify is a very good place to listen to music but it's not the best without premuim. But on the bright side premuim is not very expensive and in fact quite affordable it is a clever business method to earn and I'm down for it,positive

Spotify's is an amazing app to listen to music but the only problem is that we can't keep the songs in the order we wish for and there is a big problem of ads in between....We can't break free of ads until we upgrade to premium...,positive

"Use every day on a paid for choice, so no ads. Just add to my play lists as and when. No drop outs & used the downloads option while on holiday so didn't have to worry about Wi-fi or data use.",positive
"Its a great music app, i really love it but my suggestion is, could you make an update where we could download 1 song and not the entire album, because if we have to download all the song in the album, its really consuming our storage on our phones.",positive
Changed my review because the app didn't work for me. I accidentally logged out from my acc but when I tried to login again the app just blank(black). Nothing. I've restarted my phone and reinstall the app but still the same thing happened.,negative
Bad Experience. When streaming/playing downloads the glitches or stop playing. Why there is no support desk?!,negative
That is a good music app,positive
It used to be a great app but now it just became bad. You have to watch atleast 5 videos after a song and you only get 6 skips an hour (a ridiculously low amount). When you find the song you want it ridiculously plays a different song by another singer instead the song you want. I'm not sure how you guys get payed to do this but you need to fix it now.,negative

"What happened to Spotify it's not the same, whenever i choose a single or album the songs are not there and when i it different music will play",negative

It's great. All the music I could ever wish for.,positive
"Always barges in. Connect phone to the car, spotify app starts playing. Connect it to ANYTHING else it starts playing. Overrides EVERYTHING! Can't kill it, even a forced stop can't stop it. This is the most annoying BULLY app I ever download. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. LOOK FOR something ELSE.",negative
"Great, but I was hoping to be able to change podcasts while driving, but that seems dangerous.",positive
"It's a great app, i just wish the playlists were not shuffled by songs that are not in the playlist",positive
It so good 10/10 the best place to lease to music,positive
"Frequent crashes, also I pay for the premium and still get advertising for the JRE!? Still better then pandora but maybe not worth buying.",neutral
"""Offline Mode"" is the biggest useless feature ever. I might actually cancel my Spotify acct over the amount of times I've tried to listen to my DOWNLOADED music while away from data service and CANT. HOW USELESS.",negative
My experience with Spotify is great. I love this platform. Thanks Spotify team.,positive

"Great, love the choices and suggestions",positive

I wish I didn't have to use data whenever I wanted to listen to all my songs at once,positive
"I can't live without Spotify,i love it",positive
The app is so useful. You can listen to the songs while doing anything n everything. Songs makes emotions more valuable. But I think they should decrease the rate of ads a little bit that's why I am giving it 4 for now but It will be set to 5 when the ad rate is deacresed. The song quality is so good that's why I will recommend to use this app for sure.,positive
You have to buy there stupid premium just to play a single song I literally have to go through 20 songs just to get to the one I want,negative

Music quality not so good,negative
"It bothers me that when you don't have a premium when the ads come on they sound 10 times louder than the music sounds, which is a problem when you listen to music with a speaker or with headphones, because it forces you to turn up the volume because you don't listen to the song and then feel like you're going deaf from the commercials",negative
Great music of the 70s and 80s,positive
I cant seem to get a way to download a song and listen offline. But the app is so far so best,positive

Too many ads,negative
"It's a great app but there are so many adds inbettwen the songs, albeit they only pop up after about 3-7 song or if you restart a song. But I've had I up to 8 ads in a row before my next song began to play, and the ads could range from 15 to 30 seconds. But the audio is great and all the options in the settings are enjoyable. So, the main thing is want changed is the huge amount of ads, after all they take up more time then most of the songs themselves! It's just overkill at this point.",positive
would be 5 stars but when I'm playing music when I've listened to every song it plays random songs,positive

Stop adding songs to the Playlist i create if I wanted to listen to that music i would have played a list that would have me discover songs!

This is normal when I play music, and it shouldn't be. Rare for my playlists to have no ads for 30 minutes as Spotify states. It used to not be this messy. Please code whatever to fix this, it's an everyday situation. I shouldn't jump from each playlist to try and find the right spot to get ""30 min free listening.""",neutral
Add a damn option to confirm whether you want to connect to a certain Bluetooth device or not. Had too many occasions where the options for connections would bounce all over the place due to constantly finding and forgetting ones only to mis-click away from the thing I wanted instead to a device someone else is always using. Awkward to use and inconvenient.,negative

Is the songs policy always behind a paywall or you guys just want to get money by premium... This isn't why ""Free"" streaming apps are for... The shuffle isn't helping you by you're problems.... It's just making the listener's mood and their problems unsolvable...",negative
I've had the same Spotify premium for 6 years and let me tell you. WAYYYYYY better than apple music or Amazon whatever it's called. 10/10 recommend. Keep up the good work Spotify. I love you ❣️,positive
The only problem is when you dont have premium it gives you like 6 ads at a time,positive
"Great , affordable Music app!",positive
"Podcasts turn off by themselves, sound plays without app controls",negative

I absolutely love this app. The free version is amazing and premium is even better. I get to listen on the way to work and simply whenever I want. There's music for everyone. As a lesson whose tastes varie from day to day and are simply all over the place I'm very satisfied. They also have people who are willing to help if there are any issues. 10 our of 10 in my opinion.,positive
Too many ads. It's annoying.,neutral
"Its the best especially, if you have premium.",positive
I love every aspect of this app!,positive
"Great at finding songs, and making recommendations.",positive
"There's no order to shuffling, you'll be listening to an up-beat song and suddenly an extremely depressing song comes on, it really ruins the mood. I'm sure if they can organize their playlists into upbeat and sad songs, they can organize their shuffling.",neutral

Lately the app has this pause thing going on whilst listening to some music. Once thought it's my headphones but it was not,positive
"If I could rate this a 0 I would, My name is Hannah and I'm 11 and I absolutely hate this app. I downloaded it and signed in made a playlist and what happend you may ask, well they added what they wanted onto it, it's so rude and when I tried to delete it of it said that I couldn't because they had picked it special for me, and it wouldn't let me play any other songs in my playlist, so just like that an hour after I down loaded it it's been installed an hour later. I'm never downloading again",negative
Its perfect Music To use for study or for fun some to use to dance to and sing to it is perfect,positive
Very good app for any other music 🎶 you can find what ever you like to look up.,positive
I cant play my favourite music cuz im free listener before 2 days ago I could to play my favourite music but now I can't I think because im in free mode,negative

"Great, easy to use. The cross fade between songs is a nice feature",positive
"The app is amazing! I really love the interface, its easy to use, and collation of suggested playlist is awesome",positive
My Spotify apps was force stop,positive
Love it but one downside is i pay $10 a month for downloaded songs that never show up when I dont have signal. So it's kinda feeling like a waste of time and money.,neutral

My app is not working i have the logo in the middle of the screen i restarted it and i uninstall it and download it again still not working help,negative

Wont let me play my songs and keeps playing other songs.,negative
Everything is v.well but when i search a song then single song isn't shown as search result then i played album then it's auto set on loop then the song isn't played another artist song played i don't know why but please change this feature or guide user.,negative
Really good app to listen to music with! Downside is that you need mobile data to listen to music when you don't have Wi-Fi and to get no Wi-Fi/mobile data needed to listen to it you need to pay and some people are broke as *cough cough* me *cough cough* 😭😭,positive
Is just a great music app in general,positive
honestly the best music app if you ask me,positive
"So easy to use and has everything I need. Great for all ages too, and Spotify Premium is perfect for me!",positive

Spotify changes my playlist to music I did not select. I find this annoying,negative
Sad to say that since the latest Samsung phone update Spotify will not work. It appears to be connected showing green moving bars on the tune selected but is mute. Also the app appears frozen as it is not possible to start or pause.,negative
The first app which is bestest for listening musics,positive
Excellent job with lyrics. Love this app ❤️,positive
A have a lot of problems with it but the most important is the fact that I can't search up a song and play it on its own without listening the that specific whole album. And if you try selecting the album to pick out and play that specific song it won't work it just plays what it want from that album. And also freezes my attempt to skip the songs till I get to the one I want after 6 tries for one whole hour. I was actually trying to rate it 0 but I see 1 is the lowest,negative
"Works in my smart TV, plays good song, everything available. I always buy the premium subscription and I highly recommend it.",positive
"my spotify started freezing and won't open. When I try to log in it pretends to log in and then shows the login screen again and doesn't log back in. It started happening like this last night, I logged out of my account and it stayed that way. I deleted the app, restored or restarted but still the same, please help.",negative
I've been paying more for less. Every time I open the app I'm spammed with an ad about some new content from someone I've never shown interest in. Now I'm getting ads for their car thing.,negative
Love to stream podcasts and wide variety of music.,positive
"Honestly in the beginning I loved Spotify. I even decided to start paying for it so I could listen to music with unlimited skips and no commercials. However, in the past few weeks, especially since getting my new phone the app randomly stops playing and turns off. When in my car it skips like a CD constantly. It's frustrating and frankly I'll probably cancel my subscription if not fixed, even if it is a minor inconvenience, it shouldn't be happening.",negative
It's cool I hate how persistent the ads can be sometimes but yeaa,positive
"Same old glitchy BS from the beginning. This service isn't worth the money. Won't play app closes itself. Stop playing randomly, start playing randomly. So all and all not worth it",negative
I do love this app. I use it daily.,positive
"What the hell happened?? I used to love using Spotify but now it keeps pausing randomly in the middle of my songs and podcasts. And there's some kind of weird glitch where when you press play, it'll start playing the song. But you can't pause it, skip to the next song, or even see what song is playing. I don't know what happened but this app is barely usable at this point.",negative
Easy to use and fast,positive
I get my fix whenever I need it. IM ADDICTED! It's a great addiction. Please don't leave me. Sounds like a red flag I know. Thanks Spotify. 😃,positive
Iam unable to open spotify it is always stuck with its symbol and black screen when i open the app😭,negative
man when in phone i can't play the song i like form the playlist sometimes it adds unwanted songs,neutral
I loveeeee itttttt....but ads just spoil d mood!!,positive
Offers very good selection of my favoured music,positive
Its really good for your mind. Because music is a drug and Hip Hop is my drug dealer....,positive
Spotify has great music! Still learning how to use it though... I can honestly say that it's better than YouTube.,positive
The now playing part doesn't show up so I can't compile a playlist,negative
"The apps sound quality is very nice and I appreciate it but sometimes the songs stop playing and I have to play it again and again, the ads are the most important part like I know that I don't have a premium pack but it does not mean that there will be ad after every song and not one but two aur three, that's very annoying and irritating. Please fix it 🙏",neutral
The best music library,positive
"Excellent! Does all it promises, and more.",positive
The Android wrapper is garbage. Extremely glitchy from time to time even though my updates are turned on. Main issue is that I cannot see what song/podcast is playing (so now I am stuck at 1.5 x speed on Stevie Wonder--a setting I used for listening to podcasts).,neutral
Best music app on the play store,positive
Perfect music app 🙏❤️,positive
Best education for all ages. Music has become an essential aspect for all of our lives in the future as well as the past.,positive
Great App ( can be lagy),positive
"Whenever i skip a song, it goes hidden. Why? Just because i didnt want to listen to that song then, or i accidentally skipped it, i cant listen to it? And removing it from hidden is hard too. It doesnt work most of the time. I tapped a hidden song hundreds of times to get it unhiden, but that only worked twice. If i want to make it hidden, give me the option to do so, dont make it mandatory to skip the song. And i cant link to google account. I have just lost everything because of that. 0/10bad",negative
App does not seem to work on Samsung Galaxy A50! Cannot search for music. App crashes if I attempt to add a song to a Playlist and cannot see Playlist after adding songs on the web. No option appears to play songs either. I have deleted and reinstalled the app several times and have logged out and back in several times. I have done everything that I know to reduce background apps running and ensure wifi signal strength. Simply put your app is not compatible with my phone.,negative
This good and bad I can't skip only 6 time each days and I don't even have back skips pls delete that pls,positive
Great music but after a while the music started cutting out and it had been cutting out every few seconds and if I didn't turn my screen back on it would keep cutting out so I uninstalled and reinstalled it and now nothing loads. I have been using spotify for about 4-5 years now and nothing has happened but now it won't load at all.,negative
Fantastic comprehensive range of music,positive
Amazing plain and simple,positive
Too much ads,negative
This is the best music player I have ever had Spotify has all the song you like you can put them in your liked category and you you have daily mixes that you will enjoy that's why I love using Spotify 5 stars.,positive
Love the app! But one thing is i dont like the fact that the same ad repeats telling us to get spotify premium. Other then that i HIGHLY reccomend,positive
Gives you ads a lot and you get like 10 30 seconds ads in a row,negative
"Total fun, easy.",positive
"Just got started with Spotify, but so far it is very user-friendly and has a great variety artists.",positive
Wonderful application. No issues so far,positive
Some of the popular music I listen or I can understand and sing or use for enterprise and faith are in Spotify I do not listen to most music yet because of my culture and religion which writes that music is the opium and doping of non-believing atheists and azazel,positive
Everytime I install the app it opens it but it won't go to the log in page it only stays on the Spotify logo and it just stays there I've tried to install and uninstall the app but it doesn't work. And even tryed to restart my phone and check my data and it still doesn't work.,negative
I can't believe I pay £10 a month for this and you still block the whole screen on startup with ads asking to refer a friend.,negative
Very good selection of songs,positive
Nah you guys are bad I went to play some of my liked songs and it gave me something else songs I don't even know. I just wanna listen to my favorite song.,negative
I have a free account but I just got charged $9.99.,negative
"The app has been fine for me ever since I downloaded it (probably 2 years ago), but since 2 days ago it hasn't been working for me at all. Only opens with the logo showing up in the middle of a black screen, then never responding after. Tried all the things I could in reddit and guides online, same result. Uninstalled multiple times and reinstalled only to be met with the same exact result. Tried deleting cache and data, still the same thing. Hope my app gets fixed :(",negative

Enjoy the choices I have with Spotify,positive
probably the best music app out there but I've just got one tiny problem... i wish we could rearrange songs in our Playlist. we can do that in our queued songs but not in playlists. atleast let us rearrange in the playlist that we've made ourselves.,positive
It was fine before update but after the update I can't pick the songs I want to play on the playlist I made to listen to Please fix it!!,negative
Good app but still some songs should be there I like BTS still with you song and many more English and Hindi so 😶,neutral

Best companion for Road trip 😃 Awesome quality of sound and recommendations of playlists are likewise,positive
Great! I used to have qq music (the Chinese version of Spotify) and im trilingual plus an opera lover so I miss being able to have translation of foreign languages. Spotify only offers English lyrics for English songs. Translations of lyrics into english. That's the only feature I would suggest.,positive
"No adds, loads quickly, and all the music I like!",positive
Love Spotify listen to it all the time,positive
"Ui updated now it's like the rows but each row has 1 item in it like , if your gonna make it scroll down instead of across can you at least make the size of the album art fit",positive
Great service terrible annoying pestering adds and emails I got four emails in one day about the same promotion. I've unsubscribed from the email but the point is that it's shameless and shouldn't happen. At this point I'd rather go back to YouTube adds than deal with this over the top in your face self promotion. Good job losing a customer spotify.,negative

It's annoying like when ever I'm doing my play list it comes up with random songs that I don't like 😐 andit evens makes me so frustrated with this app I did it as a 1 star because it doesn't play Ur song it plays something else.,negative
Fix your stupid app. It's been crashing for months now,negative
Brilliant love the podcasts and the access to music,positive
"THIS IS A GOOD APP ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKES MUSIC !! (man i can't really function well without spotify honestly) The only problem is, why can't I subscribe to a premium plan using smart courier? As a student, that's the only way I can pay for premium. It only says ""oops, something went wrong, please try again."" which happened to me lots of times. The GETPIN method used to work really well but now I can't get a pin. What to do? Or are you able to fix this? :(",positive
It's a wonderful app love it ..no problem at all ..and it's really nice coz you have all sorts of different genres of music 🎶 to choose from so yeah well done 👍 Spotify.. great app and I will also recommend it to my family and friends 💓.cheers mate,positive
Very helpful if finding new music and genre's and it let's me feel somewhat of a personalized selection when finding music,positive
"Very annoying app for the Android version. Yes, I am using the free version, but it does not mean I cannot back track a playlist, only giving forward/next track option. Cruel thing you have got. I still prefer the PC version. And if you like get the Windows version spoilt too.",negative
Good app I like the way it gives the freedom of choosing your own artists,positive
Am enjoying this app Spotify l get all the music l want and it's very less on data usage,positive
The worst app ever... Was working fine for a few but now I can't even login and i used to use this app for studying but now as i can't even login it's becoming awful....

"I love this app, it's great, I get to listen to crisp, high quality music. HOWEVER, Spotify mobile is almost straight irritating to use. I understand you guys need to make money, but not letting me even get to pick the song, and only letting me use 6 skips an hour??? Or how about when I make a new playlist for my alarm, I choose several songs I liked, only to wake up to a song I DID NOT put on the playlist? Is that a glitch, or an incredible inconvenience to the user?",neutral

This app is good very nice songs and ad free I love this app very much ❤ 😍 😄 😀 👏,neutral
"I would appreciate if you can put the heart to select liked songs, on the lock screen bar. When I drive and find a cool song, it is safer to have it available on my lock screen than to unlock my phone and try and open the app. Deezer has it and would really love you guys to do it, too?!",neutral
We really need a feature to hide censored songs. It might come as a surprise to you but most of the users are adult and will not die of a heartattack if they hear a swear word in a song. However we get annoyed when we hear our favorite songs edited out,negative
I love how when you put in a certain artist it gives you a list of songs in the same genre. Really makes it easier to look up songs and hear new ones you've never heard before 😎👍👍,positive
Why the hell can't you play selective music or stop random music being added to playlists that are related to anything never thought I'd say SoundCloud is better,negative

For the past month I've had to either clear the clutter or clear what's been saved or delete and install again more than I can count I love the music on Spotify but every time I'm listening to something and it skips it and the settings aren't off I mean every now and then it just works fine but then after a while it starts skipping again or it starts changing when I'm not ready to change the music I don't know if this is a system error I downloaded every possible update ???????? Thank you,negative
It it too good music app during travel time .It shows rarely ads and gives good sound and many more functiona ..I loved it ..I used to enjoy very much this app ...thanks and good luck Spotify team..,positive
They updated it to where I can't use my favorites playlist or any playlist and to the point where I can't listen to any song I'd like to listen to. I am highly disappointed in this.,negative
Spotify is a good app overall but the only problem for me is when I try to change to another song it just loads and plays a short part of the song and then plays another song which I do not like.,positive
I love now being alone because my god and Spotify is with me ..,positive
Wow I love the app It's great I pray it won't change,positive
"I have very eclectic musical tastes and Spotify connects me to music I love from all genres and eras. It has also been a wonderful way for me to connect musically with my son as we expand each other's musical universe. I find it also has more content in my favorite genres such as old reggae, than the other leading service. I joined Spotify a few years ago and it has improved my life in so many great ways.",positive

"It's almost perfect, but there are some things that make me rage, an example is when you play a music/playlist and turn off your phone, the music will keep playing just 2 sometimes and then stop the music instead to keep going. Doesn't matter whatever you do it's always happen, even if you set up to play the music in loop. I think that is just happen to me, although, the rest is perfect.",positive

Great app for streaming. Except randomly stops playing and I have to push the play button to get it going again.,positive
this app is not good because it keeps shuffling songs i just want to hear one song not playlist it should take away the shuffle like if you want it shuffled then do it on your playlist,negative

Outstanding music streaming. Even obscure music can be found. Rarely issues and when they occur they are fixed quickly.,positive
Smooth experience only challenge is not able to identify original or remix,positive
"Buggy mess. Don't use if you want to listen to podcasts. No player until you open the app back up and a lot of the time it's missing. I have to close the app and reopen just to find the pause button. Also it's way too sensitive and often accidentally skip the episode by the slightest ""swipe"" and often shows finished when I go back which is infuriating when the podcast is hours long.

So good but only if u have spotify primuim,positive

It is a really good streaming service to listen to any song that you can for free. But the function to filter the liked playlist isn't working. I don't know why as this is a useful feature. I'm not sure if this is the same for everyone else though. But other than that it is possibly the best music streaming service there is.,positive
Please come up with light mode feature 🐱,positive
Because of I listen all bts song in Spotify,positive
"In the latest update they adopted pandora's 'you must have premium to have a nonshuffled playlist' and everything is now a radio station making playlists redundant unless you're premium. Honestly I'd rather use youtube, soundcloud, or my old tablet that can still play nonshuffled songs. Or the spotify web player cause it's only mobile that's suffering this Also too many ads not enough ad breaks. And they can string 15 ads together, crash the device, and make you listen to 5 more.",negative
"Started as an almost 5/5 app. But then product managers started to ""improve"" the product and with each upgrade the product is less usable for me. It's more about what they want you to listen to instead of what you want to listen to. Offline songs get deleted on a regular basis so you have to re-download them again and again. Last time I learned that on an airplane...",negative
The app is good but at times it stops playing all of a sudden,positive
Amazing experience just perfer yt music better,positive
"It is a good app, with most songs I have looked for are available, but recently my liked songs are not showing when I log into Spotify on my laptop, and I have restarted the app, and reinstalled it several times, but I still can't see my liked songs, so not sure why this is happening 😢",positive
Sound quality is perfect but too many ads without premium subscription which is disgusting. That's it.,positive
"I listen to music many hours every day. Spotify has such a great variety of music. I love their custom daily playlists. I find music I find music I haven't heard in years in them, fantastic.",positive
Super music player i enjoy it,positive

"Was awesome until I opened it today and couldn't have songs play on laps, not bring able to play songs by themselves. And more..",neutral
1year yusing dis app dis in nice song,positive
"I remember when I first started with spotify it's use to be good, then the price went up and my playlists went down simple mean other things will follow, I will watch and see",neutral
I've had Spotify premium since 2017 and it's never failed to provide the right tunes when nessecary. Never need wifi to play a song. Spotify is the BEST!!!,positive
"DO NOT USE SPOTIFY if you intend to store music offline to an external storage card. There is a massive issue with the app not recognizing the card after a restart and trying to re-download all your offline music to internal storage creating multiple locations in the process. It's only been an issue for about 7 years so the developers clearly haven't got a clue how to resolve it, they just palm to off with the usual reinstall advice WHICH DOESN'T WORK.",negative
"Worst app I pay for. I have to delete it and re-install at least 3 to 4 times a week. It either stops playing after 10 minutes or won't stop playing. I have to open the phone and close the app. Then it starts playing when I get back in the car and won't stop when I get out of the car. I have to open the phone, open the app and delete the app.",negative
"And again - Nothing has changed! Original post🤦‍♂️- The App now: Stops every 10 minutes. Carrys on playing & cannot be shut down. Does not upload. Yes, I've uninstalled. The latest update is poor, I have no idea how the UX or QA cycle ever got signed off. Downloaded content will not play when you move onto another episode. Cuts out. UI looks crowded and not smooth at all. Paying premium for a product that does not work properly. Acknowledge & own the faults Spotify, then fix! Thanks",negative
It's a very good app! It doesn't shows ads very often..i can skip or play many songs and then the ad may play but not always.,positive
Never ending music pleasure,positive
"Spotify is an audio content access platform. Mostly, that works well. However, there seem to always be issues with the basics while new features get rolled out that are really not necessary, and sometimes even unclear. For example, on a flaky network connection, I cannot access my downloaded/offline content. That obviously defeats the purpose. Another one was that, on a flaky network, a podcast kept pausing and resuming a half-second, contentwise, later. @Spotify Please focus on solid basics!!!",neutral
At first it was grt but now It's not at all working like before. I select a song but it plays another,negative
"You basically can't use it without premium at all. Also bugs and It shows I'm offline despite playing music from my own playlists just fine, but I can't search for music. Unusable mess pushing weird stuff on me when it does see the Internet connection. Unless you pay and build your own playlists, knowing exactly what you want to listen to yourself I'd never recommend. It's for people that love music itd for average person what doesn't know what to listen to and can get manipulated by algorithm",negative
Spotify is really good And with it lyrics when playing music,positive
Man Spotify's the 🐐. Great to know that it has put COVID warning in the appropriate episodes of Joe Rogan Podcast. ( ͝° ͜ʖ͡°)ᕤ,positive
User friendly and recomends great personalised mixes. I do feel that there should be an option to donate to musicians on free music platforms,neutral
Amazing bro but lessen the adds to like every ten songs instead of two💀,positive
Too many ads,negative
Great music any music u like to hear,positive
Ads are disturbing,positive
"It's amazing to be able to find and listen to songs you haven't heard in ages and the recommendations lead you to bands you forgot about ! Thanks 😊. Update 7-21-22 it's still worth the payment. I've favored many songs from their suggestions, you asked me to rate again and I see why. You're awesome Spotify !",positive
Great app but Spotify can't play some song and please add song in Spotify some song are not in Spotify,neutral
No change to my Spotify app. Funny how it doesn't work for me on my Android yet my wife and sons have no problems with their phones? Maybe it is because I openly criticize the Bozo some people elected to be president and the fact police are bold as ever? Spotify I'll be closing you out and you will get no more money from me. Let's Go Brandon !,negative
Good music but I can't stream music through data so only downloaded music while on the road :(( didn't have that the past couple years,negative
This app is great as it makes play lists depending on what you've listened to before and generally puts together a good list for you to listen to.,positive
I love the playlists and the wide variety of songs and podcasts,positive
Outstanding application..this app can cunsume a little data. It has an advertise in m7CH quantity..,positive
If I can't change the theme of my lyrics at least give me nice themes because your current themes are very boring,negative
You can find any track you want brilliant app.,positive
Trash login system. ... Whenever i try logging into some other device through my mobile number...the OTP never arrives. 😠 . . . STOP BEGGING FOR PREMIUM.,negative
My only and favorite app for music. I pay for premium to skip all the commercials but enjoy the fact you can follow friends playlists and make multiple playlists of your own in the library. Best music app thus far. 💚,positive
"The best online Music app ever !! The quality of music, collection of songs, non-premium service quality & value-for-money premium plans... There's no match to Spotify !! Note: This review after 1 year of non-premium usage, 1 month of premium usage of Spotify & using umpteen number of other premium & non-premium online Music apps including prime music for the last 1 year.",positive
I just love Spotifyyyyyyy!!!!,positive
I do not recommend this. It keeps playing extra songs and not the ones I want. I hate this,negative
Well i dont have a prob is that when i try to listen to music it gives me 1 or 2 ads and then says i have 30min of no ad but only last 10min and also now it gives me 8 or 9 ads,negative
Very Good Music Quality 😊,positive
why do you keep updating it ffs your making it worse! if it aint broke dont fix it whoever makes the updates for this sack them on the spot hes a retard.,negative
"The best, deleted other streaming app when I found out about Spotify. So perfect",positive
Just the best app to listen to music.,positive
"Spotify is great I love it, mainly because I listen to music 24/7 but my main problem with the app is the fact that it barely ever plays the songs on my Playlist, it just play suggested songs before it even thinks about the songs that I actually want to listen to. This even happens when I play my liked songs.",neutral
"The experience is out of thi world,just wonderful !",positive
Fabulous and entertaining really appreciated. Thank you 😊,positive
Very good play list,positive
A good music streaming app,positive
"I like Spotify even more now that there's lyrics to the songs. I also like Spotify because I can leave the app, do other things on my phone and still be able to listen to the music.",positive
Brilliant ap - have the paid for version. The free one is difficult to use as the songs don't play in order. But the paid for ap is fantastic.,positive
Easy app to use and enjoy,positive
"Recently spotify hasn't been letting me listen to songs and says that all playlists that I click on are empty (even random ones) whenever I click on my library it's empty even tho I know I havent deleted any of my playlists, whenever I go to my own profile they are all there though and it's getting really annoying since this is a streaming app that I love",negative
when karaoke feature available?,positive
Fine app if you want to pay for the service and I try to listen without premium service and you got to go through 10 ads before playing and you can only listen to your list as they play it and if you skip you only get 6 skips per hour to listen to your own song list. Wasn't this way when I started this app about a month ago... It's a shame,negative
Exceptional.. 4 stars just coz of the annoying ads in free version,positive
"I am ""guaranteed 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" after listening to 4 advertisements. Two (3 minute) songs later, I get two more advertisements. At least be honest and just tell me that I'm going to get ads every couple of songs.",neutral
Spotify you need to fix your app ok? I was literally listening to in the middle of the night and boom it plays a random song so plss Spotify bring back the repeat ft because I love this app and it can be improved but I think your just doing this so more people purchase premium.this is a money grab I can just purchase premium but I have more thing to deal with so pls Spotify bring back the repeat ft,negative
Great App. All Songs available at a single click.Amazing.,positive
Lot's of ad's,neutral
Best music app on the planet,positive
Toooo many ads,neutral
It's great yada yada... Please add a true shuffle that is equally random between every song as the already existing one is rigged,positive
"The best music app EVER, I got everything I need in just one app",positive
I love Spotify but it's always makes difficult to listen and I really hate that and there's always bags,negative
"Got a free 2 month premium trial from a friend and started getting ads after one month. Also, sound quality is inferior to Pandora.",negative
"After every song I would get about 3-4 ads. Features are very limited, limited skips, shuffle only overall a really bad app. I would reccomend only using the desktop version but ads are really incessant there too.",negative
It's much better than ganna app. J m really enjoying it,neutral
"Great app the ads are not bad at all,I love it 🥺❤️🤞so boring that you have to pay before you can download any songs 💔😓😭",positive
I love the content....but this app continually crashes. The podcast keeps playing but there is no way to stop it without closing the app completely. Been this way for months.,negative
"This may be a good app until I wanted to play a song, a specific one to say. But it always shows a ""suggested"" song that I dont want and I cant even stand it anymore so please fix this cause all we want is some music.",negative
I can renew my payment on this app with my Nigeria card and it annoying 😒,negative
"Can't even choose a song. If you select a specific song, the app will choose some other song for you.",negative
The mobile version of Spotify is currently unusable on my device. There isn't a way to play individual songs from a playlist or an album. The only upside is that podcasts work as expected.,negative
Doctor who and soundtracks mostly also I hop it free so far,positive
when it says free premium for a month it should mean free premium for a month not sign up for spotify premium that doesnt make sense and u shouldn't have to wait for skips and u need to remove songs we added i hate the songs you added,negative
Downloading a playlist only means you'll have the first 10 seconds of each song. Embarrassing. I switched to this after Google got rid of Google music. I guess nothing good exists anymore.,negative
Best music/podcast app ever,positive
Damn i hate spotify!! When i want to click my favourite it turns out a different song!!! UGH I GONNA UNINSTALL THIS APP SERIOUSLY MAKE ME ANGRY😡🙄,negative
Best music app out there! Joe Rogan for life!!,positive

"Occasional bugs here and there. Sometimes they fix them, sometimes they don't. At least not right away. Also bummed that, and I understand for legal reasons, there are some bands/albums/musicians that are not available.",neutral
"That last couple update have systematically broken the app. Connections to devices are buggy and intermittent. UI has broken a dozen times a day and won't respond, play anything, and when it does the wrong item will show as playing versus the sound. Can't skip what it doesn't know it's playing!.. Reinstall and restarts are no help. ""No internet connection"" even when I am on the god damn wifi and in a city. Straight up broken at the moment.",positive
please stop addding song that are not in my playlist. Its so annoying to listen to a song not on your playlist when you want to listen to YOUR playlist not what Spotify wants. I wish there was a option i tried everything and Nothing worked so PLEASE make it an option!,neutral
Brings me back to the olden days Junior High High School good music love it😎😊,positive

Constantly says I have no internet connection when I do,negative
"Took 3 payments from my account in 1 month , when I contacted them theysaid they couldn't refund me and I could cancel the app if I wished to do so and left it at that.... ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",negative
"After new update, i can't press lyric anymore to go to certain part of music. I hope u fix it back because that's the main reason I stick to Spotify beside deep integration with my Samsung phone.",positive
"You can't find out if the song you searched up is the one you want cause when you select it it plays literally any song, but the song you asked for",negative
"Best app in world!!! No issues with ads (comes only sometimes), network problem (never ever if you are having broadband) and song volume or quality... I love this app😍😍😍",positive
Too much pub,positive
Not sure how spotify manages to be a 7 billion dollar company and also an app that literally doesn't work half the time but I can't find an app like it so here we are,negative
"No ads, just music",positive
Best music player ever,positive
"Overall, I pay the $10 a month because I appreciate what the app provides. However, for $10 a month, it's a little irritating that the offline mode sometimes acts up and even though things are downloaded, the app can't access them.",positive
i cannot live without Spotify.,positive
"This app is great, it has (almost) every song I really enjoy. Def a 5 star rating",positive
Great app to listen bts song,positive

It just a good app in general but there are too many premium restrictions,positive
Too much ads now a days. So uninstalling the app.,negative

LIVE Spotify!!! I refuse to use any other music app. XOXO,positive
"It's not Spotify It's adsify. Ads will come even after you heard a single song, Full of ads, that is of 30sec..... Worst experience ever 🤧",negative
Good app for listening music but one problem creates that is sometimes you chose another music to listen in between ads are disturbing to you 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔.....,positive
"I give premium a 5 but the free version is kinda bad, They make you listen to a certain amount of songs then you have to wait to be able choose what song you want to listen to.",positive
Unexplainable. I'm extremely happy eith Spotify ever since i been introduced to it last year by a friend. I'm rating 5 🌟's,positive
Really like having limited ad's and they don't take up the whole screen.,positive
Good just long ads and to much ads I'll skip probably 1 so ng and I'll get about 3 to 4 ads,neutral
I love Spotify just Awesome ❤️,positive
Worst app i have ever used. When you try to login it shows that it has an issue try later and not even twice or thrice but always. Please Spotify either look after this or you will have trouble later.,negative
"I like it and although many people are complaining it works just fine the playlist will be ""blocked"" sometimes on some devices because of updates but if you make sure it is updated it is fine.",positive
Really good app for music lovers,positive
Amazing app with premium,positive
Wide array of beautiful music. Thank you,positive
Solid. Very enjoyable.,positive

Very nice music application,positive
I find my old tunes on Google and your right there to add awsome,positive

The Thunderstorm Podcast is what it is because of Spotify!! Anchor you're awesome!!!!,positive
Deleted. Started auto playing weird stuff. Turned off all auto play buttons but clearly not enough. There are better apps,negative
Super and nice songs to enjoy music,positive
Paid for the premium and enjoy the ease of use with no ads. Would give it 5 stars if the free version didn't have so many ads and you could select the song you want on your playlist rather than having to listen to it on random.,positive
"Not only does Spotify glitch, it also shuts down all apps 😐 even if I'm only running one app 😐 now I have to cancel my subscription because I can't use it as it's only connected to Spotify. But wait, I tried Spotify Lite so that I didn't waste my subscription.. same thing, just worse. Not even latest version works. More Bug Fixes Needed -Don't subscribe- How come there are ads in the podcast episodes when I've bought premium to avoid ads? Doesn't make much sense.",negative
"the ""we added"" feature thing is useless every single time you make a playlist with one song they just add more so you get less ""bored"" or stuff idk bruh this app is good but I wouldn't recommend making your own playlist",positive
This app has great sound quality and easy to use,positive
When I entered my Spotify my account all missed up and no longer showing or allowing me to access the Playlists I made or any artists and my favorite music's. Poor service 😡,negative
It's definitely a good but a little problem it's has only a little skips even thought you have premium and when i make my playlist the song is short,positive
It's pretty good but when your a free listener u get limited skips and u can't stay in the same Playlist like for example if I'm listing to boy with uke three songs later I get a whole new different song so can u please fix this?,positive
"So many ad disturbances kindly without premium, suggestion take the all problem seriously..thanks..",negative
Kept pausing for no reason so i tried to uninstall and then reinstall. Now the app won't open past the spotify logo. I have been a premium subscriber for years but now if this doesn't start working soon I'll have to try a different service. Very disappointing.,negative
Spotify is so cool,positive
This is the best app to listen to music and release you stress ❤🧡💛💚 I would use this app 24/7💯,positive
Such a best music experience but there are lots of ads,positive
I'm changing my review frome 5✨ to 3✨ just because they removed eisenfunks song called PONG,neutral
I love that I can make my own playlists and I also enjoy those created for me. Have found some new bands!,positive
As a consumer an a artist Spotify been good with innovation on algorithms. Pay could be better but they put my song in front of different audiences who now follow everywhere,positive
"Was reading some reviews and im quite disapointed, so many complains about skiping or ads or songs added to a playlist, please upgrade to premium. The COMPANY and the ARTISTS are not making any money from free accounts, and then you hear most complains from these individuals, if you cant afford it yet pls dont give 1 to 2 stars to an app that you are freeloading from. Our plan is spot family, P214($3.8) for 6 fam members, that is P36 ea person/ month. Doesnt even dent ur monthly income friends",positive
I like spotify it is good . Pls put new songs on it .,positive
I love that app but there is stuff like stupid stuff that you need vip and I don't want to pay to do this little things,positive
"Great price for a great service. Love, love, love",positive
Good song picks but hope the sound quality will be at par with Tidal in the future nevertheless sound quality is good. It also lacks EQ to make songs a bit of your personal tuning.,positive
Good selection of music and artist,positive
Best music experience!!!,positive
Love it . There when I'm In need of a familiar sound to match my mood,positive
That's so cool kinda app but its little bit weird ❤,positive
Awesome I love the music sound,positive
"Really good app, have had it for 5 years and has always been great. I listen to everything, sometimes Lags a bit but I think it's just down to the amount of tunes I have",positive
"I get to hear two songs, and then get 3 ads in a row, then I might be able to listen to 5 songs, but then get 4 ads in a row. When I first started using this app, I thought it was okay, but now all I seem to hear are ads, and suggested songs that I didn't add to any of my playlists. And why are they trying to get me to listen to country? I'm not a fan of that genre, but when I click the minus botton it plays 3 ads in a row. I know I'm one person, but this is really frustrating.",negative
"If I pay for an ad free experience, I expect my content to be ad free. Spotify double-dipping and forcing me to listen to ads on podcasts, even though I pay for a premium subscription, is a disappointing display of unnecessary greed. That coupled with the fact that downloadable, offline listening is a promised feature that almost NEVER works makes me wonder why I have a subscription in the first place.",negative
I can't open spotify. I've reinstalled a lot of time already and nothing.,negative
It keeps crashing n turning off.,negative
I am using Spotify premium and Podcasts are not working anymore. Big downgrade. Do sth about it and soon.,negative

Cannot fault Spotify. 💚,positive
It is a great overall experience with Spotify,positive
It's ok as an app to listen to music but the update made me review 4 stars,positive
This new update sucks. I wish the app was displayed on the notification bar so I could just scroll down and change or pause. It's a hassle to stop 1 app and go into Spotify then go back to original app. It should appear on lock screen as well.,neutral
I need help!!! My spotify NOT OPEN!!!! PLEASE.,negative
Refuses to work on my phone works fine on other devices have tried all steps to get it to work with zero success not good enough for something I pay for.,negative
"So much to receive with this app. Brings back so many memories ""even If I forgotten all about it the song remembers when""",positive
new update is hot trash. select library and it puts you immediately into your playlists. what happens if i don't use playlists? now you just added an extra step for no purpose. artists are now randomly listed. no alphabetical order. no rhyme or reason. I've downloaded these songs dozens of times and everytime they do another ill conceived update all songs are deleted yet again. albums are a disaster. no organization.,negative
Love all the music.... uninterrupted,positive
"One word describes spotify, AWESOME!",positive
"It's amazing, just bummer that you can't get songs that are only found on YouTube on Spotify but otherwise I like this app a lot",positive
"UI glitches sometimes. The screen will get stuck and show the same thing even when I switch the song. Also app totally crashed when trying to move from internal to external storage, so I had to reinstall it",neutral
Listening to my favorite artists and letting me branch out to find music everyday is the best experience. Always something new and I'm here for it,positive
Good service. Far too many bugs and annoying features.,negative
Almost no problems unlike YouTube music,positive

"Spotify rocks. I use premium and it's elite, love it more than Pandora for sure. Spotify makes it easy to listen to what you love and helps you explore! My music has expanded a lot thanks to Spotify. 10/10 would recommend.",positive
Really good selection of music,positive
I was having a great experience but near a year ago the app shut down so I had to reinstall it . I couldn't login into my ID even though every information was correct . I had to make new account and soon as I made it I was logged off . Now I'm using the Chrome version of it. Hoping the bugs can be fixed!,negative
Getting a bit glitchy not letting me skip the songs as a tab I have to go on to the app then it doesn't show me what song I'm listening 2 either,positive
Music access is fine but app is extremely buggy and often crashes,negative
And everytime i listen to the song it plays then it stops,negative
Switched from Live X a year and half ago and also had Apple Music. Spotify is the best.,positive
Hey my music don't play right it doesn't play it doesn't pause but when it does the bar at the bottom doesn't show and the bar on my notifications doesn't disappear and another bar on my notification keeps saying Spotify connections ??!!!!!!!!!!🤔😒,positive
I already disliked this app on mobile anyway but the experience i am having is souring my thoughts on it more. On console and desktop its awsone! But on mobile you really would use this. I repeatedly try to skip songs i already have hidden on the first place so they shouldnt play anway but they still do. And even if i hide a song i dont like it still plays which annoys me. You are better off using some other app than this on mobile. 0/10 if i could give it that rating.,negative
Best music streaming app you can find!,positive
"Spotify is my music source. With premium being so affordable, I don't have to listen to any other music platform, cause Spotify does everything possible. You can't find a reason not to put good vibes out there for their music platform. Get all your music needs from Spotify, they understand music. Good Job Spotify.",positive
It's all good and amazing and all but why I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is that I wish this app could switch accounts like yea so u could just change the acc like if there are 3 ppl and yea they don't have another device so i wish u could've just make accounts switch so yea I wish u could do that and yea otherwise 5/5 but pls make this happen 😉,positive
The app is great but now it is hard to find the song that I listen to more over all I love it I would have given it a 10/5,positive
Cant control phone volume from GW4. Have to come out of Spotify and then load up media controller to control phone volume,negative
"The amount you pay for premium is ridiculous, given that you have access to almost every song you want to find and that you can even download it to listen to it while offline.",positive
It says no internet connection available even though I am connected . Maybe there is no connection for another entity to manipulate the data packets that the manipulated music is attempting to inject. Just like the rest of the world. I wonder if you are liable for damages to people thought process,negative
Spotify is very good,positive
"It's nice because even if I don't have the paid for service I can still have music without it open on my screen unlike YouTube which not only wants me to keep my screen on but frequently pesters me if I'm still watching it. Which is very inconvenient for use while doing anything else at the same time, especially if I'm trying to wash dishes...",positive
Got pretty much all want in music not without exception though. Still the best there is in my opinion by a long shot.,positive
After new update... Only loading screen no song nothing,negative
Very annoying that every time I go to click my playlist it just freezes. It's good other then that,neutral
Throughout the years more and more things are taken away from free Spotify and made premium only. What a greedy app.,negative

Music cuts off here and there. This is from a premium subscriber,negative
Like the music but it is a pain that spotify auto connects every time I get in the car or on the bike. Even if I was listening to a podcast or some other music streaming service. Probably delete it before the week is out unless I find out how to stop it.,negative
"Worst place to listen to podcasts. Do not expect to pick up where you left off cause Spotify can't even get there timestamp right. Very glitchy all of the time and never works the same way twice, GOOD LUCK",negative
Stop adding suggested songs I hate it all I want is to listen to a rickroll AND I CANT I HAVE TO LISTEN TO STUPID SONGS fix this OR IM DELETING SPOTIFY FOREVER,negative
Easy to find what music you like.,positive

"better than Apple music, but it's a bit annoying that it gets you used to premium for the starting month, and then you're stuck with shuffle mode forever unless you purchase premium. other than that 10/10 edit: bro stop giving me three ads! im so done! and two of the ads are back to back the same thing. taking a star back",positive
Too many ads and some covers are not there,negative
Private sessions option should be permanent or has permanent private session option. And option to hide or remove recommend playlist.,positive
You should add a thing where if you like the playlist it likes all the songs for and you should make it give you premium for 1 year and then after that year it removes you from premium. Overall it is amazing.,positive
When I got to play a song it brings me to a playlist and I can't just enjoy song that I want to listen to it's annoying that they add random songs to my playlist and I can't skip them,negative

After new update its only 6 shuffle,positive
"its great ! a good music app, but the problem is, it has wayy TOO MUCH adds. its really annoying. i also cannot skip to the songs u want to hear, and limited 6 skips an hour. i can only preview songs too. also, sometimes when i'm listening to one of my playlists, random songs pop up, and they aren't even in my playlist. and aren't my type of music.",positive

Overall great music i would definitely say this is the best music app.,positive
Top one music ..but mention downloading option.,positive

This app is so annoying I make my Playlist and then it just adds random songs and I can't even delete them I deleted the app and going to find a new one,negative
"Previous update is worst! Songs are like music in a pirated cd that has glitched or ""jumping""! And now even in premium i cannot download songs after uninstalling and installing the apps. Like im paying for nothing. 🙄🙄🙄",negative
Always opens when connected to Bluetooth via vehicle. O select option not to auto start...still auto start. Would give 5 stars but this kills it for me.,negative
The app is good so far but I need to make use of it very well.,positive
Worst app ever I can't even sign into this app!! It tells me again and again that the combination of my email and password is incorrect !! Worst app!!😡,negative
Using this app since a year now but nowadays the quantity of advertisments are so maore means first I used to recommend people that they can use this app as the music quality is also great and not so much ads but now the ads are uncountable means after every 2 songs they will keep ads they are giving pressure to purchase premium.,negative
"This app is great. The only problem that I have with it is that it is really laggy. Some of my songs won't play will use my skips. Also, I'll use one skip and the app won't let me use any more of my skips. This was all a while ago but I thought I should let you guys know. I have premuin now and it works great.",positive
ALWAYS has great selection of Music to choose from.,positive
How to enable sing feature on Spotify?,neutral
Great for road trips and working! I enjoy making my own playlists as well as listening to the suggestions that Spotify comes up with based on my previous plays. The family membership helps cut costs as well. I can share music with my husband and vice versa!,positive
Why does this application always stop suddenly? I was enjoying the song and it kept stopping? Please fix this issue. Thank you.,negative

Music lovers biggest fan. Spotify doesn't mess around when it comes to music.,positive
They add songs to my playlists and I can't even find them on the playlists anymore so I'm stuck listening to songs I hate and I can't skip them because not only do I have a limited amount of skips but it'll also skip to more songs I can't find on the playlists so I can't edit them out.,positive
The ads are too much. I have to listen to atleast 1:30 minutes of ads and it kind of annoying. Please do something about it,neutral
"Fabulous. Bye bye CD, LP & cassette collection of 1,000+ albums, hello unlimited music 🤘🤘",positive
It is a very nice app and I even saw versions of songs I didn't knew were there example tik tok,positive
"It keeps popping ""Your offline"" even tho my internet access is strong",positive
"So far, so good! If Spotify would be open for suggestions, consider partnership with a strong online startup specializing in providing ACCURATE instrumental score to the songs WE, your customers, listen to. (I'm sure a creative mind would see this and take it to the team.)",positive
Easy to navigate. Not too many ads.,positive
"So much music, not enough time",positive
My always go to app ... Loved every feature of it... Only thing I hate is ads... but other than that everything is perfect..,positive
It's an amazing app but sometimes it randomly turns off the music it self while i am writing something (texting someone),positive
"This was so amazing until the new update. I'm really disappointed from this app,any song I want to play I can't play, they play different songs from that playlist it's really irritating the new update of this app is making me sick. I'll surely uninstall it if they keep on doing this to me. We can't skip more than 6 times per hour just because we didn't buy the premier that's really rude. Clear all the issue asap. I don't even want to give 1 star because of it's functions but it's necessary :))",negative
Ada are not related to anything I'd be interested in at all but with premium the app is amazing.,positive
"Like it, is good shows lyrics, but kina bad that u can't individually download songs",neutral

Worst music app ever in the history!! Ads per every 2 songs. Uninstalling it!,negative
Please Remove Episode For You (podcast) from Spotify Home Page.,positive
Not sure I'm really ok with artists not being paid appropriately to access their work. It is very handy though to download playlists to use in the car.,positive
"While ads are indeed annoying, the most annoying thing on this app is that it adds songs to your playlists without allowing you to remove them. I've tried hiding the songs but nothing works. Not only that but the limited skips are a true pain to many users who can't get premium.",negative
Amazing experience but too adds,positive
Easy to use and great parental settings,positive
This is a good app for songs and podcast but tgere was a issue in the miniplayer on the notification bar. It was showing multiple screens at a time but I fixed it by changing the app notification settings from my phone settings.,positive
Excellent but too many advertisement,positive
Excellent app took a while to understand how to use no problems now,positive
My music skips like a broken cd. Still skips like a scratched cd ugh. I pay too much for these issues.,negative

local files cannot ne read anymore. please fix.,positive
"You cannot subscribe via mobile load. The support said ""it shouldn't take long"" and it's already been a week.",negative
The best ! Very pleased with the app,positive
I've been listening to music with Spotify for well over a decade. It's been really cool watching it grow into the app I now know and love. It's super helpful that I can search for songs by lyrics and song recognization. I do wish the player would automatically show up in my push notifications like it used to on my old phone but I think that's more of a design flaw in my new device's software.,positive
Love the variety of music 🎶,positive
Excellent sound effect,positive
"Why is controlling spotify on my pc from my phone so broken now, what are we even paying for?",negative
I keep my Spotify updated but it keeps messing up and won't load my Playlist so I'm paying for a horrible service,negative

"It is not showing lyrics in my phone ,,,. Now its good 👍",positive
Always getting ads,negative
"App glitches when running in the background and if you pause with the Bluetooth command, you can't play unless you open the app. Sometimes podcasts pause for no reason. Sometimes the podcast keeps playing, but the ""command bar"" at the bottom disappears and you can't go back or pause. For all these reasons the app has to be closed and reopened frequently. This has been an issue forever now and I don't think the dev team will ever fix it.",negative
Easy to use. Love it!,positive
Please add high resolution audio support...the app is super laggy...and slow.,negative
"The app is epic. I don't mind the ads. I just need one thing added and I'd give a 5 start rating no doubt. A personalisation option to change the background in the profile to any default color options like blue, purple, green etc, instead of the default ones, which most of the time don't match with many users' profile pictures. Please try to add this feature",neutral
This is the best app... But there is so much ad,positive
Ads after every 2 songs is ridiculous. I know you want people to pay for premium but this makes me want to get pandora again and pay for that.,negative
It's not visible in my app section and when I try to play a music it plays another one so that's why I gave it 3 star but it's such a beautiful app for song love it,neutral
It is a amazing but the playlist i want is not available,positive
Not working on Samsung S21 Ultra,negative
Spotify makes it's so much harder to listen to my fav songs or playlist. The new update is just trush i wanna play song playlist in order but it's just automatically shuffles. Plus when i tried to listen to my playlist i hear songs i didn't even added. Spotify just wants your money at this point,negative
Simple and functional app.,positive
Remove this listenin on ........ popup. We cant search a song.,negative
"Spotify, honestly, is one of the greatest platforms out there for music. Basically all I have to say, nothing more to it.",positive
"Spotify wrapped is fire and Spotify in general just works very well. I like the enhanced option they added a while back and the lyric & syncing they added is nice. A lot of songs don't have lyric data available though, and even then some don't have syncing data. Still, great app and platform to find and listen to music. Get on a family plan with your friends",positive
"Fix the glitch where if you like a song without actually clicking it to make it play, it doesn't actually add to your liked songs. The heart will fill green and appear so but if you go into album and play song, it's not filled green or 'liked'",positive
I keep having to reinstall. App will not function normally for over a month. It plays with the button on pause and there is no way to stop it besides force stop...or uninstall. I pay for premium. About to change to another app.,negative
"Where did the sing mode go, it was really fun!",positive
Very high quality music,positive
Seamless music and podcast streaming!,positive
Very nice good work but remove those ads,positive
Terrible spotify just wants to take your money and make you go premium for only a month you can only listen to your music without going premium on your computer you can't listen to it on the go.,negative
"Very easy to use, and I just love it. Plenty of music to play!",positive
"Why on earth have you taken a perfectly functional feature like Group sessions and made it worse? You've removed the ability to scan codes, which means when meeting new people I now have to somehow send them a link. You now default to playing music on all devices when I just want the music to come out of the one connected to the speakers. I don't get it, these changes are asinine. Whoever approved these changes need to be fired and you lot need to find the undo button.",negative
"Phone broken, bought new one, install Spotify and it won't play songs. My library is on home screen but not in library. Want my subscription money back. Plays on wife's phone but not mine, in fact every time I start Spotify it starts on her phone. Guess you idiots don't even look at these.",negative
"Ok I'd probably give it a 5 star if it wasn't for the randomly suggested songs, just please stop suggesting me songs",positive
"Good choice if music but it constantly adds random songs to my playlist which I find very annoying and when I'm trying to listen to a song it plays a different song by the same artist or a whole different song that I covered earlier, adds itself",negative
The app works pretty much as you'd expect--missing some functionality but at the expense of convenience. And yeah it's bad they don't pay their creators hardly anything. But do you know what's criminal about this app? The fact that even if your liked songs are downloaded AND you have a good enough connection to the Internet (which shouldn't even be required if the songs are already stored locally) you CANNOT load your liked songs. You have about a fifty percent chance to access it at any point,neutral
Great sound quality and a wide range of music suggestions offered.,positive

Now the app keeps saying there is no internet connection despite there being connection and all my songs are missing from the list. What are you people doing over there? And I'm a bloody premium member. Getting sick and tired of this.",negative
This app is complete trash. Other apps that provide the same service are much more useful than spotify,negative

Hope to be a free app :'( or make it to have a less advertisement,positive
"This app LOVES to stop playing randomly. Do you enjoy listening to music or a podcast? Hopefully you enjoy either one stopping on a dime for no reason at all...because it will. Whether on Bluetooth or not, be prepared for your listening experience to be interrupted by total silence on a regular basis. You'll have to pick up your phone to open the the app and restart it manually. This becomes impossible if you're driving. I've done everything i can to remedy this to no avail. Please fix!",negative
Im really enjoying Spotify,positive
Amazing for podcast 👍❤️ Quality level is Best 👍☺️,positive
"I used have music while I was driving. Now I can't have music or there'll be an accident from constantly having to make sure my screen is on 24/7 like this is YouTube music. I downloaded this because I wanted to listen to music while I drive, not be a mayhem. And I do a lot of driving. So now it's just been empty space in my car for almost a year. So no 5 stars definitely until its fixed. It's a problem you don't care about I know. You have a radio. Just go home and listen then. Not the point.",positive

Each time I make a play list it always adds damn song that I don't want to listen to and I can't remove them and that's why i rate it a 1/5,negative

"this app is great and paying for premium was absolutely worth it, but i have two issues: 1. equalization, there is no place to adjust bass or treble and i that makes me prefer other music apps sometimes. 2. shuffling, the shuffle option in spotify does not work correctly and normally dumps similar songs next to eachother, which is inconvenient. other than that it's an amazing app and would definitely recommend for streaming and downloading music on your phone, computer, tv etc.",positive
I had no problems with Spotify until a few days ago.. I used to link it to set my alarm but now it's not qorking the same.. Fix that issue and it's one of the best music apps ever....,positive
"Hey plz make some shortcuts to like any song, add to queue, etc You have shortcuts for adding to queue for ""today's top hits"" section but that doesn't work on songs when u open any album of any artist.

Also plz add feature to customize home so that we can always add our favorite artist or any segment like ""TTH"" to that place After these features app is gonna be almost perfect.",neutral
"A good app for streaming music. My only issue is the Equaliser is not easily accessible. You need to go to Settings and scroll right down to find it.

"This version its worse you cant play a song,The old version is better than this please change for us if not you are going to lose,its becoming worse",negative
I'm using spotify as a premium member since multiple years on multiple different devices. Experience with this app is getting worse every day. Here's a collection of issues I had so far on Android (as I said it seems to be getting worse by the day) - crashes - freezes - random redownloading of your already downloaded music - wacky behavior when in offline mode - randomly starting to play music even if you don't want to - not showing the correct song - not being able to stop a song,negative

Very easy to find any song you like no matter how old it is,positive
I really like spotify but only because i bought premimum,positive
"When searching in ""your library"" it no longer shows playlists, it just shows artists. I want to look for my playlists under my library, not artists please change it back (4 updates later & it's still not fixed). And please stop pushing podcasts on the home screen, I never listen to them and even after selecting 'not interested in this show' the same show appears again. In fact 80% of the home page is recommendations that I will never click on, making it pointless and not worth checking.",negative

It shuffles into other song instead of the song I'm looking for,negative
Umm it was great before but currently there's too much ads and the limited skips are kinda annoying.... Overall it's pretty decent ( might be better idk ) compared to other music apps,neutral
It gives me so many options i just feel like 10 skips an hour would be a major plus.,positive
Personalization is their Forte love having Playlists designed just for me!!! DAILY,positive
"I can always get to music I enjoy provided I have signal. Been using the app for years, been using premium and it's entirely worth every cent. The only thing that gets annoying is that the songs I use the feature to ignore/skip still will play when I'm playing albums and I have to skip them manually. Love the songs the personalized albums come up with though.",positive
"It be pretty aight if you don't skimp the premium downloads go by quick on not the best internet so you don't need a GOATED or God CPU ETC, ETC bing bong £u€k ya life™",positive
"It's a good music app for Samsung's and Android, if you buy/get the family plane then you don't get the aids",positive
"Updating my review to say it's still great. Only issue is large playlists seem to have issues shuffling, sometimes just play the same 60 or so songs.",positive
There Are Lot Of Songs & Playlists To Listen.....Really An Good App🎧,positive
"Why is it that we pay for premium but still get ads for every page on the app? Who gives any about podcasts?? Seriously, we aren't paying for a new set of advertisements. Maybe try listening to your consumers? It has also been glitching lately as well... it is the only app that will not connect to the internet.",negative
Nice to listen to music while just walking,positive
"All features are good except the problem of showing no internet connection while searching a song even when there is good internet connection, i think this issue is faced by many users.",neutral
It's so great I love it so much I have no complaints,positive
Good suggestions. Great dance music options when it gets me in the moose,positive

Very useful application form song,negative
The ad experience is horrific and if I make a playlist containing 20 or so songs I'm lucky if I get to hear a single 1 from it I used use this app exclusively and now its unbearable,negative
It made me have to log back in and now if won't let me log back in,negative
The best music application there is.,positive

If they fix this I will bring it to 5 stars but right now, it's 2 stars",negative
I love this app. It has so many genres to pick from. So many songs to chose and you can follow your friends and listen to there playlist. I like how for instance Salish Matter isn't like Drake but you can still listen to her music. ❤,positive
"Hi, I just start using it and till now it is great, thanks",positive
Very easy to use and handy when ant got any data,positive
It's become really annoying to have to always restart the app so I can see what song is playing on the home screen. Even then it doesn't show up. I just expect more from an app I pay for. It's super inconvenient and I use this app all day everyday. Please see to fixing these bugs Spotify.,positive
"too much ads, hate it",neutral
"Spotify free used to work normal with ads. After purchasing premium, search results, song selection, literally any action keeps the app loading forever !",negative
It's cool with premium but without it I can't even select songs without premium.,negative
"Great music app with variety selection of songs. Also, user-friendly operation to your own liking.",positive
Great music app I love it I highly recommend it 👍,positive
Most entertaining and user friendly good app...,positive
"It's always been a great streaming service. I've let my subscription cancel for years and come back to my same massive library, fully intact.",positive
The podcasting has been pretty bad with losing your place and altogether skipping to the end when you try to start it up making it completely un enjoyable for me to the point where I didn't listen but something seems to have changed in the last few days and things have worked normally so whatever you guys might have done good job,positive
I've used this app for about a month now and I'm 99% happy with it. Every now and then there are little glitches but they are easily fixed. Much better than Amazon music!,positive
"Awesome experience with Spotify, try it it's really amazing 😎😄",positive
"COVID warnings on podcasts now?? Are you kidding? 2+ years later? Now? Super LAME!! Download a podcast to play later, forget about it. Why? Because you NEED AN INTERNET CONNECTION!? Huh?? If it wasn't for Joe Rogan, I'd have bailed on this app a long time ago. it's so glitchy, unreliable, counterintuitive, stupid warnings. I have to force close it constantly & restart and sometimes it jumps to a totally random podcast maybe even a year old??",negative
"I don't know about the paid version; ask someone else about that. As for the free version, way too many ads to even think about enjoying music, not to mention all the politically correct podcasts and musicians. Uninstall...",negative
I like the app. But why have you been restricting Neil Young songs?,positive
Very enjoyable and easy to use,positive
"what happened to ads every other 30 minutes. Now it's ads every 4-5 songs. So damn annoying dude. Please consider adding less ads, or some kind of solution. Thanks.",negative
"I love it the only thing is that I wish the UI/UX was more fluid and less boxy, and I wish that I could DISABLE lyrics instead of always having it on",positive
It is the best app for good music 🎶 like it that why agive it five stars 🌟,positive
"Hope to learn how to go along singing, wonderful. Thank you so much.",positive
love listening to music while I walk,positive
This use to be a great app but there is way too many ads between songs. 1 or 2 is fine for the free version but 6 or 7 is ridiculous. I will be searching for a new music app unfortunately,negative
good app latest & Old song,positive
"to me spotify is so easy,with a robust library from old to new and all genres,i just absolutely must have it every day",positive
"Well, it continously says offline and to get online to listen to anything. I am online....🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️😒",negative

I've enjoyedspotifymostly(beenGreatly annoyedattimesAlso) for years once I figured out how to makemy ownPlaylists.I was no longer at the mercy of shuffle play unlessIwabted2b and could also key queuefrom playlists made. Have you consider making then dnlg list,then go offline to listen. Sometimes its the best way. My only gripe isIwish there was a automatic filter that wouldnt allow me to DLsONGS I've already DL!! That would make my life 4000+ songs ALOT better",positive
Great app has all of my favorite music choices,positive
Love it's to listen the music I Want,positive
I really like the app just that the ads can be really disruptive. But you can make playlists for you and your friends so I say its a pretty nice app.,positive

"Love the app..the lyrics viewer just got an update which makes the experience so much better..another feature I would really like spotify to adopt and I especially think it will change the way people use Spotify drastically is the addition of videos, I know it may be a very difficult thing to do but if it's possible I hope it can be done in the future and also when is the long awaited HiFi audio features coming.",positive
Love this app.. but why is it everytime I'm in my feels listening to sad music a ad comes on atp I don't even wanna cry anymore u ruined it. U guys are like listening to me cry it seems like it 😻.,positive
Premium here. It works well ... For about 10 seconds per song.,negative
"I get the whole advertisement but at this point you're overdoing it. I only hear about three to two songs and then I hear about 5 ads, are you kidding me?? Two songs and in-between there's two ads Chill out with the advertising it's really difficult for me to enjoy your damn app and I'm a teenager so I can't afford your premium but at least give us a break from the advertising. I hear more ads than music my god",neutral
It's perfect on my watch Samsung Galaxy watch for classic,positive
I am using for almost a year but i dont know how to listen offline music after get downloaded ?,negative
"I like the newly added recommendations being played through your history list songs after they've ended. It's a nice touch and a good way to find new music. Please don't kill this feature, it'll be very disappointing, I honestly don't mind not having the history list play by song.",positive
The audio of the songs is not consistent. Some are too soft i can hardly hear.,negative
I love Spotify the music is endless and so worth the subscription!,positive
Gives great music at touch of a button,positive
I didn't realize until it went away that it starts you off with a free sample of premium. I liked the app until premium went away. Now you can't even pick the songs you want. You can only shuffle playlists. And if you try making your own Playlist Spotify adds songs to it that have nothing to do with the ones you added yourself. Over all I'm very disappointed with my experience with this app. It's pretty cool with premium but the free version is disappointing.,negative
"I like your 30 mins uninterrupted, but its hard to enjoy when you software runs with the processing power of a 2 year old with down syndrome! Take a lesson from YouTube and actually play what people search for!",negative
Absolutely useless !!!!! App is permanently offline which makes it useless and unusable !!!!! Why even present this app if it doesn't not work !!!! I was recommended to use Spotify by many colleagues I respect !!! But now I wonder !!!! Don't know if you can help or not but I will change my attitude if help does fix the problem 😶,negative
Music galore! Would be better if you fixed the equalizer,negative
Very useful in a quite time,positive
"Spotify is an excellent music app,i just love this",positive
"I rate spotify 3 stars because I loved it, I enjoyed it. if not because Im not able to play my downloaded songs while offline even if im on premium, I could have been given them 5 stars. because of this, i just undo my subscription",positive
"Spotify is literally the best. You can listen to any song you want and it's better than the competition. Only downside is the 4 advertisements that play every 15 minutes. Other than that though, Spotify is great.",positive
"Good app, yet recently I've noticed that alot of my songs are being removed for some reason? Would like to know why please.",positive
Spotify is spot on,positive
Great for podcast and mostly all music highly recommend,positive
Yes I would write you a fight cuz I love Spotify but since I got premium for almost a year now y'all have taken two payments off of my card,positive
"Want to listen to a song? Too bad, you have to pay to listen to what you want to hear. Otherwise have this playlist of 90 songs and pray the one you want to hear shows up! Don't wanna hear ads between songs without paying an arm and a leg? Tough luck buddy! Avoid at all costs.",negative
"I find this app ok, to many freaking ads though 🙄",neutral
"I had Spotify for years now and I was always very happy with it. Now for the first time in my life I have Spotify without premium and it is the biggest piece of s*** I have ever encountered. I would give it 0 stars or less, but with premium it is actually very good so two stars.",negative
Ads are annoying but other than that it's fine,positive
"Don't add songs to my custom Playlist that I put my songs on, I make custom Playlists because I want to only hear the songs on said Playlist not what you recommend to me",negative
This app is the best app in the sector of free streaming of music and audio!! Though sometimes you may get several ads but you can purchase an individual premium plan for just 119 per month which is reasonable.And the quality of sound is of top quality! This app is unbeatable.I love this app and using since 2020.🤗,positive
Alot of my playlist is not downloading,neutral
"Best music app. I've been using it for about 2 or 3 years and it's been great. The ads are kind of a problem but it doesn't really bother me. I hate that there's only 6 skips per hour. But the app is still great. Has all the music i look up. Country, rap, all the stuff I love. 10/10",positive
I love this spotify app but the adds are more,neutral
Awesome to listen to my favorite music anytime!,positive
Okay Spotify if its free thin you guys need to stick to that no b.s with limited skips really in my opinion Spotify needs to be pulled off the app store just because of how messed up Spotify is it plays songs I have no interest in and the add wall is so bad I only use it for my xbox,negative
Plays and adds random music that you can't get rid of. Won't let me play the songs I wanna play. I hate the new version,neutral
Get to listen to my music which is perfect,positive
For whatever reason I can't scroll to see the different genres/moods for my liked songs.,positive
Wonderful music to work by and easy to select tunes and artist that I enjoy the most. Great variety,positive
"Awesome, but 3 stars for a few reasons; 1. App crashes consistently on my phone. 2. I have to wait a hour just to get 6 skips. 3. Umm.. No third reason but three stars is my rating",neutral
An update of the app took it all away. Will uninstall.,negative

Most of the play list are fake/false. Like u search for lets say linkin park andthe playlist named literally linkin park is having every kind of songs but linkinpark. Waste of money,negative
Love how i get two back to back ads ... like why?,negative
"Normally I would put 5 stars as I love Spotify. But while I thought the issue had been fixed, I updated the app today and once again, while connected to any Bluetooth device, my music is stopping randomly, multiple times, on EVERY SINGLE song. It's not an issue with my phone as I do not have this issue with any other media streaming app, and it's not the Bluetooth device because it happens on multiple devices. Please fix this.",positive
Tbh i have a few suggestions to the app But i love how you can watch 3 ads to get 30 minutes free listening i love that Ill update my comment and ill add the suggestions later.,positive
Recent updates have made the app completely useless for a month now even though I'm paying for the service. It won't load anything or play anything. Pretty disappointed from a service I use daily.,negative
I've spent years building a playlist and all of them are gone now. I was first a free user and have been on the paid family plan for the last year. Everything is gone since the last two updates and I can't use it at all. Edit: I discovered the app works on Roku but not my android phone. I obviously can't use my Roku in the car! Please fix it!,negative
"I get not being able to do some things but some are just ridiculous, heres a list . 1- not being able to choose a song on a playlist 2- not being able to chance the second of the song 3 cant go back to the song before 4 NO QUEUE 5 limited skips 6 CANT REPLAY A SONG??? 6 being stuck with randomizer on 7 WHY DOES IT PLAY RANDOM SONGS BRO THEYRE NOT EVEN ON MY PLAYLIST ???",negative
STOP WITH THE ADDS AFTER EVERY SONG! Fair enough every 30mins. BUT. EVERY. SONG. Is an overkill. Be a bit considerate for those of of who are clearly trying to budget with not spending $110/year for music.,negative
"app just suddenly ceased to work properly, can't even browse or play any songs (samsung galaxy s9 plus)",negative
"Spotify is great and I don't mind ads every once in awhile but the ads are starting to get excessive. I swear it feels like I'll listen to three songs and get three ads after. Sometimes even after the ""30 mins of uninterrupted listening"" ad I'll get an ad two songs later.",positive
This is just an amazing platform that gives you variety and Platform Church (Rested Life) content everything is in it and our members love it.,positive
"Bots add thing to ur playlist. Cant even play a regular song u searched up, it just puts a random song on you dont like. I miss the old spotify.",negative
I like the app it's a good music app but I find the library limited when compared to YouTube mother or less commercial breaks and for shorter time. I never look at Spotify before but clearly they're more options comparing the two music platforms it's like apples and oranges give it a shot tell me what you think,positive
You can't play specific songs unless you pay. You can get free alternatives so don't shill for some big corporation - there are better ways to support smaller artists.,negative
I can't play some 8d music. It sucks,neutral

Keep cranking out the tunes, we'll keep listening.",positive

I love spotify and I have been listening music on it for several months but nowadays the app just stops working while a song is playing or you click on a artist and the music pauses.

"2/5 because of the inability to delete your recently played history now. Edit 1/5 because now you can't even choose what song in your playlist to play, you can't reorder your songs, AND you have limited skips?! I fail to understand your reasoning. The ads haven't bothered me (yet) but should it I would rate this 0 stars if I could, only redeeming factor is the quantity of songs, opposed to the quality of the app.",negative
"I want to know what happend the collaborative button because now i cant add songs on others people's playlist. I updated it many times but the collabrative button wont pop up, and also can you guys put a spotify chat system on there its gettin really boring trying to talk by putting songs on other people's playlist Overall its great.",positive
"One of the best music apps. Hiding songs plays them anyway, so what's the point of that feature? Song categories are getting ridiculous but what can we expect in this new world.",positive
"Myself, I enjoy sitting and listening to the old time radio stories from my childhood.",positive
Too many adds,negative
"Music is my life and I mean to find almost every single song I want is absolutely awesome. Great job and and awesome effort to keep Spotify up to date, thx Spotify team💪🏼🔥",positive
Spotify is not the app is literally like when you click to play your playlist it's not like how it used to be now just generates on some random song and it's not fun I can't start from the beginning and it limits how many songs you can swipe you can only do six per hour why Spotify tell me cuz this is not making sense like I downloaded this app to listen to music but now I can't and I don't like the app anymore that's why I give the one star cuz of this Spotify needs to update their pictures,negative
I love the app but i hate when i play a song it gives me another song of the same creator its really annoying,positive
I had used iheart radio for years. I will no longer use iheart due to them pushing their GAY agenda on their users. I got tired of gay ads every 10 minutes. I switched to Spotify and hope they are better.,positive
"The best app ever, i wish the premium would be cheaper but I just can't live without it",positive
"I listen to podcast everyday, worth the family subscription",positive
"Annoying that it starts playing randomly in my car. It auto starts when I turn my car on, when I answer a call, when I hang up, when I turn my stereo on, etc. If I turn off permissions to avoid this then it doesn't work properly. Like the service, hate the app.",negative
"Great app, but the removal of car integration sucks. You had a feature that worked well, for tons of people, and removed it just to push your own hardware, screwing over everyone.",positive
"such a good app, with or without premium they have lots of songs and i know it can be a little annoying when spotify adds songs to your playlist but the songs they add are based off your recent searches so theyre not even bad songs and at least when you watch and ad you get rewarded with 30 mins of uninterupted listening! they have basically every song. such a great app... and its free too!",positive
Living below the poverty level and getting to listen to the vast collection available for free is wonderful. Sure I'd like the perks of membership but I can deal with having way less ads than radio ever had.,positive
I wish I could date my Spotify playlist,positive
"My music sometimes turns off even when my sleep timer isn't set, but not often. I really like the app, but it's unfortunate that we must pay so much to access premium features. I guess $5 would be alright, but $10 for just music seems like a lot. Even streaming services like Disney+ charge less, but the premium features are still nice (I got it so I could download my music to listen to when I travel).",positive
I love to play Spotify 😊😊 🎧,positive
Updates use too much data.,negative
Fantastic a great mix of everything and anything.... Tunetastic,positive
"The leader in its field, top quality app.",positive

"Better than Apple itunes by far. More music different styles of music 🎶 absolutely worth $9.99 a month I don't listen to my radio or pay for XM radio when I can listen to anything without commercials and radio talk. I like apple music. But nothing beats"" Spotify""!!!!",positive
One of the most favourite application but now it's the most worst app and I hate it. Always keep saying no internet connection blah blah. No songs play. Why? Very disappointing. Never expect this from this app. It's quite famous and I think popularity makes people blind.,negative
This is the best app to listen to music to,positive
"Nice, got my lyrics. Thanks",positive
Paid accounts still have advertisements on podcasts,positive
Excellent musical choices!,positive
Never had any issues. Music is always current and I like that there is a wide variety to choose from.,positive
Want better tamil lyrics in both english and Tamil. Sometimes autoplay song genre based on search is unrelated. Ad appearing in between two songs is quite hindrance,neutral
I do love this app for all of my music. Except for the fact that if you don't pay you don't get the premium which means you don't get anything that you want. You have unlimited number of skips for the premium and you don't with the free version. I can make my own playlist with a premiums can't with regular. I guess it is worth the $9.99 to get the premium. Unless you don't use it as much as I do which is everyday.,positive
It doesn't working says run time exception many times I have deleted and reinstall it then also it's saying than useless app,negative
Why can't u just send password reset? U send to email and I only can open email in my phone. Cannot use other devices,negative
I love spotify I've been using it for something around 3-4 years and have personally not really had any problems and I use this app almost everyday it's easy to use you can find some really good artists and songs just by listening to your discover weekly which recommends you songs based off what you have been listening to,positive
I used to have pandora but switched to this and never looked back highly recommend switching💯👌,positive
"Premium user. Managed to somehow turn car mode back on in settings on my previous phone, now it's greyed out and there is no SAFE driving option. Horrible planning on their part to discontinue car mode before having a replacement ready. Another issue is shuffle, I'll have hours of music in a playlist and it still plays multiple songs from one artist. Also wish I was recommended better music, rarely find something new I like in Discover Weekly.",neutral
All songs all the time but without premium the ads are a little bit annoying,positive
Best streaming online app for music and your favourite artiste.,positive
Great music selection and very easy to navigate,positive

Really good for music. No bofering for me.,positive

"I enjoy listening to podcasts, but the app has problems. It keeps locking up and closing on my Galaxy 22, and listening to downloaded content. Primarily having to switch between listening Online and Offline. I live in the sticks and do not have good cell service or wifi at home & listen to podcasts. There is absolutely no possible reason I should have to switch between modes to listen to content I have downloaded to device! I paid for service so I would be able to download & listen.",negative
"ABSOLUTE TRASH ON MOBILE. All I wanted to do was make a Playlist of 4 songs and play it. Didn't even play a single song of mine and just kept playing random ""similar"" songs, song after song. After I had to waste time googling for a fix. Found the fix and turned off ""autoplay similar songs."" Still didn't play my Playlist songs. TRASH ON MOBILE. Not to mention I remade the Playlist from scratch about 5 times and it still didn't play a single song of mine.",negative
"I miss linear notes, cover art, lyrics (like real ones, not autotech guessing), bios (accurate), musicians, vocal, producing credits and please get rid of the fake albums for which none of the songs are available to hear. Other than that, and the constant glitches in sound, it's just dandy.",negative
It's a good app and i would have given 5 stars but after new update my Spotify is stuck at Spotify logo whenever I launch application.Developers pls fix this as soon as possible,negative
There should be an option to remove songs which we don't like from auto generated playlists.,neutral
As some songs are not available at it so m giving it 4 stars and hope u gonna fix it asap.. ≥﹏≤,positive

Works well in car and car picked up via bloothtooth automatically.,positive
This is a star I gave him a lot Why can't I listen to it in Iran? Then your countries start pondering and say freedom and ...? Then we can not listen to our country?..A student ... teenager ... you do not value us listening to our favorite songs because we are from Iran... Do you think we love ourselves here?We are in pain but we do not have the right to speak ... This is just music ....Do you really take this from us?,negative
enjoying listening music.,positive
Overall the app is very good but we cant downlaod the song without premium if you remove thing your rating got 4.8,neutral
Spotify is a joy to use. I love the playlists it automatically generates. The playlists are based on the type of songs you listen to. This introduces you to other artists you might not have heard of. You can also create your own playlists.,positive
Hi thanks my enjoying times o.k. function great my system I use stops two day after heat resistance? Cool,positive
"Lost without this app. I have more access to any music and podcasts than ever , part of my life now",positive

Sound quality is decreasing...,neutral
"I used to love Spotify but now I kill it weekly. If I don't reinstall, the platform does work as it once did. My main grump is that I can't fast forward 15 seconds on podcasts after a while. I have to clear data just to revive the function",neutral
Well.......what.....to....say.....about this app it's great as you all know and heard of. For the ones who are K-POP fans it's great for them.....❤️❤️😘,positive
I use spotify everyday and keep adding to my playlist! Limited ads and I easily find artist and songs. Highly recommend this app!!,positive

"perfect for anyone who wants to listen to podcasts and music free with ads. my only problem being it will sometimes not let me log in, but this is rare",positive
So many issues with the app.. I ve had spotify for years but seriously this is getting annoying. Also the 'spotify community' page is an absolute joke. Someone just replies with the classic clean re install 'solution' and marks it as solved. I have 40 GBS of music.. if I have to re download one more time I swear I am gonna lose it.,negative
The sound is very clear.,positive
"It's the go to app for music. The swipe gesture was a long awaited and great addition. It would be worth 5 stars, but I have unliked songs too many times accidentally due to the position of the like button. If it were only visible inside the player it would mean less accidental touches.",positive
Simply simply lovely.,positive
"Solid expirence, high quality music listening.",positive
Why is there no repeat button???,positive
Love being able to travel intimate to whatever decade I'm feeling atvthe moment!,positive

"Very excellent app, it gives me the collection of my pet music, thanx spotify.",positive
I like the fact that you can find so much music but there is sooo much to dislike like the fact that I can't choose what to listen to and every thing is shuffled and I can't listen to whatever I want and if I put one music in a playlist to listen to it They add music out of no where its annoying,negative
"I found an asian language song that had been searching for a year since ain't knew the language,but finally found it through Spotify 😍🤩 using another app. Giving 5 star🤩🤩😻😻😻",positive

"It would be great if App supports a feature to add a song as ”Play Next"". Apart from that it was Top Class.",positive
"Excellent variety of music tracks, nothing you search you can't find ! I love this app",positive
I am a collage student and i can't afford premium even after the discount and I get it that it is trying to push its customers towards buying premium but the number of ads are getting outrageous nowadays. Mocking your free user isn't going to get them buy premium it will just push them away. It has now become an app which is just insensitive towards poor people,negative

Easy and clear to use for music. Don't listen to Joe Rogan. I use Spotify everyday I love it.,positive
"Spotify changed my whole world after my son told me about it years ago. What? They have full albums? They have albums from the 70's?? Tears were shed as I would have a musical memory, do a quick search, and bam! The Best of Bread, Twin Sons of Different Mothers, Rumours --it doesn't get any better than this. Totally worth it people.💗💗💗",positive
Last update ruined playback. Pocast keeps stopping for no reason.,negative
I feel like there's a new update every other day. Whenever I got to use the app it either closes itself or just doesn't play music. Then I checked and.... surprise... another update. Sometimes I don't have the time to download the update and so I just have to be music less. So annoying.,neutral

"Update 30/06/22 - I've been a Premium user now since October '21 and it has been an awesome ride of discovery and rediscovery across the musical spectrum for me! If you have the change, try out Spotify and you won't regret it because it's worth every penny in my view. There are plenty of lesser known artists in this that mainstream is absolutely clueless about which is good of Spotify to include in their catalogue.

I enjoy this App. It has so many options and is easy to use,positive
"The app's great! Just like I heard it. Infact, it had almost all the musics and podcasts I just needed.. All I had an issue with is this - When a playing song ends, the 'notification' for the song disappears and the next song doesn't play.. I've recently updated Spotify but it doesn't work, I manually need to change the song each time one ends (Which gets annoying when we are gaming or being on Social medias). Please fix this.",positive

Worst music and podcast app available Edit: 6/30/2022 (over a year later) This app accrossed all my devices is still absolutely horrible.

"Used to love this app.. the 30 minutes without interruption. good times. now it's an ad every 1-2 songs. I barely use this app anymore because of it. and when it says ""30 minutes without interruption"" it's actually just 4 songs then like 10 ads straight.",neutral
I love to sing so I love this decause there are not a lot of adds and you can listen to music and not be interpreted and listen to any song the song you love.,positive
had only no song only hard,negative
"It's a good app for listening music but it's too restricting, when i play my fav song it automatically played another song which is not in my playlist.",negative
"It is really awesome ❤. Like so much better than the YouTube app. When I close yt, the song or video doesn't continue playing. It's because I am a tablet user. But Spotify is really awesome. If I close it the song still plays. It even asks you for your three fav artists and it makes you a mix by yr personality. Great music platform! Tap install already now! ❤😃",positive
Actually the pc version is good you can atleast select between the songs in your playlist and in this app you can't even do that and when i play my playlist it automatically selects shuffle and sometimes it just playes a songs that is not even in my playlist a rubbish app deleting it.,negative
"Good app, but lots of Add",positive
Music is great even has some classics but it only lets you skip song 6 tims instead of as many times as you want and it dose not let you just listen to you're play list with out the suggested songs unless you have premium and it sucks.,neutral
"Hello! I'm new to Spotify and this is my first time using it. I'm loving it so far! I just have a few suggestions, 1. In the music player, we should be able to swipe down and up without having to use the arrow. 2. A double tap to seek for about 10 seconds would be really nice to add. 3. In the mini music player, we should be able to swipe down to get rid of it. 4. More animations when you click the pause and play button would make Spotify better. And 5. Sometimes the app will crash after opening",positive
I cant even play the song i want it just shuffle to another song😡,negative
It is an excellent music app,positive
"I used to enjoy the app a lot more even though it's been glitchy and laggy from time to time but now I have to deal with advertisements every two songs, 3 if I'm lucky. And not just 1 or 2 ads but 3-4 ads and the same ones over and over again. So for every half an hour I listen I hear like 10+ ads and it gets old fast. When I skip a song or change channels it goes straight to ads again, so I feel stuck listening to something I don't want to so as to avoid the same ads yet again.",negative
Worst app ever used. It has more adds than songs that we search for. Irritating adds force me to uninstall.,negative
Great app but very annoying. I accidentally hit 'do not play again' because I wanted it to play on loop and now I cant play it no more and it really anoys me because this is the only app I can shut my phone off with,negative
"Simply select the mood and you will be taken by it, so simple",positive
"The app is really good, but I hate how how you have to shuffle to listen to playlist and not just pick a song you want to listen to, and how many ads there are. I get 9-10 ads before I can listen to a song. Or the song just gets skipped cause of “Internet connections” even though I'm connected to strong internet. Some times I hate how you need to pay for a offline playlist. Spotify is a really good app, but even though it has some pros, it has a lot more down sides to it.",negative
Nice application for song lover.,positive
Sometimes there's an annoying bug… It closed by itself or just stop playing,positive
Great variety of music,positive
Great human story - great interview where the interviewer draws an amazing story from Jay Gaffey - looking forward to Pt 2,positive

Thanks for making ads unskippable out of nowhere so you f me up while traveling on the road. I will never buy anything I hear from a Spotify ad because I can't skip.,negative
Finally got Spotify Premium and it's worth it. No more annoying ads and so many features. The price is reasonable to be fair. I just love it.,positive
"Never had an app that literally ignores my imput... garbage. I search a song I want to listen to, listen to the ad then guess what... It plays sum bs not even related to the artist or song I want to hear. Okay no big deal I'll just skip it then... NOPE ANOTHER IRRELEVANT song I didn't ask for until I have no skips left and it never attempted to play the song or artist I wanted. Again... garbage",negative
One suggestion: Add shuffle and repeat buttons to the mini player in lock screen,positive

"So every week on my release radar, spotify keeps putting a random artist from a genre that i never listen to, but the song has one of bands i listen a lot tagged as a associated artist even though they aren't. For example the song: ""UTOPIA-Abridged"" by Harper Minta, Aer, Blu, and the odd ball Avatar. Which is a swedish heavy-death metal band...",positive
Too many commercials after first 30 minutes.,neutral
I think that the app is great it works well and has atleast 99% of the songs I like saying I'm a k-pop fan but it glitches pretty often I don't know if it happens to other people too but it happens for me quite often please fix this.,positive

Just one suggestion: I've created my own Playlist and everything is fine but when I've shared it with my friends they aren't getting shuffle option for the playlist. Same problem I've experienced with many other Playlists. Please provide the shuffle option for all Playlists and if it's a bug then resolve it.,positive
"Autoolay problem. I've disabled the setting, but spotify still plays songs that are suggested instead of the actual songs that are in my Playlist. I have premium though, it's just straight up dogshit. Use youtube instead.",negative

"Music is my life, and i honestly don't know where I'd be without it. I've downloaded so many apps to stream music but none of those apps come anywhere close to being as good as Spotify. Not only does it have any and every artist album and song you could think of but Spotify is always looking to find ways to keep the consumers happy and satisfied.",positive
It's ok but I wish there was an option for them to recommend music in you playlist I wish you could turn it on or off,negative
The best music app ever,positive

I found all my related songs at one place. Recommended.,positive
"Love Spotify it is worth every penny. I like that I can take my music everywhere I got with no enteruptions. You can find all kinds of stuff in the app to, not just music.",positive
I'm getting fed up with Spotify. Even though I have almost 2000 liked songs it plays the same hundred or so when on shuffle. To the point where I end up unliking some of my favorite songs so they don't get over played. I want a shuffle option where songs are not repeated until all songs have been played. And it should be able to keep track of what's been played over multiple days. Also wish the algorithm could recognize a genre I play infrequently and not change my recommendations.,negative
It has a lot of choices but it will pause my song mid way through or restart it.,positive
Very large selection of music I like being able to select albums,positive
"Updating Spotify is risky. With the last few iterations, podcast downloads take forever because they keep restarting from 0%",neutral
It was a good experience having spotify. It gives a lot of energy and hype when I have it and it makes me more love music because somehow it is my comfort care for myself. All in all its very good.,positive
I love this app except for the fact that there are constant ads. I know that's just a way for the developers to get people to buy premium but it's just infuriating.,negative
"Every song is available, & best interface among others.",positive
"I have been using the app since 5 years now, and frankly, it is a good app. But these days there are many problems with the app. Though I have purchased the premium package, I am not able to listen to the songs I want, or search for any song. It says something went wrong, or no internet connection. I waited for more than a year for the issue to get fixed. If this continues, I dont think I will renew my premium package anymore. There is no point since I cant listen to any songs.",negative
Only plays shuffle. Spotify sux,negative
Good buffet of songs.,positive
The app has been working for me sense 2019 and its pretty good but unfortunately when i go to daily mix it shuffles the playlists with songs that arent in that mix and yes i refreshed and swiped off the app and reopening it but it still stayed on shuffle mode even if i reinstalled it its still on shuffle so i don't know if its an update or a unfixable glitch,positive
too bad cant play songs bad update,negative

Stuck at shuffle .. no button to undo it ..,negative
"Editing playlists, making playlists, and even playing songs are a chore using this app. The ui can use alot of work, and the fact that so many necessary features are locked behind premium make it so much more aggravating.

Very bad I got continuously 4 ads ...😢 Around 1 min there must be some limit on ads you can't show it however you want I only listen music on Spotify. But this disappoints me.😢😢,negative

My problem is that i chose a song and it sends me to another song I don't want and i am pretty sure that is for premium but seriosly premium to stop shuffling,neutral
I wish that you could choose whether or not you want spotify to add to your playlists... I personally hate it... I made the playlist with certain songs in it... I don't need more songs added... maybe you could recommend those songs to be added but you just adding them makes my playlists useless and there was no point in me making it if you were just going to change it,negative
Love using Spotify it's just I hateeeee the ads but I don't wanna have to pay just to get rid of them other than that I love everything about it.,positive

A idea for Spotify: Imagine being able to choose the years of your favorite singers activities and just listen to the period of songs produced in those years. I hope can see this option soon in the Spotify,positive

"Didnt care for Spotify at 1st.. BUT ONCE I learned how it worked I FREAKING LOVED IT!! I love how it somewhat ""Learns"" the user & makes Playlist for the user on a day to day basis. It also keeps you up to date with other songs new & old! DEFINITELY WORTH DOWNLOADING! I also like how you can use Spotify & also do other things on your device without it ever Interrupting your JAMZ! Oh yeah, also if you have Premium, you can download music and use even when you have ""No Service* #UseItDaily",positive
Excellent app! You can make your own playlist of your favorite singer!,positive
Why is it that the volume always get turned down automatically when it's on 100%. There aren't any settings to change this either. I'm canceling my premium if this doesn't get fixed,negative

This is the best the only problem I had with it it is when I like I want to listen to a song like what I'm doing the dishes or something you don't need to know sometimes it would disconnect from my headset but other than that it's fine I love it,positive
Love that they have any music that you want to here. I couldn't do without my play list,positive
"At first this app was the best but now because of the new update that we can't listen to our specify favourite song and play randomly. Same thing happens in playlist,there is no song name but only text about the writer and song name. This update i didn't like and so I am giving it 3 stars for that.",neutral
Premium too expensive.,neutral
Unusable without premium. Feels like a version of Itunes from 2004 with how primitive it is without premium. Don't waste your time.,negative
Love this app. I love controlling my TV. It's just frustrating sometimes to edit Playlist from the phone.,positive
I'm using the app on a new device and I'm using it online with a strong consistent wifi connection but it refuses to play the full songs in my Playlists. The playlists look just as if they would offline because I don't have the premium. It didn't do this before on my other devices and it's seriously annoying. It also has the same bugs everyone else is complaining about on my other devices. What I experienced is the app pausing my music randomly. I've re-installed this app 3 times now.,negative

The music is phenomenal!!!,positive
Not sure what is going on but automatic opening is aggravating...THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP... ANNOYED‼️,neutral
This app is easy to use the problem is with the interface. AI should be capable of picking a larger variety of songs instead of the top 100 in each playlist. If you make your own playlist it's great but if you listen to the daily mixes it's almost all the same songs in a different order in each list.,neutral

I never expected to find greatest music 🎶! Thank,positive
"Love love love. My favorite app for music. I have a recommendation or two. It would be super cool if you could create easier ways to organize music to playlists. Like creating four boxes that you can personalize. One for podcasts, for artists, for songs, etc. Something where you could add playlists in. It would also be awesome if there was a + you could click on when you want to add a song to a playlist(or playlists) while on the lock screen. Thankss",positive
So far so good. I've never had a problem or complaint with this app.,positive
Almost each and every song I can think of is here.,positive

I had a very good experience until now but Spotify robbed my money when I paid for the premium subscription and I didn't get the premium account activated after the successful payment and I still haven't received my refund back all they say is that they didn't receive the payment which was successfully from my side. Don't subscribe for premium with UPI they will rob you.,negative
Great app especially for podcasts. Only reason I'm not giving five stars is because it can be very very slow sometimes.,positive
"I hope this app fixes itself because I am really not happy with the results. In the free plan, you get SIX skips an hour. Which means you have to sit through songs you hate or dont want to here at the time. You cant pick a song and play it, which is really bad for picking a song you want to watch. And one of the most annoying things is that it will ADD RANDOM SONGS TO YOUR PLAYLISTS. THIS DOES NOT WORK. HOW BSREBONES CAN YOU EVEN KEEP A FREE VERSION. Never spend a penny on this app. Use audity.",negative
If I'm paying for Ad free it should apply to podcasts too.,negative
Great app clear and crisp sound 👌,positive
Please allow premium subscription to be paid by Google Play Store balance as it is in other apps.,positive
"App was fine until I purchased premium membership. Free version shoes ads after every 30 minutes which is okay but when I purchased Premium subscription for a day to try premium, ads popped up after every 2 songs which was like 5-7 minutes. At first I thought it'd be a glitch but even after relaunching the app same thing happened which spoiled party ridiculously. I am glad I din't purchase monthly or yearly package. Whoever thinking to buy premium membership, DON'T GO FOR IT AT ALL. TRY GAANA.",negative
I love Spotify I can find old country music that I grew up listening to. My parents were musicians. I'm a die hard old country music fan. Don't like the new stuff. I'm 80 yrs old.

*edit: so many features are broken and don't work. Getting worse Great except the podcast player is not as good as others (deleting downloads already listened to/sorting) Recently offline mode is horrible to use. Songs and I have downloaded won't play/are greyed out and say internet is not available. If I reconnect to wifi all my downloads become available next time I disconnect. A day without internet will cut my downloads out. Very frustrating when cellular data or internet is not easy to get.,negative

My premium doesnt work and i tried everything already but it wont work.,negative
Disappearing controls are making this app unusable. It also ignores my setting to not resume playing automatically (I NEVER WANT THIS-- WHO DOES?!) I've been waiting for over a year for these to be fixed and nothing. Another android dev team failing to bother testing their own app!,negative

"There are a number of features I like, they include: 1) Replaying a song you like without having to listen to ads. 2) Synchronized highlighting of lyrics. 3) Including lessor known singers while listening to a genre like ""Classic Rock"". 4) I love the fact Spotify works outside the US unlike some other streaming services. 5) When you select an specific group the suggested groups you might like are very nicely curated!",positive
The only reason why I give it 4 and not 5 is because it adds to many songs to my playlist and it doesn't give me enough skips to skip them so I get stuck listening to songs that I don't like and that I never even heard,positive
Love this app I play music almost every minute of the day,positive
Wow! nice but I can't download any music,positive
"App has suddenly become horribly unstable. Frequently, a new song will start, but the notification won't update. When this happens, the app will only open as a black screen and the only way to stop music is to force stop the app. Have tried all the usual troubleshooting, cleared data, reinstalled, etc. but this still happens almost every time i listen to music with the app.",positive
The best app ever I would totally recommend it to a lot of people love you Spotify,positive
"I'm not sure if it's just my app but it's beyond a joke now. My friends say they get 1 or 2 ads in between songs when I get 4+, I've even had 7 ads in a row!! Please fix this, it's incredibly annoying and I don't have the money for premium",neutral
Been trying tp get the premium pack but neither the system let me do it.1,neutral
The app has all the original version of the songs,positive
Great app with a very good sound quality. Works great with my voice assistant too which is a bonus,positive
"I hear my friends talking about spotify , how good it is this app to listen any kind of music , I'm a Salsa music fan and you didn't hear this music in the radio station anymore .so I download this app and I'm so happy to play anytime the Salsa music that I love to hear !!!",positive
Love spotify. Only change I'd have is to be able to reorder my playlists easily. I've added whole albums to my playlist before but don't want them to be all in a row. If there was a way to permanently shuffle the list that would be awesome!!,positive
"Spotify is nice and all but when ever I try to play a song I want to play it plays another song that is similar to the one I want to hear, I never get to listen to the actual songs I want to listen to and it's kind of annoying",negative
Pretty easy to use and organized UI/UX,positive
Only problem i've encountered that actually bothers me is the cut down lyrics. A lot of songs have missing words and that kinda sucks.,positive
showing break after a every song because u want that users take your premium account by getting frustrated of seeing ads. Worst app!! They interupt after every song by showing ads and say after every ad enjoy the next 30 minutes without interuption 🤯,negative
There are numerous stability issues with the app in June 2022.,negative
This is the worst app that I have ever used. I can hear ads after playing 2 to 3 songs even though we don't want to buy the premium the ads are increasing day by day and I am sure that this strategy will lose a lot of customers and I am sure that you have got 4.3 ratings and it is going to turn into 3 very soon,negative
It's so good These are all song which you want,positive
Controls keep disappearing so I can't stop music or podcasts without forcing the app to stop. Happens again I'll switch.,negative
Vvvv poor. Soo much ads. Didn't liked much. Mood spoiler 👎👎,negative
"one word, Fantastic.",positive
It's a really good music app u til your free trial is over and nothing works until you buy something,positive
If you are a free user you can't skip a song after 6 songs??? I get it for the other features but skipping a song? Nop,negative
Great app for listening music 🎶.,positive
One of the Splendid Musical Apps as I luv to read the lyrics along with the song.,positive
I love ❤️ Spotify music and the GREATEST OF Jo ROGAN PODCASTER,positive
The last month this app has progressively gotten worse. After the last attempt to uninstall/reinstall all of my playlists are empty and I get a message saying there isnt internet connection and to try again. So frustrating since I'm paying for the premium.,negative
It doesn't allow me to log in it says im abroad and shouldn't change my location even after i do so it doesn't allow me in i will change jt when when it start working,negative
"Controls to pause, skip track, etc have disappeared for days. Killing the app was a fix but that has stopped working.",neutral
"lately I've been having A LOT of problems with spotify. the songs just won't play normally, it pauses every 10 seconds without explanation. and it's been happening on the desktop version too. please fix it, it's really annoying.",negative
My everyday music app. Has a large database of songs compared to Prime Music.,positive
Ads and limited skips??? Come on Spotify. You are going to lose customers now. The reason I left Pandora was the ads and skip limits!! NOT HAPPY!!,negative
"Love the app , although they shud let rhe ppl online have a lil more accessible option",positive
I love how I can turn off the screen and still listen. My only complaint is how it will play the next newer podcast file rather than go down the list.. it would be nice if there was an option to autoplay in either direction on the list,positive
Not work in my mobile properly just useless,negative
Why so many ads in every 2 songs. They say one ads for 30 min whts going on this app Too many ads worst app,negative
Why can't you choose your own songs? It'll make it simpler and give people more freedom.,negative
"Loved Spotify premium when I had it, but as soon as I couldn't afford it I was booted to free Spotify, and I never realized how absolutely awful it is. Limited skips and the inability to pick a song or make a queue is maddening. As someone with ADHD, I need this ability because I often need specific songs for certain activities. But no, that is now impossible because I am poor. Thanks for making me feel worse about it, Spotify.",negative
Spotify just gives a wonderful experience to music,positive
I love the app. I do wish there was a way to remove songs from the recommended section at the bottom of the playlist that way you could get new recommendations without having to hit refresh a bunch of times.,positive
It's alright best to get a subscription to enjoy all features. It's still good when free too.,positive
I just love having access to all types of songs that speak to my current situations. Love being able to download and listen even when I'm away from home. My alarm is linked to Spotify and my mornings start with the best melodies,positive
"This app is actually very useful for , like the songs that I don't have , they have it here and I can play one of my favourite songs even though I don't have the song. But the problem is that I don't always have data . For once can't there be a good app that doesn't have to use up data or WI-FI. Like really we don't ( I don't ) have the money to buy data every time I need to come on Spotify . Thank you .",neutral
I am not able to open Spotify it just freezes when I try to open it on the main screen I can't listen to songs 😭 HELP!!!,negative

Great app easy to listen and share music,positive
I'm using first time this music app it's amazing music collection. Thanks for the making app,positive
"I've been using this app for years and only recently decided to upgrade to premium. I was very excited with all the perks you get. The only downside to it however, is that for some reason I'm still getting adds whenever I listen to podcasts? Which I don't really understand? Because, you know, I'm PAYING for NO ads? I mean I can understand when you get adds from the person you're listening to cuz they're built into the audio. But I've heard the SAME adds in multiple podcasts. Kinda dumb right?😑",neutral
"I hate everything about this app, the most user-friendly app I have ever purchased. Day one and I can not cancel it fast enough.",negative
Love it! Easy and everything I love,positive
Exceptional application and exquisite terms of use.,positive
"Great app, it's my go to for music.",positive

"Google Home speaker volumes never stay at what I set them to when playing via Spotify. Set the volume from Spotify and it resets one speaker (but not the other) back down to ~25%, when I didn't ask it to do that, even if I was turning the volume UP it still resets it down. It's really annoying and it needs to be fixed.",negative
"All good...try making some daily mix according to various moods intead of same playlists ....and adds making experience annoying at some moments..except for this, all else is fine !!!",positive
On playstation ads freeze up the app and it has to be restarted once a week of not more. On my phone I have to force close the app or else it will stay open in the background.,negative

i like using spotify because i find all my favorite songs in it and other things that may please everyone but the only problem is that it needs wifi and you can't skip just 5 times per hour ..but i still like it,positive
This app was good before not now cus this is not performing well with my phone it crashes frequently and shows ' no internet connection ' even though it is connected. It's kinda disappointed with Spotify,negative
Absolutely 💯 % fantastic for music of any genre looking forward to the moment I move to premium.,positive
Group session is not working even when I'm on premium,negative
This is the best app for songs I ever had 👍,positive

This is a great app to use for listening to music for free! The only problem is sometimes I'll get like 5 ads in a row. But otherwise 10/10 recommend!,positive
"spotify on chromebook is awful, i genuinely dont understand why it is so bad. the app shuts down almost every hour, the music is laggy and you cannot see friends activity. i really hope they improve the app because it honestly ruins my music listening experience while i work on my chromebook",negative
Very good music but premium is a bit pricey,positive
I have downloaded the Spotify app on my Android phone and it gets stuck at the Spotify logo. I've restarted my phone a few times. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I've forced stop the app and restart it again. I'm connected to the internet. Nothing works. It remained stuck at the Spotify logo.,negative
This app sucks. It is the worst. I have tried managing it but it just isn't worth it. Don't install the app especially if you have a Samsung. It doesn't allow you to fast forward the music. It also doesn't let you to go back to a previous song or go to the next song for free. I hate this god damn app😡😡🔥😡🔥😡🔥😡🔥😡😡. It f ing sucks 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡.,negative
"You know, ive had this app for a couple years now. I even PAID FOR PREMIUM. IT DOES NO GOOD. ON -ROKU- THEY STILL HAVE NOT FIXED THEIR APP TO PLAY MORE THAN 10 MINUTES WITHOUT FREEZING!!! YOU HAVE ONLY 1 JOB, PEOPLE. LITTLE CHANNELS PRODUCED IN GRANDMAS BASEMENT CAN RUN SEEMLESSLY ON -ROKU- WHY CANT YOU?",negative
My type of songs. Love them. Thank you🌺,positive
Best music player ....... You can create your own playlist ans share with your friend's and realtives ....... Just one problem it contains add when you don't have premium subscription ..... I have premium subscription so i dont face problem,positive
Just love all the great music choices!!!,positive
Changed my previous back to 5 stars. The ability to preview songs before adding them to your playlist is back. Back to being my favorite music app :),positive
I like it but I have one problem that is the extra songs I hate it when my favorite songs end one of the extra songs starts to play plz delete it,positive
"Filled with ads, they basically make u desperate to buy premium, and even after they give an ad which gives us 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening, one song later, there is a new ad!!",neutral
It is a very good app. It has all the music you need. So you should all try it,positive
"bring back the ability to play and shuffle at the same time or i'm canceling my premium. this is ridiculous, who asked for that to go away?",negative
Found everything i wanted in this app I'm going premium very affordable,positive
Don’t download this app this app is trying is best to make it hard to listen songs. Hate suffle 🤬 Just try mod apk its great or buy premium don’t be a fool😘,negative
"Player doesn't remember the time i left off at while listening to podcasts, seems like every update breaks a major component of this app...",negative
Spotify is better than other apps its doesn't stuck Which is pretty good but one thing you can bring is some more songs maybe cuz i didn't find much Chinese popular songs not only Chinese you may add some others too that is my suggestions,positive
"The app sucks. I pay for dual membership and it constantly stops on its own for no reason, not connected to anything. The play bar disappears and the only way to pause it is to close the app entirely. It constantly rewinds itself 10 seconds when playing podcasts. And it's not just my phone it's my husband's too. Both are fairly new phones. It's ridiculous to pay for a service as much as we do and they can't even get the app to work properly. And I do have auto updates turned on.",negative
2 stars due to lagging play a song allgood 2nd song comes on plays for about 20sec then cuts off everytime. Iv uninstalled and reinstalled to see if it fix the problem and nothing still the same and I'm a premium customer this use to be one of the best apps.. what's going on Spotify paid customer to get ripped off not cool. If not fixed uninstalling for good take my $$ somewhere else.,negative
I'd rather use YouTube/ YouTube music. At least it gives you enough features while having the ads. Spotify doesn't even play some songs if you don't have a subscription,negative
Can't think of a better music app but only thing is I've been having trouble with bugs for a few days now.. so requesting u to fix those bugs and the rest is fine Ps- I'll change my review once the bugs r fixed,neutral
"They blatantly lie about the free version, making me distrust them so much I won't uograde to premium. They claim that fewer than 15 tracks on a playlist in free mode means they'll add songs to the playlist. I have >20 & they keep adding tracks, including tracks I already hid. Plus, they are STILL one of the worst in paying artists, so I'll continue to pay Apple Music despite its glitches (pays almost double). App's also not intuitive, and I won't pay extra for something misleading and greedy.",negative
"Best music streaming app I have used. **After a few years, I still agree. I used Pandora, and have access to it free w/ TMobile, have used IHeart and others. My experience w/ Spotify does not falter.",positive
It is amazing and so much fun to listen the song back to back with spotify I loved this app,positive

Always interrupts ads,negative
"Developer's, You collect to much of my personal info, then it states I can delete all of my personal info. I can't delete mine! I just turned phone on. Spotify was playing a show when I didn't turn Spotify on. I uninstalled the application. I want my personal information Deleted! Please fix this. I don't know what Android wear is, but that's the 1st question.",negative
Apart from having to pay £10 because that all I can afford to get ad free music is PERFECT! Thx,positive
"Fix Android Auto integration. Performance is poor and interface is terrible. Menus are very poorly thought-out, recently played is never up to date and playlists are difficult to search.",negative
The last update of Spotify is totally sucks. I can't played all my favorites music anymore if im offline and all my downloaded playlist is totally gone. What happened Spotify fixed all the bug and changes and all the mess you done. And its restricted the plan even you pay premium. Please back the old update. I loved the application but this is very disappointed and frustrating. Im using Spotify from the start and paying premium every monthly.,negative
It's really good app because in the traveling we can listen many playlist...,positive
"Premium is Best , plain is full of Add",positive
To many advertisement!!!,negative
I've used it for years. Even without premium there aren't many ads so it's ok to listen without it.,positive
Always have music on so use Spotify and stream it through house.,positive
Love no ads!,positive
"The app will NOT work. Just a black screen with spotify icon. Have cleared cache and data, logged out, reinstalled, restarted device. No purported solutions work!! So frustrating. Support is garbage as well. Chat support has you do the abovementioned over and over with same results...Einstein's definition. Premium is a cimolete ripoff if it won't work on mobile devices!!!!",negative
"Free listeners get about a minute and a half of ads every two songs. It's crazy excessive. And you're forced to listen to you're playlist on shuffle. You can't pick what song you want to listen to, or listen to your playlist straight through. I know they want you to buy Spotify Premium, but ruining the free experience is not the way to do it",negative
I like it but pls allow a ewallet pay section for premium pls i really need it,neutral
"If you want to be a free listener, then don't get it. You have limited skips and you can't pick the songs you want. I would recommend Pandora.",negative
I dont know why the app is stuck right now. It does not open. Its for the first time since i am using. I have reinstalled it twice but nothing changed. It was ok before but idk what has happened. Plz guide me!!,neutral
User interface isn't customizable and Spotify doesn't care what their users want. Another company that doesn't respect their paid users.,negative
"Its Great app, No complaint so far.",positive
6/29 Update - STILL Constantly deletes downloaded songs. All the time it just deletes the entire library.,negative
"I downloaded this app, started using it,it was fun but after few days, songs I liked ain't playing anymore.",neutral

It doesn't run in the background consistently when the phone is locked (even though it has the permission) also sometimes it takes too long for it to load the song, even on high speed internet.

"Great algorithm, loving the app.",positive
"Easy to use, sound is okay. They took away, for free users, the ability to pick a song from an album and add it to a Playlist. They wouldn't let you listen to it, which is fair, but atleast you could add it to a Playlist and enjoy later. Now all you can do is shuffle a artist and hope you get the song you want.",negative
So easy to use and it is awsome app.,positive
Awesome...has tons of song options and almost always has the songs I'm looking for!! Highly recommend this app to everyone.,positive
If I could give zero I would worst music app ever,negative

Only 4 stars because there will always be room for improvement.,positive
Besides the free music. It has terrible navigation. I cant play a specific song from a playlist. Either that or the features are well hidden,neutral

Good but wish it was better the fact that u can't pick the exact song u want to play but u have to wait and the ads are a problem if ur not paying for the premium.,neutral
I listen to it every day. Lots of options for us podcast junkies,positive
"I hate the recent changes to the ""My Library"" section of the app. Bad design choice. Please revert back. -6/7/2021 That was my last review. Now I'm going back and reducing my rating even further because the quality of service from Spotify and their application has gotten worse. I pay for Spotify premium to have an ad free listening experience. Spotify is now inserting ads into podcasts that already have integrated sponsorships, even for premium users. 1 star.",negative
Love Spotify. I especially like how Spotify exposes me to music that I would normally never hear on commercial radio. Totally recommend,positive
This device is too slow and too demanding. There's s lot of features that complicate it's use. Spotify does not work at all.,negative
Amazing! Almost every day at every hour I listen to music and Spotify gives me a lot of opportunities to keep listening my favorite jams and podcast.,positive

I stopped listening to the music, but then the ads started to come into the podcasts. For the last 3 years had this not happened. Please change it back.",positive
If I say play my liked songs don't play songs that I didn't like I liked them for a reason so I can listen to it,negative

"Never take their offer. They wont stop charging you! Its because anyone on your network can click on premium and your paying. No way to stop this, have to delete Spotify and never use it again. Only option. You will have to cancel your bank card. They will ask for pictures of your bank account to prove it. Dont trust these criminals at all with your bank info.",negative
Best music quality of all music apps.Even all new and old songs are present on Spotify. And provides you playlists of your own choice.,positive
Spotify was great ... but now..it's not the same. I cannot get karaoke mode in my samsung tab and for many songs lyrics are not there,negative
"Spotify is a great app, started using it this year and it has really met my expectations. The premium feature is good and saves one from those ads popping up. The real issue I have is that can you create a mode where one can resume his playlist after playing a particular music or album, coming to start your playlist afresh after listening to an album can be sad. I once resume my playlist during the free listen mode but I can't anymore using the premium feature.",positive
Love it so much haven't experienced any problems so far. It's good to listen to podcasts while jogging or busy with work that doesn't need my full attention.,positive
Great selection of music and podcasts,positive
Too many ads and can't pick a song always dhaffles.,negative
"Bad functionality , sometimes it's nt working proper.",negative
"Love the music, love the layout, love eveything about it, only issues I've had were at times not being able to see the year recap, not that important but it's a great feature at the end of the year or decade and lots of people put effort into others and users seeing it, and some look forward to seeing their music efforts or changes or feelings, so it kinda sucks that it can but out for you If you are on a lower end phone or a phone with poor storage, mine has both issues, but otherwise, love it",positive
"Great app overall but Group Session really needs to be fixed. For the past months, the song plays out loud on all connected devices, connected devices can't access other apps that make sounds without cutting the music and the queue often glitches, and replays the same songs.",neutral
Why the hell this crashes everytime,negative
Nice app for listening songs,positive
Very nice app I get all the songs without give money and with very less ad,positive
I love that you can multiple playlist it's really wonderful to be able to play the music that you like and the different playlist and even ones with albums to play whenever you want them to or to play continuously it's there are no ads eit I've never loved music more I can pick all the ones that I want and put them in one John and I can pick all the other ones that I really like and put them in another one and then I have at least two that I can listen to but I have five right now and it's great,positive

No problem in using this app got better experience here a large collection of song or we can say that universal collection...,positive
"Some UI hiccups quite often (freezes, UI inresponsive etc.). Also, keeps asking Bluetooh permission all the time, this is super annoying! If I say no (actually not an option, only ""Maybe later""), the app should not keep pushing for an access. I find it little shady that app wants to constantly spy the BT devices near me.",negative
Poor optimization and network issue,negative

6skips per hour +they will force you to listen in other song that you don't even want so you are most likely to skip it that's where the annoying part is gonna start... 6skips won't be enough to play the song you want like I mean literally.,negative
Absolutely love Spotify.,positive
"It has a lot of music but there are a lot of small issues. Deluxe versions of albums that I bought on iTunes however long ago aren't available and there's no way for me to add music that I already paid for. The shuffle algorithm is straight up horrible. Also, it'll randomly switch from my liked songs to a song's ""radio"", e.g. a discovery mode. And I don't want that and I'm not sure how or why it happens",neutral
Full of ads .. they offer 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening and then ad came after every song,negative

Great music at my fingertips. Love it,positive
"Buggy mess on samsung fold. Whoever fault it is, the OS does not pick up spotifys audio stream as media, so once you start playing a song it cannot be stopped or interacted with without quitting the app. Audio continues to pay in background on other apps such as YouTube",negative
Love Spotify new to it enjoying it,positive
"Its a good app I like it, but it's so damn annoying bec of the ads. Like i just accidentally clicked some song then literally 3 ads appear & it's unskippable. I'm on mobile. On pc this app works great, so please just let the ads come after a while they keep on popping up.",positive
"The app is good but that not the reason why I gave it three stars for the pass month of two my music keeps cutting half way or it will cut from the beginning of the song i can't even go on my other social media apps without Spotify acting up its extremely hard for me to listen to my music. Spotify if the only song / podcast place that I use when my hands are busy, the adverts are just the worse also 6 skip each hour isn't good at all.",neutral
"It's so good to listen to good music on a user friendly platform,but still room for improvement, Spotify is oviously the best out there. HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOWNLOAD",positive
"Started off well, could listen to songs and skip songs if I wasn't wanting to listen to that one that day. Then suddenly cannot skip songs. By all means have adverts but allow songs to be skipped. Songs have emotional connections and some days you're not ready for certain songs. I think I will have to delete",negative
App stopped working after update. I can only play saved music because the main page or search doesn't appear at all.,negative
Superb app. Specially for searching songs,positive

This app is good but it should be run offline as well,positive
"It's a really good app , you can listen audios, songs, etc while being on another app at the same time. I had no problem signing in in this device, but then I signed in from another device. I inserted the name, password,email etc and all, but it kept loading forever. The app kept on loading the next day and on and on, it never let me in. It's an annoying glitch and it makes me really disappointed and mad. Fix this glitch soon as possible.",positive

Great app! But I really do wish Spotify would include loseless audio for a much better music quality.,positive
"I use to love this app. To me, it use to be one of the best music apps. But after last update, it has gone down hill. Now when I listen to a playlist it will just start playing random music and then start the playlist over again. I use to never have any problems. Now it is full of bugs. Until it gets fixed, I won't be using it anymore. Until it is fixed, I wouldn't recommend it to others either.",negative
Why i cant update my app you have a new karaoke mode but my app is still not updated.,negative
I am able to play music but some of the time the music is going to a different song instead of my actual list and I haven't even finished the playlist yet!!! Fix it.,neutral

No prob with music.excellent,positive
Please add the add to queue option from search Bar too,positive
"App bugs, shows ""No internet available"" , even i have High speed connection available.",negative
"You can stream songs in a lot of places this might be the worst, if you want to make a play list they add songs to YOUR play list and give you only 6 skips an hour so you don't get to listen to your own songs on YOUR play list you don't have enough skips to get to your songs and if you delete them of the play list they add more it is very anoing if you just want to play some music.",negative

It's good but when I playy fav song it play other song that I don't like and it makes me mad because I tried it hundred times but still it play other song,negative
Best app for listening music ...,positive
It's good because it is nationwide music app for listening but I hate that I can't become a premium membership because I am in highschool and I don't have money or ATM to pay in Spotify so that is the problem and of course the ads because I am not in premium and when you want to change the music it can't cause it has a limited time only at 30min or you can't change cause only 3 song's only so that's my feedback.HAVE. A GOOD 😊 DAY,neutral
"Overall it's an amazing music app. However, i have recently been unable to see some of the buttons and icons when operating the app. It definitely looks weird and incomplete. It would also be nice if non-premium users would get a chance to join in on the group sessions. I'd have given a 5⭐ but I'll do a 2⭐ until the issue is resolved.",negative
Your App is addictive. It has a unique way of compiling music of same genre by different artist in one place. Great indeed.,neutral
To many adds . After a song you get a add this goes on and on.,negative
Very good music excellent to listen to . A fantastic variety of music to choose from,positive
"The app wont load. Uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted phone, freezes at logo screen. I pay for this and cant access ANY of my music. That unsubscribe button is looking very tempting..",negative
I rate it to stars because it's just it's just so boring it won't let me play on music something was very bad about this can anyone fix this please fix the Spotify,negative

"I love the downloads, although sometimes I would like for them to download a little faster, and if they had that singalong lyrics 2 that would be great",positive
It's great now I can use this app at my country cause previously you couldn't connect to it,positive
I'm Very disappointed in this app it keeps playing the other songs that I didn't add in my playlist I skipped many songs but the random songs keep playing in my playlist.,negative
"I personally love Spotify, it has got amazing songs and podcasts too but my complaint has got to be about the length of the adverts and just the adverts in general, I can agree with giving 2 ads every now and then but when it's the same repetitive long ad coming on 3 times that's when I get annoyed and it is fair enough to put ads in if not paying for premium but I just feel they are too long. Other then that I love this app!",positive
Would definitely recommend Spotify to a friend.,positive
10/10 its just a tad bit difficult skipping songs on iphone.,positive
Love this music app!,positive
Best online music platform ever.,positive
"App is a mess, playback wont continue anymore. Sick to death of this ""premium"" service that constantly cuts in and out. Sick of posting help post in community. Going back to pirating.",negative
"False advertisement Well ihave been using jio savan but iam sick of adds in the middle of songs uninstalled the app. Then coincidentally i saw soo many adds related to spotify telling its add free, for this reason iam sold. After installing 1st day is normal no adds, started in the nxt day. So many adds foe every single sond there is add, if you really showing adds then dont advertise as add free.",negative
The best music app indeed.,positive
Why don't your l have the premium mini And why did you're make this app can't listen to a music with out paying,negative
The sound turns off even though it shows the song is being played.,negative
"hires audio online app, enjoy every music clear crisp",positive
I really like it but I wish we could select the songs of our choice and skip the 1 we don like without premium,neutral
It provides everything I need to listen to music from the past and present.,positive
"Amazing app, if you fix that it doesn't add more than one songs to queue and randomly skips queues when opened and played straight from the bar below...And please bring lossless music asap.",positive
We can hear songs in between adds Prepared for adds play list Every song adds,negative
Such a good app I mean what's wrong about it you have a repeat playlist so you can listen to your favorite songs but one thing add more skips plz Spotify well by adding more skips still a five stars 🤩,positive
I had to switch accounts due to a mistake. Now after I logged out the app won't even load! I've done everything possible 5 times over & nothing will get the app to load.,negative
The new update is incredibly nice and sound quality is good! Spotify Premium is truly worth it. I absolutely recommend Spotify more than other music streaming services. Thank you Spotify! 😊,positive
Doesn't have streaming issues n it quite entertaining and you gotta get it if u don't already have it,positive
i dunno why the lyrics cant appear even it's premium.. help me,positive
bro I be spending hours listening to music on this app i love it. it works fine most of the time (the ads are annoying but I understand that there need to be ads for the app to be free) but I really like making playlists and stuff.,positive
I want shuffle button for free user or make this app non free user anymore,negative
I love being able to feel emotions by music. Spotify is amazing.,positive
"Its a great app but I genuinely hate the fact they took away to preview songs, And the ads have been getting massively out of hand. I get like 5-6 in between 2 songs.",neutral
"I really enjoy Spotify. It's only real drawback are the ads. I understand the necessity, but some (many) podcasts play the same ad up to three times IN A ROW. Extremely annoying.",positive
"It's yo good, I can't say anything to increase it",positive
"The best music app, i was a Gaana plus user and recently switched to Spotify. I am very much happy, Spotify app is very much polished and bug free than Gaana and Music recommendations are also spot on.",positive
First time using it. Love it's variety and rich sound!,positive
Easy to use and love all the options for listening pleasure,positive
The quality is excellent but the subtitles is not updated and some were not accurate.,neutral
So very nice is spotofy app,positive
"Props 2 the writer of the short but informative Intel. When u dig into the bands page& read their history. As a metal head during its prime I think ur pretty spot on most of the stories about how the bands portrayed the music in that time and how the fans seen them. The app is great BTW. Been a paid customer 4 about 6 plus yrs. Not sure how long I can hang on being a paid customer, as we all know r country is going 2 hell in a hand basket, only essentials around the corner. Pray 4 us as humans",positive
They hold your downloaded songs hostage unless you pay or uninstall the app. They don't even have permission to my files but they found a way into them I guess.,negative
"On any other phone this would be a 5 star review, I'd just like to bring attention to the fact that the app is barely usable on the Galaxy Note 9. It acts like it doesn't have internet access when it does (regardless of the WiFi or 4G network I'm connected to) and it takes about 5-10 minutes to realize it actually has internet access, then takes another minute or so to load my library.",negative
"While online, stops playing after 10 seconds of 1 in 5 songs. While offline, completely refuses to play 1 in 5 downloaded songs. Constantly forgets which songs I liked. Offline mode sucks. Tapping the 3 dot menu on a song spends 3 seconds trying to load even though there is clearly nothing to load. I can't browse music by artist and album, only filtering the list of all downloaded songs which doesn't even work. Typing an artist's name often onlow shows 20% of their songs I downloaded.",negative
"It's very good and has 100% helped me during meltdowns to calm down. Other than small issues, it's decent. I can't change the playback volume anymore. 3 stars",neutral
"I stopped paying for Spotify because I disliked how many songs were repeated in many play lists 🙄 sometimes they put a song in a playlist if it can be remotely attributed to a genre 😏 wouldn't allow me to revert to free version when they no longer got my money. Or how about I had to pay them and my phone bill at the Same time, so if I'm away from wifi, I have to pay twice to listen to a song...no thanks! All about money",negative
Love the music and my Playlist.,positive
Fun and fast both nastalgic and Inlightning with recommendations.,positive
"I loved the songs,hoping soon the lyrics were available ,im using premium account.",positive
Constantly pauses playback...trash. its 2022 streaming is nothing new there is zero reason for any bs,negative
The best and easiest music option,positive
"Spotify is absolutely awesome,",positive
Current version very glitchy for music playback. 10+ hiccups(micro pauses per song).,negative
You put songs in my playlist that I don't want in my playlist cuz I just want to listen to my music on repeat and won't let me play songs i search for,negative
best songs app :),positive
You can do a lot of stuff but ads pop up a lot,positive
I get to listen to good music and do something also.,positive
"The app freezes and I have to reset it ALL THE TIME. Please, fix this 'cause I love the music quality and the all the app's functions.",positive
Worst app ever. Service provider music player horrible. Dont bother subscribing some how it's worse when you pay monthly does not matter the device. I rather have my phone open and listen to YouTube for free then pay 15$ for this broken garbage,negative
The songs are spirit filled songs they are beautiful,positive
"Great app just missing a few songs., if you can take advantage of 90 free trail. It's worth it for downloading music.",positive
Jkartel is the best artist on Spotify but he's very underrated,positive
No words can express how I love this 😍❤❤❤,positive
Please add option to listen from the beginning when playing podcasts episodes.,negative
Cool. Played for background while bridge ladies were here. They wanted to know about it. So I showed them that I had it on my phone. They loved it.,positive
"I've used Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music, and YouTube Music, and this one is my new favorite music streaming app. I have premium currently. The song radios are seamless and it's easy for the most part to navigate the app. Some things are much more convenient on the PC version, like moving lists of songs from one playlist to another. I'm glad it warns you if you are about to add a song to a playlist that already has the same song, it lessens the likelihood of repeats.",positive
Mind-blowing very lovable app for me 👌😍🥰♥️🔥better sound quality and minimum ads which is good ☺️,positive
"I had problems soon after installing the app. It seems impossible to shut it off completely. I was trying to travel using the Waze app for navigation. Spotify kept playing music unexpectedly interfering with my trip. The only quick solution was uninstall it, so I could safely travel using Waze as intended.",negative
Spotify is best,positive
I love spotify I use it every day,positive
Cannot use the app. When i want to listen to a song it plays an entirely different song that has no connetion to the one i want. If i want to listen to another song on my playlist it wont allow me and it'll keep playing the song i dont want to listen to.,negative
Awesome app. Never going back to other apps,positive
"I have internet connection but spotify wont go online, so i can only play downloaded music. This has happened A LOT of times. I've tried to uninstall it, and reinstall but its not working, i used to work. I'm so mad at this pls fix it! fixed!!",positive
Pretty reliable bad cell service or not,positive
"Used to always crash before. But it's okay now, loving it! Music keeps me sane. Ive heard abt the karaoke feature. Cant wait!!!!!",positive
"Sick of spotify blaming their awful service on customers with ""high expectations."" OH, you are sorry the service didn't work as I EXPECTED IT TO????? I guess it was too much to assume that your garbage app would do anything it said it would, just like you corporate clowns. My bad. Keeps getting worse and worse. Right on the cusp of canceling. I'd rather have no music than deal with this headache.",negative
"I'm going to be discontinuing this service. They play the same songs over and over again on the artist channels. But more than anything, it's their support for that right-wing podcast person and paying him millions of dollars to spew out hatred and the Trump type of ugliness. I definitely prefer calm radio and it's a much better deal",negative
"Bloatware garbage, unsolicited & pushed onto people with Samsung phones just like the Facebook & Netflix apps. Any app/business that forces itself onto customers of other products obviously isn't customer focused, rather it behaves like a scammer. Will never use Spotify again.",negative
Sound comes in and out every 4 seconds or so. I don't have this issue with any other app. I love Spotify but not if I can only listen to music in 4 second intervals.,negative
"I highly recommend using this, no subscription needed to enjoy!",positive
"Great app overall but I don't like how it's different on iPads and phones, I would like to choose a specific song and not listen to only a preview.",neutral
Best music app there is. Legit not one song I haven't been disappointed knd.,positive

Great anytime music app.,positive
Music has always been like a getaway for me and this really has helped me through hard times!!,positive
Spotify is hands down the best music app I've used. It has every song you could imagine and lots of fanmade playlists to enjoy. It also has a fair parental ristriction that still gives a good 70 percent of the music. Defo recommend,positive
My choice of app for music and commentary,positive
There should be just a few more free options,positive
Thise are a very usefull app and it get u all the songs ure looking for from old-school to new generation stuff,positive

It's easy to use. An I have found every artist I pur in,positive
Great app only problem is it is to big for me to keep on my phone Would be good if it was possible to move app to SD card,negative
"Switched from Amazon Music to Spotify, so far I only see improvements, no unnecessary extra subscriptions to listen to my favourite songs. I'll definitely be sticking with Spotify for the foreseeable future. 😁",positive
I like it it plays what I want to hear the music I like to hear you know it plays continually even if I cut the phone off so I do like this app a lot Recommend it for everyone,positive
It has like all the songs. 🎵 It is also super easy to find the song you won't to listen to. There is the perfect amount of ads as well. You can listen to songs anywhere you like.,positive
"All the music I could ever want, and more! It's my understanding that Spotify doesnt censor out dissenting views in podcasts, That is why I signed up. So refreshing to see an organization with integrity!",positive
Sooo glitchy. Doesn't reliably play podcasts. Skips songs on its own. Not very good,neutral

Alot of ads but dose the job,positive
I can listen to all my fav songs And podcasts,positive
This update is so disappointing when I make my own playlist it's suck because of the shuffle and it's start to play some song that I don't even add on my playlist,negative
Lots of ads but other than that it's a great app to use especially if you're not great at making playlist cuz I have lots of those ready to go,positive
If I had chance I wouldn't give one star because too many ads are so disappointing that's why please if you don't want to hear ads repeatedly then don't download this app. The main problem is that after 1 to 2 songs again and again bloody boring ads. The Worst app I have ever downloaded 😑 😒,negative
Easy to use. Great selection.,positive
"I'm giving 4 stars for the music selection. The ads are acceptable but having ads that are as long as a song is not fun. If I choose an album, I'd like to listen to that album and not have other songs inserted. I feel like Spotify has a special team to figure out what would annoy listeners the most so they'll pay for premium which annoys me even more so that's not happening.",positive
"Really good app, new to it , with no prob.",positive
God this app is so annoying like there 10 ads after every 3 songs like wth🙄🙄,neutral
Android app seems to get stuck in a loop when playing a large playlist - about 1000 songs. Seems to repeat 20 - 40 songs over and over. Deleting and reinstalling the app fixes is but only temporarily.,positive
Awesome Always playing this over any station on my Alexa,positive
I use this app all the time. Got it on practically all my devices. But for some reason it stoped worked. Doesn't load anything. Says all playlist don't have anything in them anymore. And it keeps saying it's offline even though I got internet. Ive tried deleting and redownloading multiple times and it still won't work.,neutral
"This app is seriously so buggy. I used to love Spotify but it skips like CD. Well turn off when the screen goes dark (the only reason any of us pay for you tube is to avoid this). Also, I've had the play bar disappear on me and I couldn't pause and play the song. I had to exit the app to turn off audio. I'm getting so sick of it and I've told my husband it's not worth an endless library of songs and podcasts if I can't enjoy listening to them. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled the app, nothing.",negative
"Absolutely awesome app! I've been listening to my liked songs for so long. Spotify doesn't even have a lot of adds. I honestly give the app five stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Edit: this app is great, but I can't play a specific song without having to use my skips, (which are 6 for free listeners) so I took 1 star off. Please fix this",positive

App is trash.. If you can use podcast addict do it. They are awesome. This app crashes glitches stops and starts randomly and denies control at times. If it wasn't for Rogan I'd never have downloaded it.,negative
Wow great app for music,positive
Me and my fiance that's overseas can listen from the same Playlist... it's another way we connect with each other when he's gone...,positive
"there was a drop down thing that I think has recently got removed when you search for a song on the app. it was useful to add a song in a playlist, etc., directly without having to first play the song and sometimes sit there for an ad to get over. it also makes the whole process tedious having to do it with multiple songs. I don't know if this review will be taken into consideration, but it'll be appreciated if it gets reverted back to its earlier state.",positive
I enjoy the choices of artist and songs I can choose,positive
Best Music app have come across! Getting all my favourite music and all i want! Mahn this the best no need of more already this is enough.. is good to go with. Clear sounds too. This 10/10,positive
Constant shutdowns and issues despite updated software and new android.,negative
Started off great. Seems like lately Spotify had been laggy and unresponsive at times. Stops playing music for no reasons. And it's annoying that it ask every time I log in to enable Bluetooth. Debating if I should keep paying for premium 🤔,neutral
"I love Spotify, and all of the great features. If anything I wish I could add all of my liked songs from one artist to a playlist.",positive

"You can't choose specific songs without paying... So this is basically just the radio... Still with ads... There's no reason to use this service ever, can't believe anyone would give them money, I'm afraid to see what their 'premium' service actually offers",negative
Spodify is cool. The only issue is. You cannot play your favorite song on repeat unless you pay. So they'll play music that you're not even interested in which is the biggest con.,negative
Why does this crash constantly?,negative
"when i add songs to queue, only the last added song shows up and then it plays backwards, so, from the last added song",negative
So dumb that you guys were out for a while and silly haven't fixed this app like I pick a song and it puts on another song that just didn't even pick I recommend people to use another app instead of this one,negative
"Even after a new update, spotify never works properly. Now the issue is its not playing podcast videos. Really tired of paying for an app that never works. Cleared my cash, force stopped the app, checked settings allow all data and not save pods as audio only",negative
"After free trial ends it's just a overall trash app😔 but you can fix that by paying premium 👍 after that it's the best music app I promise, but if you don't want to pay for premium I suggest SoundCloud",negative
Not bad great app. Continue promoting the music,negative
It really works. The quality is excellent and the music choices available are abundant. Great App. *****,positive
This app is awful.. I used to love it but it has recently stopped working. I can't do anything on it and there is not way to fix it.,negative
"A good way to hear music we like on the go, at home, at the office",positive
"Easily my favorite music app, Spotify is the best in my opinion. The simple user interface, super deep catalog of music/podcasts and it's well worth the subscription to not hear the commercials 👍",positive
"After getting the 1 month subscription Spotify app on my windows 11 is not working! It shows ""Spotify can't play this right now. if u have the file in your computer you can import it"". I have even tried reinstalling the app but it still acts the same. + All Songs aren't downloading in my mobile!",negative
"Favorite music streaming app. Been using it for years along with Premium and have had little to few problems. Imo, worth the $10 a month. By being a beta tester (which I am as well), you can test new things they're thinking about adding to the app for a short period of time and its quite interesting!",positive
I hate this app. You are too selfish to even listen to the fact that this app is not continuing to play music like it's supposed to when you update this music listening app. It loves stopping in the middle of a song and not keep playing like it's meant to do. This is pitiful for everyone and not enjoyable. I looked for a solution to this problem. But all have failed.,negative
I used my boyfriends card one time to make a payment and they went and took two payments off with out permission. I did not save the card to the account,negative
Love it. No adds just music.,positive
one song one ad of 30 second.... really very dissapointed with spotify... rudiculous way to beg for the money...,negative
"When you play a song, you should see at the bottem which song you are playing and how far you are in the song. But I can't see that anymore please fix this🙏🏻",positive
Incredible 😃 is this for music I love 😘 it all time in this app,positive
I love listening to music when I work read and draw. I love Spotify and the podcast,positive
I'm really really irritated that you only get six skips in your liked list. What if I'm not in the mood to listen to a song that I like? At LEAST give us unlimited skips in our own Playlists. Please. I know I'm not the only one frustrated.,negative
So far it's okay we'll just grab more later when it starts playing a list of songs that I really like,positive
"Like a meth head selling his daughter on the corner do this- 3 month free trail, after 2.5mths make a new email and account then share playlists rinse and repeat (I am poor can't afford a cup of noodles)",positive
Overall the app is great when it works but the daily crashes are an issue,neutral
Great and easy app,positive
Been using Spotify for a decade or so and get nostalgic with some of the songs I've started from back in the day. Thanks Spotify,positive
Dont know if its the song or the app but all im getting are bits and blurbs of songs,negative
Horrible. Why can't I play a Playlist in order without premium. What's the use of calling it a Playlist if its always on shuffle?,negative
Music quality is fine ; decent but for the non premium member its going disappointing day by day .. in my first experience ads appears then after 6 songs now this is after the every 2 songs ... this is not done ... thinking for Uninstall this app ....untill the margin increases to 6 songs 😔 😟 🙁,negative
"The experience is very good and I recommend choosing this streaming service, other fancier streaming services are more expensive but not all phones can handle that quality so that's why Spotify is a good choice for most of the devices out there because only higher end phones are capable of super high resolution anyways",positive
Good app. I can find most of the music I enjoy listening to. However if you do not get the premium you have to listen to a lot of play lists in order to hear the music you like.,negative
Rated it one star cause before we could listen to all songs in the desktop app we can listen to songs normally but in phone after the update we only can preview songs even the ones that were there in my playlist please fix this,negative
"Used to love Spotify, after the last 6months or so it's just been a glitchy mess and every update does nothing to change it getting to the point I want to cancel and find a better service",negative
Worst experience ever I've buyed 1 month subscription and just after that my Spotify is not responding anymore🥲,neutral
I can find what I'm looking for easily.,positive
Superb sound quality Spotify discribed in 3 word SSQ,positive
"I have premium but even then, sme songs can't be played whole offline. For example, the song Cold Cold Cold by Cage the Elephant is gray and when you click on it it says it's unavailable. It's one of my favorite songs and I can't listen to it offline.",neutral
Using for 2 years lately the app is crashing nonstop,positive
Best music app out there. Premium is worth the purchase.,positive
The app is very very nice. I love this app so so much....,positive
"Why can't you find a full list of songs by an artist? They're obviously there as you can search for a specific track and bam it's there, but if you do a general search for an artist only 5 tracks show up",negative
Its out of rhis world. No words ro desscribe. Its an Awesome expeeience,positive
Whenever Im hearing a playlist its always shuffled but the problem is there is no shuffle button. And I couldn't see the songs that were included in the playlist. PLEASE FIX THIS. Its stressing me out.. Edit: I'm sorry I keep whining but please fix this.. Please please please please please please please,negative
It's a very good music app but it would be nice if the lyrics came in Tamil,positive
Love the premium features,positive
This app is not working properly,negative
I give four star because we have to give money for listening to songs add free,positive
Very good and I think everyone can use it,neutral
Seems like lately every time I boot up Spotify it gets stuck on the loading screen or it'll display the song but it just won't play. It's as though it's paused and it'll say that I'm disconnected from the internet despite having signal or Wi-Fi and all my other apps work. Also sometimes when I boot up and it the queue will disappear along with the player that shows the song I was listening to last.,negative
App never works always crashing and lagging I Uninstalled to reinstall and now it won't load,negative
"This is a great app for creating and sharing playlists, discovering new music/artists/podcasts, and releasing your own work. It is definitely worth buying premium.",positive
"I really enjoy the scope of music thats available if you can think of if they have it. Ths one thing that rubbed me wrong was, when I set this up I wanted the family plan? I was unable to set up my wife with Spotify and I hear about it from time to time. I should'nt have to tell you about it here but I couldn't get anyone to help with the setup.",positive
Wynk is more user friendly... After each song ads comes,neutral
I always have service even working in a warehouse if I go out of town. I listen to music like people watch TV. Music is therapy and it's a constant thing in my house. I love the no ads/ commercials either,positive
Too much Ads are there 👎🏻,negative
Great but less advertised,positive
I really enjoy my music. Spotify is the best App.,positive
"It's been great, only issue I may have is, with my one very big Playlist, it still repeats some songs, as though there is only like 20 songs instead of 100, but besides that I enjoy it",positive
Used to love this app to recently. Now I can't play Playlist or artist I look up. Acting up lately,negative
Earlier app was very good and 2 ads come at a tym now 4-5 ads come at a tym and is very difficult to listen on it and network problem is also there,negative
The kareoke option is not working for me.I updated the app but still it doesn't work.It worked only once so I thought of doing it again but I don't have that option now,positive
Best music app I have seen,positive
"Except ads being how bad spotify ads are, this is a good app",positive
This app is more concentrating on ADs rather playing a music...even if you here saying listen music without 30 min interruption still after 5 min you will listen a shirt AD... Why should I purchase your app..only to stop ads..common...only stupid people will buy your app to stop ads...rather I will download songs and hear them,negative
"Great app for music and podcasts. But I want to be able to turn off recommendations (or new releases) or at least close them once I've seen them. I recently got a popup for a podcast with Reba something. I'm not interested. I'm a paying member, I don't want to have to close popups. I want to be able to choose whether to apply the playback speed to one podcast or all. One podcast, I want to listen at 2x another at 1x. I don't want to have to change it every time. Podcast Republic offers this.",negative
"I dont know what the matter is, but this app, it doesn't want to download at all...trust me my storage space is enough for apps twice the size of mb of spotify idk why it doesnt want to download but I've been trying to download it for the past 5days!!!",negative
Too much annoying ads...,negative
"i cant play a song without getting to another song firstly . Like i search for a song to play but then when i tap play ▶️ it comes out another song that i dont know so then i need to skip 2 or 3 songs for it . Pls fix it , i can't hear a song while sleeping :( Overall its okay",neutral
"Recent updates have made the app awful. Always cuts out on Bluetooth, app freezes often and the downloaded songs aren't accessible",negative
I like that I can just pick whatever song or album I want.,positive
It's just amazing. Better than apple music.,positive
"This is an amazing app for music like it's on the top for me but the only problem is with advertisements,like when an ad comes before a song and it says that now you can enjoy the next 30 minutes ads but after one or 2 songs which are not clearly of 30 minutes there is a another ad like it is a straight up scam and this happens all along a huge playlist and to me it is annoying so I hope this can be fixed....... Otherwise I would give 5 ⭐ rating. Thanks",neutral
Best app for listening songs 😃😃,positive
A ton of content for a reasonable price,positive
Can't sort podcasts by language,negative
"Its a good music app, just the fact that they have an ad that says "" 30 minutes with no ads "" which is fake. They wont give u 30 mins without ads. Also they're adding songs to ur playlist, so u will have to waste your skips.",positive
Why is the app version restricting than the desktop version? 6 skips per hour and it doesnt even play songs in the playlist that I created it plays songs randomly,negative
"I just hope you could improve it a bit by including ""related search song""; where you search for a song and it's relation continue to play. Hope you get that?",neutral
"Supposedly downloaded songs keep disappearing even after I've uninstalled then reinstalled the app, it's very frustrating!",neutral
Why can't you guys set it up so i can move it to my sd card. It hogs up too much space on my phone.,negative
It's just an awesome app.it has everything i would want in an app. Keep up the good work!!,positive
I can find specific versions of songs that I can't on any other music streaming service,positive
I have no issues in finding a song. I really like and injoy spotify,positive
Even if YOUR 8 YOU CANT LISTEN TO MUSIC YA KNOW WHAT THAT NOT FAIR LET THEN LISTEN TO MUSIC PLUS IT HAS LESS SONGS,negative
App good ads too bad one or 3 songs after 3 advertised hate this but love app songs,positive
would be great if there's an option for me to change the sequence of songs in the playlist from my phone itself,neutral
Awesome app that's why I am giving 5 stars without ads and clear music and number of playlists than you Spotify ...,positive
"I few songs I couldn't get on there because they were remixes, but otherwise it's great! Not a single ad with premium either😌 it also continues to play the songs when my screen goes off and my notifications don't interrupt!👏",positive
"Spotify use to be a 5 star app, adding lyrics was a great addition, and they have a lot of social media influence. However all the other major streaming apps have some type of high-res streaming subscription offer. Why is Spotify so far behind in this!? Artists spend lots of time creating intricate details in music through Dolby Atmos, and Spotify doesn't even give us a chance to stream it that way. Saying they're working on it while other companies have already rolled it out. Let's catch up",negative
"It's amazing but as a beginning artist is not too fair, still couldn't live without it. Luvz on Spotify",positive
"Spotify is an outstanding music platform, with different genres for all types of music orientated people. Signed G",positive
Superb App it is very amazing sound quality also superb and no network issue it work in village area also I give 5 star,positive
I am getting ad based on my location but I want ad only in Hindi or English is there not any solution for it?,neutral
Love this app! Best music app around!,positive
"Great! Only thing I'd change is allow for additional audio equalization in-app in addition to my android device's settings, to boost certain frequencies a tad more. Overall, though, great experience.",positive
"Great app., good Music.",positive
"AUGH THAT WAS CRAZY, I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED THAT SORT OF ATMOSPHERE IN AN APP BEFORE, ITS ABSOLUTE ELECTRIC, THE PASSION, EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD.",positive
"Excellent sound, great assortment of music, easy to install and program.",positive
"Great app, makes life happier.",positive
Good quality and consistent play format..my go to app,positive
"If I click to play music on PC, it shouldn't start playing podcast on my phone's speakers! Basic stuff, hire product manager.",neutral
I love it until some@$$ hacked my account and list all my playlist. Ughhh,positive
"Song recommendations were good at first, now they are just repeating over and over again. Just found out that I have followers (W.T.F.?), and I DON'T WANT followers, but I can't remove them, unless I block them. Really really sad about this, I hesitated for a long time in paying for a music app and I'm very disappointed with spotify. 2/5 stars",negative
"Awesome. Keep on rolling with the songs,thank you",positive
"Lately the free version is unusable, two adds after every two songs. I am not going too buy that stuff anyway, and yes, they are the same two adds every time.",negative
One more large downside I've noticed. Can we somehow gain the ability to expand upon only the top 5 songs by a single artist & make it so we can organize a single artists entire list of songs ever by popularity?,neutral
Works well. 30 minutes free of no ads by listening to only 2. All my favorite songs are on here!,positive
"Doesn't work without data. Pretty much useless if you are not willing to use data while out and about. If you have downloaded playlists, and try to switch between them, the songs just never load, and so you cannot access any of your downloaded music",negative
Poor playlist function,negative
This app is good for listening but this app can't allow another app with listening so please fix this problem for make your app better thank you,positive
"Adds song to my playlist and won't let me remove them, THIS APP SUCKS DO NOT GET IT!",negative
Spotify keeps crashing in the past hour and i already try to reinstall but it doesnt solve the problem,negative
"Quite easy, not at all what I expected. But, as they say never expect have hope.",positive
"I mean, I get premium for 10$ so I'm happy. I wouldnt want to pay more though",positive
"Ads are too many, too often, and too long. Very annoying and you can't fast forward thru the commercials.",neutral
"awful app. if you need to buy premium just to play the songs you want, might aswell put Spotify not for free. because i cant even listen to the songs i want to listen and could only skip 6 songs an hour.",negative
I love Spotify premium. I get to add whatever songs I like with no ads. And I love that you can download your music to listen offline. This is my second month and I love it.,positive
Very good music app,positive
"This new update is changing inside the Spotify, everytime I play my liked song, it only play for 10 second only, unlike the old Spotify, everytime I tap my Like song, it always play the full. I want the old Spotify, this new Spotify is bad.",negative
This app's ui is worst then any other app. It always show shows you might like with irrelevant content. And we also can't remove the listens and unliked content from the home menu. It shows nudity type shows . And we can't remove this type of shows from our Spotify home menu. I hope you'll understand.,negative
Really good music app,positive
Multiple charges...each month i get multiple charges for Spotify on my CC...I try to investigate and can NEVER get an answer. There is no email address to which I can request details. Until this is resolved...this will remain at 1 star...less if i could. Update: still no reply from Spotify and there is no easy way to cancel...so I will do a charge back on my c/c...I have uninstalled,negative
Best ever app for listening either latest or old songs and also podcasts,positive
"I love this app,i think i have seen a music app like this",positive
The game is good but if i play my song its not the song i wanted but the app is still good😁,positive
I love this I can save the music that I listened 💗,positive
Best music experience ever,positive
Awesome Features! Amazing music!,positive
"The app doesn't even work, as it doesn't allow me to listen to the music I want to listen to, but instead makes me listen to random songs I've never heard before. Most terrible and useless app I have ever seen. And on top of all of this, they prevent you from doing things such as skipping more than six times per hour, and puting songs on repeat, unless of course you're willing to pay. You've lost a user, since money is obviously more important to you than user convinience.",negative
Worst app ever can never skip back to your song and if you click play it continues with whatever it skipped to and that's stupid also u can only skip so much times worst app experience ever rating -100,negative
Just ads ads and ads . Ads > music 🤮,negative
Why does the lyrics share button keep disappearing?,positive
"Horrible app, you cant play songs, when you do it just doesnt work, though the ads are not too bad, would rather use youtube because i can CHOOSE what song i want to play, absolute L",negative
"Good quaility sound, and easy to acces to.",positive
Best app i ever seen but there are not perfect remix version,positive
"Ads after every song? Not to mention the ads are priority as they don't take time to load off my CELL DATA, yet the song buffers here and there as loading it's data isn't priority over and data. Oh also nice false advertising, ""get 30 minutes and free after listening to these ads"" I measure the time, and it gets shorter each time, first time it was 27 minutes before an ad, then 22, eventually I measured it lower but can't remember. Good job Spotify, you're throwing yourself away.",negative
Good app but ads are so annoying,neutral
Idk what happens to the app everything I search is just buffering with full network,negative
Used to love this but can't even use it now. It doesn't play anything anymore. Says no internet when all other apps working fine on net. All playlists are apparently now empty. I am paying for a service i can't use. NOT HAPPY AT ALL. Fix this now or lose more customers.,negative
Thank you so much for fixing the bugs!!!❤️❤️,positive
Very cool app because I can not getting back With Another Event and I will be there at about the same as the one I have is a good time to come by and look at your schedule,positive
Too many ads..after every song an adds start playing it's very annoying.... And their it is said that after this as you can enjoy 30 minutes uninterrupted music but it's not true......,negative
It's good but doesn't work with weak WiFi signals,neutral
"After I finish hearing all of my song in playlist, it keep playing other songs out of my playlist. And when I skip it will play another songs out of no where and I kindly hate it.",negative
I like the app because it is good for listening to music but there is just kn one issue I have I keeps signing me out of my account randomly and it is quite hard to get back into it when does this. Can you please fix that one issue.,negative
Works well and customer service is great,positive
Easy to use. Have had alot of fun with. Even able to put my podcast on my roku TV.,positive
"The app is very good for listening music,but the lyrics spellings are totally mistaked,so please check the issue",positive
Listening to my favorite songs is easy and without adds.,positive
"Buggy, cumbersome, and lacks standard features. I used to enjoy having all my podcasts in one place, now I need to use your bloated, battery hungry app. Your garbage app autoplays podcasts even with autoplay off. Your garbage app plays ads at annoying times, ruining the moment on many occasions. Hate you Spotify.",negative
This is becoming the worst app day by day. After 2 to 3 songs we just hear the advertisement of buying premium spotify . You even don't know how to attract the customers you are just disturbing their enjoyment. we don't want to buy the premium Spotify but still you are just adding advertisement which is disturbing the customers and I am sure that all the customers will delete this app because of this and you have already got 4.3 ratings and it will take no time to convert into 3.,negative
"Its a very awsome app and i have got all of my childhoodcollection on your app,i felt so good refreshing my childhood memories,however the drawback is the subscription part.",positive
"I can't even play any song I like, like fr when I pick any song and try to play It, It already has this annoying Shuffle Play Button😒",negative
All the music you need!,positive
"It's amazing, but the ads and can't download part is the only sad thing",neutral
Excellent music selection,positive
They try hard to make the ad paid version useless to tic you off and force you to go premium. I shut the ap off and use other avilable services when it does this.,negative
I really really hate the adverts and you can't even mute the volume,negative
Best streaming platform,positive
Best music platform for sure,positive
The Spotify app is very user friendly and the Google Assistant incorporation makes it very easy to play my favourite music wherever I am.,positive
There is a great choice of music for the seniors and the quality is good too. Hope we will see more and more choices esp in the traditional indian music categories. Thank you and keep up the entertanment.,positive
It is only good on premium or on PC. And if you don't have premium it is just annoying not just with the ads but with just trying to listen to a full song. You can't just go look for a song and play it you have to put it in an album which is on shuffle meaning it just plays them at random unless you have the PREMIUM. Basically just get the free trial and move on or get the PREMIUM.,negative
"Still waiting for Podcasts and Canvas feature to be enabled in my country. Nevertheless, good app if you're premium.",positive
Every songs N music available .just love it,positive
It's awesome app I really love it ..❤,positive
"spotify shouldnt add songs to playlists for you, its really annoying and they should make it a setting.",neutral
Alot better tha i always thought it would be. Whats really neat is this cool way they choose songs for you when ur playlist end . enjiy cause i do.,positive
TOO MANYYYYY ADDSSSS.. UNNECESSARY SPOTIFY IS PUTTING ITS OWN ADDS JUST TO CONVINCE US TO PAY. UNACCEPTABLE.,negative
Everything I was told about a music getaway as therapy is right on Spotify.... Can't even lie about it. 🎧,positive
The app is good and has thousands of songs to choose from including podcasts and other types of audio experiences. The 14 day free trial was nice as the standard premium is only $9.99 making it pretty cheap for the average user.,positive
Easy and fun to use credit to the creators of this app,positive
Makers of this app you did a good job but for favorites it deletes your song if there is more than 28.I sugest you guys look at what the problem is.The rest of the time it is easy to use and is one of the best music apps ever,positive
Please bring back the notif button for offline mode. Huhuhu. i'll give you 5 stars if you do that 😊,positive
Anyone having issues with music cutting in and out while hooked to blue tooth?,positive
Everythings good expect 2 issues i face. 1 we can arrange tge song in playlist manually. And 2 the worst one is too many ads.even they we can listen 30 minutes which is the biggest lie.you will face ad after every single song and most of the time 2 ads back to back which is too much annoying and mood spoiling most of the time.seems like this app never made to be free. Plz plz just stay on your talks.that will be enough for us hope u understand 🥺🥺 Plz guys like this review so it can be on top,negative
Excellent......I request the music.....it gets played. Whatever music. It hasn't been stumped yet.,positive
Ads should be limited,positive
"Most people are saying its bad for some reasons, but its actually very good, its a very good app for listening to music, songs, podcasts and ect. For me personaly its the best music app that i have ever used.",positive
"Amazing app! Always streams well, and the settings are advanced. Would recommend making playlists for those of us that are picky about music lol. If you stream from the artist it will throw other artist's songs in as well.",positive
I need help everytime i pick a song i want it plays a different song please fix this bug :(,negative
A very nice app worth having by any loving music fan,positive
This is so freaking bad. I have tried to play the songs i want but it puts anyother song. Spotify is so OVERRATED. that was an year ago but now spottify is great. I was just dumb im keeping it because its funny,positive
Great access to incredible music,positive
"Poor Server Performance. Number of ADs have increased, and for the rest of time the app is just ""loading"". My home WiFi is 100mbps and still the app doesn't play without buffering.",negative
Logs me automatically into the wrong account and I can't change it. So I can't use my premium membership. So I'm deleting the app. Was a good 4 years.,negative
I listen to specific podcasts on this platiform. The android update really seemed to not be a good companion to this app. what i dont like is how this app plays continuously and randomly...there's no way to stop it with out going into Apps and forestopping. it drains my ear buds and battery...cant fast forward or rewind. ..does not track the last podcast you.listened to. i keep trying to mess with the settings but for some reason there are limited setting options in the free version.,negative
"I suggest App developers reduce ads! It was too much and it made me quite angry when I only heard about 3 songs and the ad appeared while the ad said: ""You will be listening to music for the next 30 minutes"". It's a lie! But these songs are great! Only minus 2 stars because of Ads. ;))",neutral
I just love Spotify best for kpop music it is in my heart now ❤️❤️ but ads 🌚 make it less,positive
"I like it, find new music all the time",positive
there awesome but the only thing that is not good is that you have to have data or internet so if your traveling and don't have data you can't play music.,neutral
I enjoy listening to my podcast thru Spotify its easy and I enjoy. Just listening with the no video option.,positive
So I have had enough of paying premium Spotify when the past 2/3 months everytime I play Spotify and then lock my phone it stops working have been through all my setting. Have been hoping that the updates that I do help but nope. Getting real sick of it,negative
7 ads in one go that's too much,negative
Best app for music ♥️♥️,positive
There are many lengthy ads. only 1 short ad will be appreciated.,negative
I love it..its the only music app that i take with me wherever i go,positive
I have hundreds of songs but the app just plays the same ones over and over. I can skip ahead to try to play new ones and it can play the same one it did a few songs ago.,negative
Upgraded my phone to a s22 plus and now the option of seeing the songs that I have liked by a specific artist is gone. Now I have to search through the artists entire library to find what I want,negative
"Best music app there are ads but, you can find those songs which you can't find anywhere",positive
Still love it. Top of my charts.,positive
When I play the song that I like it played a different song,negative
I love this app very much 🥰 I really recommend this app to music lovers ☺️ it's really satisfy to listen songs in this app thank you 😊,positive

Very nice aap. Good music app,positive
"😢😢😢😤😤😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬Ads,,Ads,ads, ads ,and data data Full resived, don't open 👐",negative
To many ads,positive
Somehow you managed to have a consistently inconsistent experience between app and desktop app. Why can't I open my Friends Mix even after adding it to my library??? Why are Blend stories only accessible in the app???,negative
Not sure what time to change the same thing nevermind it mean when your base is so beautiful,positive
It's pretty neat. I sometimes get random ad drops during the middle of a song. The app that can be downloaded is a bit janky for chrome. Still a pretty good service tho.,positive
Contacted the support team and they resolved my lyrics issue in few days! Thank you!,positive
Love listening to music all the time,positive
Spotify is the best app,positive
"first off this app isn't free at all i mean with features like being able to skip 6 songs per hour,pushing songs in your playlist by force, and not being to play exat song one by one in your favorite list and not being able to making a song go forward or anything you are forcing users to buy the premium. Don't even let me start it on ads that you have to listen to 3 or 2 ads after two songs .i think you write down LIMITED ACCESS instead of FREE USE.",negative
"I HATE IT that Spotify has to add their horrible recommendations to my playlist! This is absolutely stupid and plays songs from artists I don't even care about. I made a playlist to listen to 1 artist only, not a mix of unrelated artists. No wonder people are deleting your stupid app when you do things like this.",negative
"Has just about every artist or song I am looking for. Makes personalized playlist and stations just for me.keeps up with the 13,000 songs I have",positive
Awesome I love it the various options to choose from,positive
"Many years already, also they helped me out with a hack that subscribed to premium when I lived in a country with no spotify.",positive
This is awesome with no adds.. I rate this 5stars,positive
Outstanding music app! Ads are one thing but amazing spirit overall,positive
Cannot properly play filter saved songs.,positive
Superb This app is Full clash of my dipression I'm happy when I'm install this app,positive
When i study i will show it and it's main good point is when our device is off ....no prblm Song will play🥰🥰❤️,positive
"Best invention ever and if you are not on Spotify, I don't know what you are doing with your life.",positive
No ads mean no ads yet they still push music calling it a new release when it's just an paid ad for some random song. It's like some other streaming sites like Paramount Plus. They take your money for no-ad plan and run their own promos before the actual content. Promo is an ad!,negative
"Cant pick what you want, Forces songs you dont want on playlists, Etc... It's very bad",negative

Deleting this app. Thumbs down for introducing ads.,negative
"It sucks, you can barely listen to the music you want because of shuffle, you only get 6 skips, on pc its good so i am giving 2 stars, and ads just ruin the experience, not even youtube or sound cloud has that many ads and in those you can skip as much as you want",negative

Spotify fell off like u can't forward the song and can't skip the song more then 6 times an hour and to top this all off u can't play a specific song and when they say listen to uninterrupted music for 30 mins after watching the short video they only play 10 minutes of music,negative
"How is there not an option to remove certain tabs like ""shows to try""or ""stay up to date""? The whole point of spotify is finding music that you like. I don't want to be spammed with the newest Trap or Pop or whatever. It is seriously off-putting.",negative
That was good experience🤭 but my mom doesn't allow me to listen songs thats why I delete it 🤣,positive

I have Spotify premium and its anamzing app with or without it. I love listening to my favorite songs on here. I love that I can connect it to my Alexa speaker so I can play music to go to sleep to.

Love the app!!!,positive
"My issue is that I not able to listen to the podcast episodes that I downloaded. Every day I go into "" your episodes "" section, and I see that the ' downloaded' mark is not there, even though I have re-download them yesterday. Could you kindly tell me why is it so? What's the point of downloading podcast episodes, when you have to re-download them every single day ? Other features are working just fine.",negative

What's with the automatic pausing?,negative
"Great app for the last 5 years. Lots has been improved upon but other things... (such as the totally unnecessary removal of the home screen widget for Android users as of 8/7) ..have been not so great. For anyone interested, Google ""Spotify widget removal"" and look for the most recent thread posted by the official Spotify team. Reading the comments there will give you an insight to just how asinine removing this feature was. I will add back two stars to this review once this feature is re-added.",positive
"Still giving ads after subscribing to premium membership. Audacious, disgusting, pathetic!",negative
I love this app it's a great way to listen to music and express yourself the only thing is I wish you didn't have to pay so much to get rid of ads cos the ads are really annoying. Other than that it's amazing,positive
The best platform for music now. I often forget I have a music player on my phone,positive

I love spotify it has all my favorites,positive
"This latest update is awful! I mostly listen to podcasts and almost every time there is a commercial, that has its own time bar, this app marks the episode as done, deletes my spot, marks the episode as done, and moves me to the next. Other times, episodes with no commercials just end, often times with over an hour left in them. It just skips to the next episode, marks my current one as finished, and deletes my spot. edit: Fixed",positive
It adds terrible music to your own playlist without permission,negative
Music kept me entertained very much ☺️☺️😜😜😜😜,positive
Best free music and postcard app,positive
Pay for premium & Podcast still have automatic ads on top of a podcasts sponsor too. We are entering the age of none stop ads.,negative
"Awful, Spotify enables annoying features like autoplay without telling you. Also, after completing the song you were listening to, it gives ""related"" songs that aren't even slightly related to the original genre.... Best yet, you can't even disable it no matter how hard you try. There are some ways to fix this but that's just so much hassle to basically just listen to a regular ol music player on loop.",negative
Love the music from different artists all over the world.,positive

When I first learned about Spotify. I tried it and I was very happy. Because I listen to music all the time. It relaxes my soul. You have a variety of music to choose from. And how ever list you want to make. Since my husband passed away. My Spotify got cut off . My funds were short couldn't afford it. I was going crazy. The other apps I didn't care for them . I had to have my Spotify. So who's ever ready this try it. Believe me you'll love it. Now I pay it up for three months at a time. Mrs W.,positive

I never had Spotify till about a month ago & I enjoy everytime I use it. 5 star all the way.,positive
You used to be able to set up a playlist even without prime. But these days no go without them shoving their own songs onto your playlist. You also can't repeat a song or playlist. Pandora is looking better and better. You also can't see your playlist without moving back and pushing 5 buttons. It makes you work too hard. Very frustrating.,negative
"Superb app,but if you add shuffle option for playlists,it will be more helpful.Thankyou",positive
It's good for music use it almost every day it's confusing how to change plans but it's fine alot of different music and it recommends hood artist from my taste I've told my friends about it I love it easy to work easy to look for music alot of ads if you have standard edition so I would recommend premium,positive
"Okay so I've been trying to play some music but I doesn't work and plays a random song. It all started when I was in my like list and I was trying to play a song but a different song would be playing instead of the song I wanted. I made a new account and the same thing happened so now I can't listen to the music I want to hear, instead some random song that isn't even in my likes. I was trying to play the song 'Misery Meat"" but, it didn't work and a random song appeared.Please fix this I hate it",negative
"I love the app, but for some reason my music is skipping when played through my bluetooth earbuds. #Edit: Uninstalling and reinstalling the app fixed the problem.",neutral
Very good app just needs some minor tweaking in the consistency of audio quality however other than that adds are minimal for non paying. Users and premium is worth its price.,positive

"Nice App, we can listen all type of songs , without mobile screen on",positive
"It's good and all, but now ads are over a minute long, and no matter what Spotify adds songs into your playlists and it's annoying. This app is never going to be worth $10/month. Back to Youtube Music it is. Spotify has disappointed me AGAIN.",negative

Because it won't play the right song and I don't wanna pay,negative
"Travelling in and out of service, like I do daily, creates trouble. I'm not skipping a ton of songs, and when I do it's usually music I have already downloaded. It still creates minutes of time where the app can't function. I shouldn't have to be checking my app when I'm driving, no matter where I am. Also, I have had five replacement phones since I committed to Spotify for life. Every time, it forgets my preference to never have the visuals. I shouldn't have to turn this off on an audio app.",negative
Been using Spotify as my primary source for streaming music for roughly 8 years now. I've even started my own channel. Only one thing I can't figure out how to delete a private Playlist,positive

Spotify started off great but...days later came out bad it won't let me listen to my favorite song on favorites list.and it only makes me shuffle :(,negative
"I wish I started on Apple Music or YT music. Spotify shuffle plays the same songs all the time. I have about 1000 songs and it always plays the same 50 on shuffle.

Smooth jazz easy to use,positive
Glitchy as hell. I'm constantly restarting the app because it freezes. Basically unusable on my LG V60. Time to cancel?... Get it fixed or get bent. Update: I have now canceled Spotify due to their total lack of interest in fixing their garbage app.,negative

"With every update this app seems to get worse. Frequent crashes are very annoying. Often when I pick something to play, the app will say ""Spotify is trying to play..."" but it is playing the audio I want, but without the controls to pause/fast-forward/rewind being available. To fix this I have to close the app multiple time and re open it. Spotify is awesome, but the app flat out sucks now.",negative

I've paid for this for a while and the moment the payment is late or didn't go through for bank or centrelink reasons it goes back to please update payment. Maybe Spotify needs to improve that for it's regular and long term customers. I won't be using Spotify anymore,neutral
"I'm glad the pause button got changed back to where it was before. However, I've been trying to do this new super grouper thing, it glitches out when you search for an artist and no names come up (my internet has full bars so it's not that).

"Great way to peruse discographies of artists that I love. The (Artist) Radio versions of playlists is better than Pandora's giving more suggestions of similar artists. I love the lyrics feature. It helps to quell the need for a larger & more robust content usually only on a Vinyl LP (still my pref for total package). Love that 12"" format. ;) I'd like to see links to buy any album or single currently playing. Let's give back $$$$$ to the creators of this music & keep this great app sustainable!!",positive

spotify can extract local files in sd card storage for offline listening,positive

I love the music options and dont mind the ads would give this app a 5 star but sometimes when im listening to music and it would turn it self off in the middle of a match or a tournament and restarts the music and pauses it forcing me out of my game just to turn it on again then when it switches to another music it stop again just annoying and would like to play my games with music on helps me relax be sides that its a good app,neutral

It would help the app to have better playlist management. 1. Currently in the app there's no one place where I can find all of my playlists (or I don't see it). My playlists gets mixed up with all of the other playlists I have liked. 2. I might want to add a song to multiple playlists. We should be able to select all the playlists we want to add the song at once. Either check boxes by default or long press for check boxes. 3. Custom order option for library too.,positive

"Despite being a new installation on a phone less than a month old, it has started having the same issues I was having on my previous phone. It will randomly stop playing and show 'nothing playing' rather than the podcast or song I have had on.

Do the Youtube thing where you can add a song to multiple playlists at once. And, make Russian Doll playlists. As in, so you can make an ultimate playlist. Anytime I add a song to these playlists, it automatically adds to this other overarching playlist. That would simplify things a lot so I'm not constantly having to manage all my different playlists.",positive

Nice app but premium adds are not good,positive
Best music app I've ever had!,positive

""Car View"" was a feature that existed up until 2021 where it was ultimately removed in November. This was a SIGNIFICANT FEATURE for users without the newer car play and android auto. This feature single handedly improved safety when driving as the buttons were big enough to press. This was not a good change.",neutral

I love it so much that I have more than 2000 songs in my Playlist and liked one's I recommend this app for for kids,adults and old ones .....everyone would love it .but just reduce the ads plz the only reason I'm giving 1 stars less is of the reason having so much ads rather than songs.

Spotify is affordable and has all the music you could want...but MY GOD IS THIS THING SLOOOOOOOOOW!

The free mode has its limitations, though, and you can only listen in shuffle mode. Songs also have lyrics which are synced in real-time so you can sing your favourite tunes.",positive

Spotify runs ads on premium and if you cancel your premium while you have time left on premium spotify will overwhelm you with ads about staying premium. It also crashes constantly and reset your listen time on podcasts regularly,negative

Ads is over inthe app stop first ads just a music player no ads player okey,negative
"the non-premium experience is horrible to the point of that it should not even exist.

If you dont enjoy using the service please uninstall the app, it really goes a long way to hurt the company",negative

Non stop problems with app crashing or it just starts skipping songs and podcasts. Also after you listen to the ads it will glitch and start the ads over again several times. If it wasn't for Joe rogans podcast I would have given up on this app a long time ago,negative

Everything in this app is okay but ads are the major issues .. I m not saying to close it but decrease the timings ......,positive
"Great price to have access to a lot of different media with good audio quality. My dislikes are that the app itself sometimes takes a while to run , even while you have premium the app while go haywire and sometimes won't let you listen to downloaded music offline All of this is fixible if you know how but what makes me upset is how much effort it sometimes takes to get listening parties to start working , it'd be easier to break into my neighbors house.",neutral
"Its better than wynk or gaana , it has the best playlist",positive
Idea- your organization should make where it only shows ads after you run put of skips.,neutral
I like the app very much... Good for listening songs &have a good quality of sound 👌👌,positive
"Showing offline while using spotify in wifi. My wifi is not the problem. This issue occurs when i try to play music from a downloaded playlist. Spotify comes back online when i switch to mobile data and goes back online when connected to wifi.

Please rectify this ASAP.",negative

Spotify as we all know was great. WAS up until this new update I can't pick songs and I thought picking a Playlist would work but nope songs I didn't even add are on it. I didn't even know this update was a thing up until I got a new phone cause on my tablet and laptop I don't have to worry about this. Literally the only reason people use Spotify is to avoid this. If we wanted to not know our next song we'd use Pandora,negative
Very nice music app like it,positive
It's a fine app. One complaint is I can't put a sleep timer on during an ad.,negative
Great app for music!,positive
Easy access to found favorite music,positive
PLEASE ADD: option to add whole playlists to Queue after 4yrs this is the only annoying thing!! *** If paying subscription fee of it is 100% advert free (adverts drive me insane!!!)& you can play your music in the order you like. You can also put your songs into a queue which is easiest to do when you want to listen to a whole album as you just click on album cover & then click add to queue however it is way more time consuming if you want to listen only to particular songs and / or playlists.,neutral
This is good AP I have ever use but their are some gilch so Spotify have to fix it,positive
Great...many thanks that I can listen here to the best classical music!,positive
"Same problem as everyone else using the free version, they've updated Spotify to force people to pay up or go home.",negative

One of the worst app i have ever used. Even though I had a a wifi with good internet speed but my songs just buffer and buffer. My eqilizer is turning off the second I leave the app. It's getting worse day by day and the amount of adds they had put between the songs are overkill. After every 1or2 song's there is an add. Deleting this app.,negative
I love Spotify it's my life I wish I had premium though it would be soooo much better but I'm broke lmao 😭,positive
When i Click an song it shows different song its annoying I hate it Worst app i have installed tbh,negative
"Inspite of using the premium version, you can't see all the song in one simple list when you type the name of the artist. It's so inconvenient to look for songs album by album. Horrible UX",negative
Great Music Service App.,positive
They solved my problem after mentioning here thankyou Spotify,positive
This app isfree music videos fancing too much latest songs this app has ads problem this app very easy to use,positive
"3 songs 12 adds, I understand theirs premium but thats a bit much for free users. A Song is around 3-5 minutes each, 12 adds is 6 Minutes, I had 2 Songs worth of adds. And how often is the 30mins of no adds as I would think after 12 adds Ishould get that.",negative
I liked it when I first download it I could fast forward or go back in the song and when I looked at the song I could play that song now I can't even get the song that I want when I click on it I get a whole different song and there's ads now and I can't even fast order or go back and when the songs over I can't even go back to the song,negative
"PLEASE let me, a paying subscriber, remove the constant suggestions for podcasts. I must have accidentally started playing a podcast and now all I get is relentless push notifications whenever that podcast and similar ones I have equally no interest in have new episodes come out. Please let us, the user, have more control over what is forced down our throats.",negative
"The app is borderline useless, won't continue reliably playing music with the screen shut off. My podcast wont download. When they do play (particularly The JRE), they randomly skip to an old episode, and lists the one I was listening to as fully played, so I loose where I was in a 3hr podcast. These issues prompted me to end my premium account subscription. Very poor performance, and no options for support. Personally I am incredibly disappointed in the Spotify app. Full stop.",negative
Its been pretty easy to use but there are some songs that are not on spotify that i want to listen to,positive
It's a great platform for streaming your favourite,positive
"I'm now having issues with every song I play pausing in the middle of the song, it happens a few times per song too. Very annoying when your trying to exercise to music! What's going on Spotify? I don't pay for no ads to have the music pause for a few secs each time. Might be time to find a new music app.",negative
"Continues advertisements comes in the middle of song, not even able to listen one song property, whenever I wanted to change the song there will be advertisement plays. I know I have to get premium for avoiding ad but it's very useless without premium",negative
"I can't even choose the songs I want to be played,And there's an unbelievable amounts of ads. First two weeks were amazing,and with the free subscription it was plain horrible. It's all a cash grab after a while.",negative
Has everything perfectly at the tip of your fingers. Why go elsewhere,positive
"This app just to be fine With the latest update I keep getting disconnected no matter how close I am to my modem or how many signal bars I have, interrupting my songs 2 to 4 times per song. I can't even see what I am playing on the notification bar on android and I have not figured out how to see what I am playing in the app. This app just to be so intuitive and easy to use and now it's riddled with issues.",neutral
"Amazing app, best best Im fed up with jio savan , there is lots of add... I like it very much Spotify Love love love",positive
Son unfortunately is unable to afford the price so I have offered to pay half. And the changes spotify added make getting to my Playlist difficult... I prefer the original easier to maneuver site... Plus with my limited income makes it difficult to afford on SSI,negative
"It's good for playing music, but when tracking pocast episode it's a nightmare. You have to scroll down so far if you accidentally add a unplayed episode to the played one. The filters doesn't really help in navigating. I think it could be better",negative
Great experience with the app every music and artist is available for your liking,positive
It has too many addsಠಗಠ,negative
YAYYY IM SO GLAD THEY ADDED BACK THE FEATURE I REALLY LOVE SPOTIFY EVEN IF IT HAS ADS,positive

It always says I'm offline even on a super fast network & search doesn't work. It makes the app useless. This started in the recent builds from last 10 days or so Apart from that Amazing app. You have the fastest streaming service I have used really amazing.

For a subscription service. Why am I listening to commercials in podcasts?,neutral
"I liked the app until the newest version. The older version in my opinion better. 6 skips an hour really? The songs that get added to the Playlists are the most annoying, they never end.

Im not the only one here that wants this fixed too.)",negative

After inspecting their website for answers, I resolved the issues by running diagnostics and such, and never really had problems again. I very much so recommend this app, especially when you use their premium subscription.",positive

"Having been on spotify for as long as it's been available in my country, I find its current state discouraging. Premium plans are very expensive when you're likely also using up your mobile data (yes, download is a thing - but what of music recommendations? what of phone storage?), but the ads on the free plan are unbearable. In the past, you would get a 30s ad for 30m of music. Now, you get five 20s ads, two songs, rinse, repeat. It's ridiculous. Unusable if not for bandom/k-pop goal purposes.",negative

"I use Free. I don't mind the ads, though they seem to have doubled recently so now sometimes it's 4 consecutive ads every 2-6 songs. I DON'T MIND ADS. So why can't I play an album without it shutting down for no reason; won't even allow you to play any album more than a couple of times? I'm willing to suffer ads and recommended songs but you deny me my album anyways? Remind me: what's the point? Otherwise a good app just not inclined to pay when I'm being shorted up front.",negative
I love this app as it has all my fav songs,positive
"Enjoy Spotify, easy to use and find songs",positive
App keeps opening when I restart my phone. Not cool. No setting seems to address this issue and there was nothing in the support section. I don't care enough to log in and email for help so Uninstalling is all I am left with. Oh well.,negative

Always on point and convenient as a premium member I don't use anything else but Spotify,positive

Love the ability to find obscure things that I can't find anywhere else.,positive
"I absolutely hate this app. The adds very very irritating. I know you are trying to force people to buy sprtify premium but enough is enough. Adds come almost after every 2 song. And not just one add, it's 2 adds. This is horrible. Trying to force customers into buying premium by irritating them while they listen to music.

Endless Pleasure for the music lover in u ! I wish I could skip more than 6 songs sometimes you just want to hear only your favs why the need for control 😟,positive
Very excited about music choices,positive
Love spotify ♥. The family plan is affordable and the sound quality is always booming on my speakers. Everyone can hear when I'm coming down the road! I will never leave them.,positive
"As of late when I play music or a podcast there is no interface for what is playing. This leads to the fact that there is no way to pause or skip. So if I want to pause, I actually need to close the app now. Hopefully this gets fixed.",negative

"So great. Subscribed now. Best thing. Listening own playlist while reading, gaming, dancing, dating. The best. Up to date podcasts, music, Sigrid, Devon Cole, etc. Couldnt ask for more. I'm in.",positive
Brilliant app. 👏 Lately the mobile app has been bugy (getting mixed on device sync). Would be great if could add lyrics to songs in your playlists (i.e. songs in less popular languages has too less lyrics). It would be great if you could share a song to your follower(s) within the app. Thanks,positive
I love the app as much as spotiq,positive

"very nice app, however I don't know if it's just my phone but it will randomly stop playing music and pretty much refresh the app if I'm on a different app/game with spotify music playing which is really annoying and leaves me to have to go continuously back and forth from app to app to get the music to continue playing.",positive
I have had this app since 2012. In the last week it no longer will download songs and play them offline. It's weird. I will be canceling all 4 of my accounts. I prefer YouTube music instead. I problem cleared up. I bought a kenwood stereo that has spotify on but will not properly connect not matter what I do. Apparently no one can. Wasted opportunity on kenwood and Spotify. Seems like everything is half-assed now,neutral
I don't listen to music everyday so i can't nitpick tecnical thing about this app m here only to rant about their irritating technique to force us to take the prime membership.....i mean come on man is it mandatory?obvsly no everyone know this .......then why make it sooo annoying by putting an ad after every single song......atleast give us 30min nonstop song as it was before that would be enough for us.... M not stopping u from doing ur advertisement but have lil bit of pity on us......,negative
I enjoy that the ads aren't very long,positive
Very good and nice app for music,positive
It so nice to listen to your own favorite songs and lyrics too😊,positive

I listen to Spotify every day. Podcast mostly. I love that I can always find new stories. Very interesting. Keeps me coming back daily for more.,positive
Overall great experience but to many ads if you don't want to pay for premium.,positive
I can appreciate the ability to set up a bundle of music you can enjoy for hours.,positive
I've always loved this app but for the past couple of days it's been giving me issues it shows I have liked songs but when I click on the liked songs folder it says no liked songs I tried logging out and logging back in but that didn't work all I wanted to do was make a Playlist,neutral
"Grate service, still can't get sertin songs same as apple",positive
Pay to win app basically. I can't play ONE song. Like it only shows a 5 seconds preview of how it sounds. I can't even listen to any songs on my playlists. There is no point it's a PAY TO WIN APP,negative
I have spotify premium and failed to pay my subscription on time. I was given a few days to update my payment details before my premium expired and hence didnt lose my downloads. Thanks a lot for this!,positive
It's free therapy 🤷‍♂️ besides the ads- 🗿,positive
"I have the paid version of Spotify, and along with the YouTube-Pro app it's become one of my most used apps! For anyone still buying albums/singles on CD, give Spotify a try and you'll soon realise this is the way forward in 2022. If the ads annoy you, get the ""pro"" version, it's worth EVERY penny. For the cost of a SINGLE ALBUM each month, instead of just one album you get almost EVERY album ever made! Seriously, give the paid version a try! Without ads it's so much better! 10/10",positive

"Absolutely love Spotify. The best 10 dollars a month I've spent. Everything has a choice here. Hi-fi or low-fi music. I have Bose cube speakers and using Bluetooth with an app for bass boost and equalizer the music is intoxicating. I have 100 Playlist and EVERY CD ever made is accessible here. Journey, Def Lepard, Van Halen, Winery Dogs, Alter Bridge, Slash, Seal, etc. Sounds amazing in hi-fi. MUST use an app for equalizer and bass boost. Thans Spotify. I never have to buy any cd",positive

"Great app, but I should be able to skip as many times as I want and play whatever I want without have to pay for premium.",neutral
I feel like their should not ever be suggested songs it is so annoying and wastes your skips 🙄 fix it and my rating will go to 5,negative
Why do people always act this is a good app when it clearly is a scamming app used to scam people into buying premium so that the app would work but when people buy premium nothing changes and the user gets very annoyed and writes a complaint only for it to get removed so it can have a good rating and scam more people.,negative
It gives me peace of mind.i play whatever music which comes on my mind,positive
Really enjoying the app so many albums I haven't heard in years,positive
Older version was better. Used to be able to access playlists from home screen. Now I have to search through the app to find what I want to listen to.,negative
"From a free perspective the app kinda suck with all the ads and having to have internet. A premium perspective is very different, but you still need internet dispite saying you dont.

The free version is great. Just make alot of playlists with a couple songs on it... (Will let you choose which songs you want to hear!) The ads are a little irritating though especially if you're trying to sleep.The paid subscription is very nice and will allow you to listen to most songs (all in the order you want) the only thing that would make it five star is a couple artist's albums aren't on it. Overall amazing.,positive

Nice but I miss being able to download songs pls can I be allowed too? Ohh I realised the only reason I could download things was because I had premium,positive

Very poor integration with driving mode. Consistently plays random and erroneous songs when trying to make a selection using the voice assistant. Spotify pauses the assistant in driving mode when it's narrating outside of Maps. Issues reported time and time again. No fix in sight.,negative

too many advertisements,negative
"Just pretty great, I've got premium and its just lovely. My only real complaint is that sometimes I don't think the shuffle is entirely random but it makes sense why that is.",positive
"I honestly really don't like this app. On a phone, spotify adds songs to your playlist, FYI I hate the songs they add, YOU CAN'T EVEN LISTEN TO ONE SONG without having to listen to a WHOLE PLAYLIST. SO much advertisements. Ugh i hate it so much. This is a scam you have to download premium to be able to do simple stuff like skip a song or listen to one song. It's literally just a scam for money, I don't reccomend installing Spotify",negative
This app is not for listning song its only for listning dozens of ad,negative
Enjoy my experience with great music,positive

I get that you need cash so I can deal with the ads, but I shouldn't have to pay just to have free choice of music.",negative
Very well composed allow at least 10 downloads.,positive
I used to love this app but after the new update I can barely do anything without premium. It gets really annoying and just makes me want to use it less. Either make it a 100% prescription app or just put it back to normal. Would have rated it five before this.,negative
"Very good, it also gives the information about where the music is being played and who is using ur account and listening to which song and if someone else is using it u can control it by ur device",positive
It is super good! I really recommend this app. But why 4 stars? I love it but I think that it gives too many ads.,positive

Best music app i have ever used no capp🙌❤,positive
My good mood was always destroyed by ads,negative
"It's really good to listen to music, but it is a pain to use. The app doesn't open most times when I try and I have to press library for example, multiple times and wait at least 30 seconds to actually open the page. And every time, it doesn't connect to the speaker, I have to open it again which takes a while, and then it connects. I'm on a galaxy s9",negative

And a lot of podcasts as well. I haven't even tapped into any of the videos they have either because I'm listening to music or podcasts. I say give it a try if you haven't already. No contacts, no commitment. Always a plus.",positive
Kinda BS that I have to watch an ad for 30 minutes of ad-free listening only for you guys to turn around and make me sit through FIVE ads after literally two songs. 😒,negative

"Back in the day, Spotify was really good. You could use the free version, try it out and then decide if you want to buy it or not. A lot of premium functions where on the free version and the only thing you could do with the premium was download the songs. Now days they have become money grabbers. That's the only thing they think of. The free version is unusable. You cannot play a specific song , they add more song to you playlist and force you to buy it. I guess everything is money these days.",negative

After all these years I still can't delete the current song from the playlist that's playing without having to scroll through all songs (1000+) in the playlist to find that one song that's currently playing.,negative
Lots to listen to. I use on long car journeys or while doing dishes or housework or outside pitting clothes out on the line or in the supermarket...Mr Ballan and The African Diaries are my go too but I listen to music and get spiritual inspiration and encourage there also. Pet peeve is that if I pick a music genre the app only plays the first 1 or 2 from my chosen artist or type of music. So I have to keep checking the phone and charging it back to my choice. That's pretty annoying& frustrating.,positive
This is the best app for music. But I'm not able to listen to ANY of Badshah's songs.. like seriously.. it's been like this from a very long time.. but I'm fed-up of it now.. it's a really good app and this is the only app I use for music.. please fix this for me ASAP,neutral

Even when I was logged in and all the songs from any of presaved playlist were played, app showed no internet connection issue while I used to search.

If not solved ASAP, users might end up with other music streaming platforms. Which I already have been shifted to and have uninstalled the app",negative
Very bad app now a lot of ads and it get stops while playing songs but before the update it was really good and now it's no more good and i am gonna uninstall it,negative
"Whenever you hit pause for an extended period of time (5 minutes+) The list you are listening to resets & will keep replaying songs that have already passed in that session.

It's pretty good for listening to music but sometimes it can interfere with discord sounds. Spotify on phone is annoying because I can't choose the song I want on my liked list like I can with my discover weekly. Also why can't I shuffle my liked list on phone but I can't on my desktop. (Keep in mind I don't have premium.) The adds aren't an issue really. Spotify on phone and Spotify on desktop is two different experiences.,neutral

Good app but add fre is premium .,positive
Great selection of music to keep everyone entertained,positive
Too many ads,negative
"It's pretty good. But, after the new update, i actually become pretty confused. I can't play the songs i want, when i clicked the song, it's just a clip of the song. It keep playing shuffle, I don't know how to turn the shuffle off. Can you please fix this 🥺 ?? I've searched on YT how to solve this problem, but, currently, there's no tutorial for this. And they said the only solution is you should move to Spotify premium. It's not just me who's struggling with this problem 🙏🏻",positive
Hands down best music app,positive
Started to crash anytime I try to play a podcast,positive
Simply the best music app out there,positive
Spotify provides an immense range of accssessing music and podcasts casts.,positive
A premium Spotify member and I have issues with Spotify turning itself off or not playing whole songs and then starting up again. I don't feel like I should pay for something that does not work properly I've tried the tricks with logging out of everything and making sure the apps are closed instead of suspended. still doesn't work. Please addressed and resolved. thank you. If there was a app that gave me what spotify does without the problems and charged me more I'm would switch without a doubt,negative
Does the job minus the ads but it's bearable,positive
Great experience I have been using this app recently alot It's great But sometimes the song I play doesn't play alot of issues have occurred I would recommend u to download but you network quality should be good 😝😝,positive
Excellent stream of music,positive
"Can not play anything i have 2 accounts ive followed all help prompts, cant fix the issue cant see the play option persists that im set to offline when im not and my internet works perfectly on other apps. Im not paying an app i cant use het solutions for easily.",negative
3 stars cz i don't have money to buy premium 😁😂,neutral
My absolute favorite music app! I just wish it could be a little more organized when you search things up or like with the podcasts and shows. There are also way too many ads. I understand they need them for it to be free but dang.,positive
Still waiting for the day Spotify introduces Direct Message feature.,positive
I am having a great time with spotify. I have found songs long lost here. I love it!,positive
Good to hear from you and thanks for the songs and joy :),positive
Amazing app super sufficient i get all the music i wanna hear so time efficient too,positive
It is a nice app but if you haven't taken Spotify premium the add is going to suck your blood 🩸 litterly,positive
"spotify just randomly crashed on me today -_- pls maybe its just the day, its been weird since i woke up but this is annoying. lagging a lot, app keeps closing by itself and doesnt open, and it keeps freezing the screen and idk its just not working :< other than that its normally a decent music app, love that u can make playlists and they have a pretty wide variety of music so its all good when its working i guess :)",neutral
"Best & most Awesome App you can find. For international music there is no match for this app in India. Not just some songs-albums-lyrics since 1990s or 1980s, as a music afficianado you can get classics even till 1940s. There is even all recorded songs of Little Walter from 1920s, the 1st+only solo artist to be inducted into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for Harmonica. Incredible range & quality. Also Lyrics for 90% of Songs. Top auto-playlist-recommends. Best free for few ads.",positive
Spotify has the potential of being the best music app ever but they only want money and you add ads between almost ever 3-4 songs?? Not to mention u cant take off shuffle or listen to individual songs on mobile but can only do it on TV or laptop which is ridiculous.,neutral
Horrible app you make a playlist and spotify decides to add in the worst songs imaginable you cant get rid of then you do it and it adds other gay songs hoorible app you cant even listen to one song by its self worst music app in the world you only get to skip a few of songs and then your band stupid app fix it for christ sakes,negative
Good application for lovers of music,positive
Spotify is my #1 favorite application for music,positive
Last update is so disappointing. You cannot play a single song without playing playlist. Shufft on playlist is pathetic,negative
Works horribly. And what about the 30 minute break before ads? That surely isn't the case here,negative
Need accurate song lyrics,neutral
"this used to be my favourite app - i'd use it every single day for way too long and rave about it. now spotify is just killing itself. the ui has gotten significantly worse, what with podcasts being continuously pushed in your face, and the extremely slow and buggy scrolling. i've been a premium listener for about two years, and my once astounding quality music has sounded dull, even with better headphones and many adjustments of the equalizer setting. that being said, i love this app",neutral
Easy way to find my music and podcast for a great price and best sound!,positive
Love it I can jam to one band of my choosing and any album of choice (the whole album) without any interuption!!!!!,positive
Love how Spotify always plays what I want to hear! And I love the lyrics section and the hand- picked Playlists!! Can't live without it!,positive
So far so good keep up the good job,positive
"When I got spotify first it was good till 2 weeks later it, it played diffrent music from the ones I wanted to play plus I can not choose a specific song and I have play it from the start and can only skip 6 times an hour and it limits what I what I was able to do.",negative
"Only annoyance is when I get in the car and turn on Bluetooth, a pop-up shows up right over the Car Mode button asking if I want to connect to speakers, even tho it's already connected to Bluetooth. This pop-up can not be swiped away, and I just have to wait it out to be able to switch to Car Mode.",positive
I'm happy that the app allows you to download podcasts but I wish you can download the whole pllist at once instead of putting each podcast one at a time which cause you to miss click without noticing. And since you can't custom your own playlist you would have to start all over with the downloads to get the right order. PLS FIX AND ADD THIS FEATURE!!!,neutral
Spotify music best song app,positive
This app is good with the custom mixes/playlists based off of music that you like and it also has a wide variety of songs but I really dislike the fact that this app has too many ads and that it celebrates pride month even though you're personality matters instead of your sexuality when producing music.,neutral
"It's great, really. Though I can't play any of the recommended songs I want to add into my playlist. It kinda sucks because once i add most of them into the playlist. They aren't even my ""thing"" or what I'm looking for.",neutral
"I love this application,its most used app on my phone..",neutral
"I don't really like the new update, I think it's unfair to only have 6 skips per hour cause it depends on the mood whether I wanna listen to it or skip it.",negative
Very nice quality of voice,positive
"Excellent and easy to use via streaming to my Marantz receiver,great sound and large catalogue.",positive
"It's been a long time for me to heard anykind of song from this app(spotify), especially for korean pop song. Then suddenly, after my latest update for the released new version this app having overflow lacks for it's sytem. As instance: when i still play onto my music, the song stopped out of the blue despite my provider is stable plus there's no disruption either,and other lack in some feature which likely to much for me to write it all here. For world's sake, please develop it beter odeveloper",neutral
"So I've been a spotify user for over a year but the app currently logged me out of my premium account that I can seem to get back, everything on my account is not accessible in the app but only in the web browser. Is there any way I can fix this promblem? It's frustrating me",positive
Hiding podcast removes it from home screen only for 90 days! That should be permanent,negative
"I CAN'T PLAY SOME SONGS, it always says, ""Something Went Wrong"" and i can't liked some songs. PLEASE fix this!.",negative
It's good . The only negative thing is the ads . The ads are mainly just their premium which removes ads but the only ad is the premium. It doesn't make sense,positive
Awesome experience using the app. I should have downloaded it a long time ago. The seamless play with no adverts is it for me,positive
"Im on paid subscription but i can't keep this shuffle button off, whenever i play, it will automatically turn on. I uninstalled the app, clear cache and log out on all devices but it is still on.",negative
"I Really Like What I Can Do, Like What I Mean Is I Can Make Playlist's & Not 1 Add Has Appeared. I Really Like This Thank you",positive
"Exceptional, stupendous,change nothing! You can improve on things if it's necessary as per me, i am satisfied. There's none like close to Spotify.The ability to play and replay music have put Spotify in a place where no other can attend or reach. In my world, all is Spotify 24/7 all year long. The opportunity to sing along declares Spotify the sole medium of music for me.I have the ability to learn the lyrics of my favorite songs and artists. All hell Bravissimo Spotify in my 🛖.",positive
App is great just the ads are too annoying,positive
I can't play the song that I wanted to hear it just shuffle into a different song that I never heard of,negative
"i absolutely love this app, but it won't let me subscribe to a premium plan. i am a student discount beneficiary and everytime i try to subscribe through mobile payment, it only shows me the ""oops, something went wrong message."" i have tried troubleshooting several times but there has been no solution. i have been stuck trying to figure out this problem for a few days now. please fix this, i have been a premium subscriber for a year and this is the first that has ever happened to me.",negative
Is the best music keep it up,positive
"its already been a yr n ur not even updating us, ive red the other reviews n we ALL have the SAME PROBLEMS! its not fair for us because we have to buy premium in order to unshuffle it? horrible service if u ask me. idc bout u updating the spotify, what we said needs to be done. not be ignored",negative
One n only requirement is option to download songs for free,negative
I love this app it has all kpop groups songs,positive
"How about instead of the ""We added"" part you just let me have my playlist JUST with what I added?",negative
App doesn't let me create a almost it constantly kicks me out to the app store and it freezes up when trying to select a channel doesn't play music app is trash after this update please fix or are u trying to force premium on us now will change when it goes back to normal loved the app before now,negative
One of the best apps I downloaded so far. I get great use out of it.,positive
"I love it! I can't go to sleep without listening to some podcasts or playlists, but there are some issues.First you can just skip 6 songs an hour and it's just annoying sitting there listening to songs you don't even like. Next whenever i try to go to spotify the play and back and forward button are gray and wont even let me touch them, it will also say nothing is playing. Please fix this and no it's not my device because i tried it on others and still dosen't work. Otherwise i really enjoy it.",positive
Excellent music suggestions,positive
"The app was really good until the latest update (06/23/22) , the layout is now confusing and everytime i switch to another tab the music is either choppy or cuts out. You need to pay for a bunch of things now which are very unnecessary. As a person that really enjoyed using spotify before this update i'd rather use youtube for my music, it seems like your getting a bunch of complaints from this update. I'd remove it before you loose spotify listeners too because im not paying for my music.",negative
"Genuinely disappointed wanted to listen to the good the bad and the ugly instead I got some other song and couldn't even select it because I'm a free user, what a scam",negative
For me I really enjoy it because I can access music that is not available on other music apps. They have a great selection of music and podcasts along with a great setup. The only thing that I don't like is that the fact that there is no offline mode. I enjoy listening to music on car trips but it makes it difficult to access anything because of it. That's the only thing about it that bothers me. Otherwise I highly recommend it!,positive
Being able to listen to most of my favorite bands albums is amazing and listening to it offline is even better,positive
Spotify is so annoying i wanna play my playlist/like musics but it goes to a different song like from suggested songs,negative
Great way to savor your favorite hits.,positive
This stupid app keeps turning itself off in the middle of listening to something and sometimes won't go to the next episode of a podcast.,negative
Always informs me when new albums or singles I might like drop,positive
"I hate this app now like seriously after the new update it's all changed like I can't even repeat the song and it's all in a playlist and it all pissed me off I deleted this app and I'm using another apps to listen songs cuz who would like to pay for songs, there are more apps🙄",negative

"This the worst music app ever. When you want to listen ""a"" song and they will give you a long playlist",negative
I can't get myself out from the house or car this music is the best thing I ever need to get my situation going on with the music you have it is such a variety of Great music so keep up with the good music you guys I love it !!!!!!!,positive
Too many ads after every other song,negative
this app is ok but adds sometime broke the perfect part but i love it tho,positive
"Normally love my premium but since the last update, if I have podcast and music on the same playlist. When the podcast ends, the music doesn't play like before. And that's very annoying it just closes the app. When I'm in a busy work day I'd like my playlist to play like it should. And not make me need to open the app again to select music. Please fix.",neutral
Please tell me how to stop the app from turning itself on as I'm driving!! nothing like music randomly blaring to cause an accident! Really opening yourself up to a lawsuit spotify.,negative
60 second ad every 3 minute song.,negative
Why do you add songs to my Playlist and I put them out but more come in please fix that if you could please do thank you,neutral
You should be able to make and sort a playist however you want.,negative
Spotify could you make it so that we can see our song and playlist just that playlist busily before you updated spotify piz??? It was good the way it was before you updated it.,neutral
Getting more glitchy. Integration with HEOS is horrible and unstable. Please fix!,negative
"I have a Premium Plan I use on a Samsung, but after the latest update I can't listen to anything at all. It tells me I don't have internet when I do. It tells me all the playlists are empty. If I look up a song, it won't play it. I have deleted the app, restarted my phone and reinstalled. I have cleared the cache and data and then done all of those steps. I have done the ""clean reinstall"" steps. The only time I can get the app to function is if my SD card is not in my phone. Not a solution.",negative
Worst never download this one U can try resso and wynk and other all but compared to all this is worst . It u didn't take premium membership 24×7 adds i am getting 1min add after one song I request u try resso is better,negative
I put five stars but if I have any issues then I wont hesitate to come back and GLADLY set it at 4 again 😳😇,positive
Easy to access,positive
Great selection of music and the ability to quickly create your own playlist that can be public or private.,positive
"I avail a premium last 3 months, which i really enjoyed and didnt think that the subscription will be today, i didnt get ANY NOTIFICATIONS, that my spoti is ending, and it stole like $3 on my acc, not much but when u equate it to ph money, its like, 149. Which I've been saving so I could buy more important things, wish you would notify us next time. This is really frustrating lol",negative
I loved this app but I updated it and it took away my shuffle button won't let me pick out what song to play won't let me restart a song and you are no longer allowed to skip songs more than 6 times per hour and from some of the reviews other people are experiencing the same things I would like for this to be fixed please,negative

The app is not letting me play any song or open any of my playlist ...after the recent update ... please fix it soon🤌,negative
Can't get certain songs but overall this app is great,positive
"This is one of the best app for leastining the song. In this app the haryanvi and Punjabi song lyrics are not in Hindi, its lyrics are in haryanvi and Punjabi. But the other app like resso any language song lyrics are available in Hindi, and this is the main drawback (demerit) of this app for music lovers. Thank you ❣️",positive
Works amazing and I'm finding songs I haven't heard in a long time,positive
My go-to streaming app. It's Spotify: what else is there to say?,positive
"Used to love spotify until everytime I try to play my playlists, it plays other songs and I turned off autoplay and it still doesn't work. Spotify is only doing this for money",negative
"Another broken update? None of the song radios work. Playlists I listened to yesterday now say deleted... All of them. Spotify works great and does exactly what I want 90% of the time... But if it doesn't work the first time, every time, it's not good enough. Don't push broken updates. Edit: you lost another star for breaking your app with bad updates. You've altered your algorithm and all the ""song radio"" are playing things things that are not the same genre and songs I've never heard of.",negative
I gave this a low rating only because when I downloaded the app NOW it started screwing with my phone to the point where I had to delete it. The app never did it a year ago it just started and it is still the same phone,negative
Very good mood settings..satisfied and approved!,positive

"(26/06/21) App used to be really good but now since the updates. it keeps telling me I have no internet connection, and wont let me search my downloaded songs. Plus payments have gone up and barely get any use out of the app.. as it won't let you use it offline even though you've paid the fee..hopefully this will be resolved soon. And it is still the same(26/06/22) if not worse I am wanting to cancel my memebership and use another service because of this rubbish",negative

The app used to work very smoothly before but now the app don't work at all . I am not able to play any music . It was an ugly experience for me . Plss fix this quickly .,negative
Music keeps stopping. Very frustrating,negative
Works great and tons of selection.,positive
Too much advertise,negative
"It's a good app though but too much ads it's very distracting or frustrating you can't even skip an ad and have basic features but only exist in premium like downloading offline, listen to all songs simultaneously (I.G., every song is shuffle), moving the timestamp etc.",negative
I really enjoy the company of spotify . Thank you so much,positive
Forces phone to restart when i open the app and download feature non- functional. I bought the premium mainly for the download for offline play feature but cant even download 1 song. Overall so slow and laggy,negative
Spotify have everything that you could possibly want to listen to.,positive

Every time the youtube TV add plays it repeats 3 times it's annoying,neutral
Ok it's good it has all my fav songs but there sould be an option to play a playlist in order or to just listen to a single song with out it going to a completely different song that is why I'm giving it a 3,neutral
This is an exceptional music streaming service. The pros of going premium far outweighs the cons. I'm going to enjoy it very much but please bring back the anime tab on the discover page,positive
Awesome content with even obscure bands available.,positive

So amusing to hear music from your site without hustle of too much ad.,positive
I love this app! I pick everything from Patsy Cline to Jefferson Airplane and end up with hip hop!! Spotify all day long! Thank you for your app!,positive
Almost all the basic features of a music player--as basic as selecting a specific song to listen to--are premium only. The desktop version is fine but the mobile version is useless because of this.,negative
I use the app literally daily. I have just one problem when I upload the playlist photo it will stay there until I close the playlist. Once I open it again the photo won't be there. Please let me know if there is a way to fix this. Other then that I love the app.,positive
My favorite music always.,positive
Best Music App!,positive
"Android app is trash. Like many other people, the app does not work with wifi. I have to disconnect from wifi everytime I want to use the app (and remember to reconnect to wifi when I'm finished using the app). Inconvenient and disappointing - especially coming from a multibillion dollar company.",negative
"App constantly crashes. Personally, I have a hard time navigating. The list of recently played songs should be easier to access from your queue. My queue constantly clears when I accidentally click a song (when I may just want to go to the album or add it to my queue) but then when I try to start a new playlist, it will go back to a queue I had from days ago. Also very annoying that podcasts and music are all together, so it's hard to go back to your queue after listening to a podcast.",negative
I have had Spotify for years and I love it. It is user friendly! I listen to podcasts on my way to work in the mornings and music at night. Best app ever!,positive
When I lock my phone the music stop until I pick up my phone again and open it how do I get rid of this feature 😒,negative

Been able to listen to music that I haven't heard for years thank you Spotify,positive
Reduse some ads,positive
Cannot play an album without the app giving suggested songs.,negative
Love this ap. Better than pandora by far.,positive
30 min. No adds or interruptions is a LIE ! And why playing songs not on my playlist . If you were honest I would get premium.,negative
"I love Spotify as a whole - it has everything i look for in a music app. But constant issues with the functionality are very annoying. It stops playing and crashes all the time, the progress bar randomly stops displaying the accurate place in songs and podcasts, and sometimes doesn't connect to my Bluetooth speaker. I don't have any of those problems on the desktop app. Edit: 6/25/2022 and still having the same issues. No attempts to fix them whatsoever.",negative
Great App wishyou could loop the song you want without premium.,positive
"It's great I'm not gonna lie I can pretty much enjoy listening to it while ny phones off. I gave it a 1 star because of the fact that I need premium for loop on,listen to the songs in order from my playlist,and tap in the song of what I specifically wanted. But the ad isn't exactly the problem on why I gave it 1 star due to it being common for me to encounter some. But point being this sucks without the premium and that I rather go back on YouTube then this.",negative
"I can't play a song whatever way I want. I can't play one song at once and unless I get premium, I can't replay a song unless I play all the other songs on a playlist. It limits too much things.",negative
I am really enjoy spotify app,positive
It is a banger to listen to music I know some say why can't u listen to any song u choose on your playlist but they have to make money after all,positive
I love this app and trust me the premium is definitely worth it,positive
"Was good now it just doesn't work! Was fine last week then 3 days ago can't access anything on the app. Says no internet connection which is a lie as it's working for anything else. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, logging off and on, restarting phone and still not working. Grrr am going on a long road trip and want to be able to play the Playlist I want. Can't even play recommend Playlist! Might have to cancel subscription!",negative
Good music 🎶 easy to find what you want to hear,positive
This app has become an abomination and is completely unusable now. Spent hours trying to figure it out.,negative

Great app! just wish i didnt have to buy Spotify premium to listen to music for free :(,positive
Great selections & playlists!,positive
Don't like it cause you need to pay money to just listen what you wanna hear and I'm not gonna be having 60 different songs to just listen what I want to hear,negative
Loved this app in the beginning. I could choose where I wanted my playlist to start off at... Now that you have updated the app I can no longer do that... On my tablet I have the older version of Spotify where I can pick the song that I want to start with... I just wish it was back to the way it was before this update that they had.... Still love the app though.,positive
Everything I need; my educational podcasts and favorite music,positive
Internet connection often gets lost when i have full connectivity on other apps. Songs often fail to play. The home screen rarely updates. It takes ages to load albums that i have downloaded and saved locally. I pay $15 a month for all this disappointment along with a very comprehensive music library which is still rad when it chooses to work.,negative
It's the best app in the store. Couldn't live without it.,positive
I don't have ads on Spotify I got premium and I've had premium for years and I will never ever go to any other streaming service for music it is the best streaming service you can find anything on there hands down the best music app ever.,positive
This is dumb it won't let you do anything unless you have permuim and it adds songs to my playlist that I don't want and I can't even click the song that I do want to hear and it's agrivating and annoying I can't play songs on loop unless I get premium I honestly think this app is only for people who can actually afford to listen to the music which is unfair,negative
This is an awesome app its so easy to use.Ive been using this app for a while now but there IS one problem...when u create a Playlist they add random songs and play it which sometimes just ruins the vibe,positive
So many freaking ads 😠😠😠,negative
4 stars because there's always room for improvement,positive

Great music until I only got six skips per hour. What is up with that?,negative
Worst this app only 3 or 4 songs skip Advestament,negative
Useless app. I had a free account for 3 months and never used it a single time. Just use youtube.,negative

Love it accept commercials,positive
"I have to say that I'm impressed! Put in my prefered artists, and the app made playlists that are exactly what I like! I've listened to over 20 hours of music, and skipped less than 10 songs. Well done! Well worth the price. Wish more apps worked this well...",positive
The latest update makes the app crashes everytime I open it. Needs to be relaunched everytime… :/,negative
Love the intuitive play lists.,positive

thank you a lot...for the music,positive
Great music library. I hope there was some option to change theme in the future.,positive
exceptional app.. the new version is amazing!,positive
Good finds most artists from most decade's,positive
"The app was amazing when I could scroll through my Playlist. But after the update I can't. You can shuffle it and stuff but you can't scroll though and pick your music, that's why I downloaded in the first place because I could scroll through and pick the song I wanted and it would play from there. I don't know if this is a me problem but it's really irritating me and I might have to switch apps. Please fix this as soon as you can.",negative
"They added the feature to hide undesired episodes from your home screen on the cellphone, which was really good. But the feature isn't on Playstation Devices. Those frustrating ""recommended"" episodes still appear on my home screen!!! I've tried turning on Restricted Mode and hiding them from my cellphone but they're still on my home screen when I log in to the app from my PS4. It's so frustrating!!! I didn't even listen to podcasts and they recommended me 18+ stuff that I definitely don't want!",negative
Just don't like it when the song stops and starts,positive
Ad to music ratio is abysmal. Literally open the app and it plays the same 2 ads back to back okay thats cool then plays 2 songs and then I gotta listen to 6 ads? You're ads manager (whatever their actual worthless title is) should be locked in a room only listening to the ads. You're literally driving people insane till they purchase premium. Very scummy.,negative
"constant ads. not only that but my mixes no longer give me the option to choose which song i want, now it's presented as regular playlists. how the hell is it supposed to know my music taste if i can't even choose what i listen to?",negative

I downloaded spotify to try it on my phone and its not lettting me play any songs its absolute garbage,negative
It's cool. Best selection of music I've seen of all the services I've used.,positive
It's getting harder and harder to hear the songs I want without resorting to paying for premium. I'm currently looking at other streaming options because I'm so fed up with shuffle play.,negative
It's just perfect... the best app ever!,positive
I personally use this app for podcasts and it's really easy to use. For music however this company doesn't seem to fairly pay artists on the platform and you can't play a specific song you want. You'd have to play a playlist and in creating a playlist spotify will sometimes mix in other songs that it decides are similar enough to other songs in your playlist. Just overall frustrating unless you're using it for podcasts exclusively like me.,negative
This app is amazing I love it so much and definitely recommend it,positive

I can't log intoon it with my Facebook account in the APP,negative
What's up with the volume being too low on android auto? It's way too low.,negative

Just awesome they have every song that I wanna listen too,positive
This app is very helpful to play all legand singer songs. Thanku spotify .♥,positive
We really are enjoying Spotify.,positive
"Unreliable updates and changes. Please add useful features like pausing my randomized playlist, switching to another playlist and then jumping back into my randomized playlist without restarting the randomizer. Please remove one touch song playing. Very frustrating to scroll through a big list, accidentally touch a song and lose my spot in my playlist.",neutral
Everything I want to listen has been great,positive
I took a 3 month trial subscription but I can't seem to be able to use the app at all.. I have gone back to my older app for music after trying to run the app million times. My only concern now is that it says it will charge me after my trial ends and I can't find how to end my subscription. Very unresponsive team haven't had any reply from them on my last review..,negative
Love it! Best Music app to have.,positive
The greatest place other than home (spinning vinyl) to play and hear music.,positive
Very very ads I request all my friends please 🙏🙏 bring down the rating of this app. Because it contains lot of ads.,negative
Cancelling my subscription. Going back to peace and quiet.,negative

"Spotify working very bad connected via Bluetooth in the car! I have Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus. Bluetooth version - 5.0, A2DP.... the music constantly breaks, stops and begins. Is there a solution to this problem?",negative
This app is my fav but there are many issues to fix in means like in YouTube there is dawload video so when no network but fun.But there is no options for this or else this app is nice.,positive
The best music streaming service I've seen. And I've used most of 'em.,positive
"Downloaded it , first few months 1 comercial for every 2 songs now I get 4 comercials per song. They Amp up comercials like crazy. Many of the comercials are for liberal companies like Facebook asking for more power to silence people and companies looking to diversify so no white people need apply to those I guess.",negative
Annoying amount of ads Ads pop up every 2 songs Rest assured spotify is a great app,negative
Spotify is now becoming very worse it is playing adds for every two songs all time distance and also less sound for songs,negative
Excellent songs to change the moods,positive
Great selection of tunes.,positive
Very nice app 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 works very nicely 👌👌 less data consuping and I recommend everyone to download the app,positive
"Everything is really good. easy to use, good design, big community and song collection. Hope for better sound quality. And maybe some social features, could really raise the time spent on app. More widgets please.",positive
Outstanding service to me! My playlist will blow your mind OMG! 💜💜❤💜💜💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💣💣💣💣,positive
I changed my long time five star review to one star because Spotify on Samsung is terrible. The update causes it stop working constantly. This review is from a premium user. Maybe it was five star before because I had an iPhone and spotify didn't constantly stop working. Now I have to force stop it in my phone settings anytime I want it to work properly. Whoever made this update really messed up. I hope you guys take these 1 star reviews in consideration because spotify used to be good.,negative
"The app is awesome you also can listen k-pop songs here, you can choose your favorite artist don't think download it 🌟🌟🤩",positive
"In general I like the app, but if it let's you create your own play lists then it should allow you play it in the order you arranged not shuffled. Lower rating after I noticed that the majority of time I'm getting ads after every song.",negative
Spotify speeches are better than other sites That's why I like it,positive
"Good selection of music, but the app is basically unusable without premium. Without premium, you can only play full albums and playlists, you can't fast forward or rewind songs, you can only skip five songs in per hour, and you can't go back songs on playlists or albums. The worst part is that all of these premium features are free when using Spotify on PC and Mac.",negative
Like the app but it won't let me play songs if I'm at the gym unless it's connected to a WiFi modem,neutral
"In the last update, I'm being with issues, in offline mode, if I'm without internet, the app doesn't let me see the download list, and if I'm already on the list doesn't let me play the music, but I'm still liking the app... But a little disappointed 😔",positive
Love listening to Charlie Musselwhite and other harmonica players.,positive
Love being able to listen to the songs I love!,positive
Not just music. Unbelievable podcast selection.,positive
"I accidently unlike a song from my liked playlist more times than i care to admit and it seems like such a trivial thing since you can just like it back right? Well yes you can but not the way i thought, it does come back but as a new song so that means straight to the top and after a while it got irritating because i got used to their old placement. My only note would be to fix this or add a feature that lets me put it back exactly where it was, it can even ask where it should go. I dont mind",positive
It is the best music app I used,positive
"New update sucks, I listen to mostly podcasts and it pauses randomly and does not display the rewind, fastforward,, and pause option anywhere I've seen. When I put my earbuds away it use to stop the audio but now it just starts play from my phone.",negative
"There's such variety and available music that you can enjoy tremendous amounts of diversity, I love that. Old and new artists, it's wonderful. Music to relax, music to work out with, music to inspire, music to motivate! Spotify is fantastic! I like that I can share with my Husband too. I also like that wherever I utilize Spotify my playlists remain as I make them, cool...really happy with Spotify!",positive
Love how every artist I listen to is on it,positive
I love Spotify been a customer for years premium is worth it.,neutral
I've been on Spotify for 5 years. I've always loved it but now I play music for an hour and it stops playing. I either have to wait a half an hour for it to kick back in or it just doesn't kick back in and I have to change what I'm listening to. What is the problem please let me know! It's exasperating!,negative
Great music selection and so easy to use,positive
"Try to listen to amalee latest album. Rise of the monarch, but everytime I try and I get a play list of random songs. Some amalee but most form random different artists. After 15 attempts I still only heard 3 of 10 song out of the album.",negative
Constantly opens the media controls in quick setting whenever I connect any BT device. This shouldn't even autostart let alone start playing,negative
"App is not great. Service is great. Hoping the app developers start to help the user more..or will return to Apple, much better App. Details: App crashes a lot. I have premium, but when offline App won't open my downloaded music. It seems the latest update removed the pause, forward, back buttons. Overall App would get 1 star, but the overall service is worth 3.",neutral
Soo many irritating ads after every song it becomes soo damn irritating. Amazon music is much better !,negative
Audio quality is top class. But sometimes it literally feels like I'm listening to ads in between songs!,negative

I cannot open it, and I have to uninstall and reinstall it. This has happened a couple of times. Very frustrating.",negative
Nice Ad app u got der.😵‍💫😵‍💫,negative
Keeps pausing my song and wont play it all the way through. I've updated the app and I've uninstalled and redownloaded the app and still have the issue. 😠,negative
Its so hard to just get one song on! And 6 skips per hour? No. This update has made it so hard to function anything! I would rate it lower if it was even possible!,negative
Sucks when trying to play music in another device google asisten and play the same in my cellphone,neutral
"This is the second time....after I paid for premium membership, it's still not upgraded. It's been weeks now after I paid for the premium. How long do I need to wait?",negative
"I tried out Spotify years ago when I got a free trial of premium from Pandora, and I have never used any other music app since. I absolutely love the ""Made for you"" section that curates songs based on what you listen to. I've found so many new songs and artists I absolutely love and I wouldn't have found them without Spotify. Just get the premium, it's 10000% worth it.",positive
Good app only downside really is the ads but I've come to accept it,positive
Worst app ever just go and download SoundCloud instead of this app its the worst app i have ever seen it has like a billions of ads in it and its just a weird wastes all of your time on ads rather then listening to music🎤🎼🎹🎶,negative

Good app ..good music..,positive
"Great music, better price. It's free😁",positive
"I feel very happy, Spotify playlist is ever before ever after",positive
"Unacceptable for a paid service that is this old to have this many bugs. The now playing bar, which controls everything, has been MIA for months. Music just randomly stops playing. The buttons to pause and play just randomly stop working. The only remediation is to force stop and clear the cache. Trying to get support from Spotify is an exercise in madness. Their forums are an absolute mess and their support teams understand the application less than a casual user.",negative
"It's great I haven't tried any other music podcasts apps,",positive
I lesson to Spotify because it let's me pick the greatest song that it has or been looking for in years.i enjoy it very much thanks alot Spotify.,positive

I've had Spotify for years. Best platform for saved music and custom playlist. My fav part as a fan of sound quality. I set mine on extremely high quality for great sound especially if you play loud,positive
"Spotify started off excellent, but the problem I had with App has now spread to the desktop. I can no longer play a selected song, there is no longer that icon next to the song. Was considering the premium but this problem has caused me to change my mind. And yes I have restart computer and reinstall App. Happy for those who have no issue . Hope you guys could get this fix.",negative
I love just having music that I like. I can find music even if I don't know the name of the song or the artist. I can choose my playlists according to my moods. I love that I can follow small artists as well.,positive
Use it on a daily basis and to be honest don't think after using it I could live without it ..music is my thing and what I use it for mostly obviously but gotta whack a few podcasts on now and again like true crime or dr.nosleep or the jack pod but best thing iv ever downloaded and won't ever have a phone without it again unless for some reason they stop the app ... Now for a 2 hour drive .. Alexa play Spotify :),positive

I enjoy it. It is the best music app ever.😊😊,positive
"Why do you keep bringing up songs that I don't even listen to and doing it when I'm Not even listening to any music anywhere?? None of the other music apps that I've tried do this!! I was trying your app because I was thinking about buying it, but after this BS I don't think so!!!",negative
"Fantastic app for listening to music and podcasts. My only complaint is that my downloaded podcasts don't show up offline. It may be because I don't have Premium, but the company SAYS I should be able to download and play them offline for free. Not that I'm ever offline. People who rate this app one star for the amount of ads are ridiculous. Yes, sometimes there is a 3:1 ad-song ratio, but ads are hardly ever longer than 30 seconds. Your songs are much longer than the ads you get",positive
Very smooth...and recommendations are really making my playlist amazing everyday.,positive
Spotify it is a very good app *****,positive
Wonderful but offline music also requested,positive
I love it app so nice songs 🥰🥰🥰,positive
"It's not bad but not really good because it only has 6 skips an hour which is very low and you can only play song on shuffle. If I could play songs in any order I want,had more skips,it played song in my playlist not ones that aren't and it didn't have ads after 3 or 4 song,then the rating would be higher but until then it stays as a 2.",negative
Excellent music allways and more.,positive
"Won't show the song that's playing, or let me fast forward/rewind",negative
"It's very good but... I hate the fact that I can only shuffle! Like, I can't choose the song I can listen to anymore. (Unless that's a premium thing.) Also, the music downloads don't even work for offline!",neutral
When I go to search option it shows internet connection not available I restarted it but it was the same . Need improvements.,positive
I'm paying for an app that keeps crashing every 5 minutes! Rubbish,negative
I'm on 3 months of free premium so I can't complain. And my sound taste senses have been broadened.,positive
i can and will literally sit there for hours blasting my music through my headphones lol,positive
Great music app it gives you all the best tracks!!😁👌🏽,positive
Nice very useful during travelling Music always helps us to rewind our memories🥰,positive
"Awesome!! Thank you to the creators of Spotify!! I fu ki' love it!!! You guys have introduced me to the most wicked singles and subsequent albums. Truly, emphatically, I'm virtually certain I will never require another music platform. (Perhaps the integration of artist videos would be appreciated by many of your 'loyal subjects'). Again, Dear Spotify constitutents, THANK YOU!!!!!!!",positive
Just what the doctor ordered. Relaxing and soothing music.,positive
"Ive always been a Spotify user but right now I am pretty sick of how it always presumes I want to listen to a playlist on shuffle!! I can start playing from the top of my playlist but it will randomly then switch to shuffle after a few songs or even just completely change what I am listening or play 'songs I'll like based on...'. Tbh its incredibly frustrating and when I then try to play the next song I wanted to listen to, Spotify pretty much crashes and I have to reopen the app!!!",negative
Pathetic customer care service was waiting for 2 hrs while 6 different agents came and didn't even solve my problem.,negative
Simply the best music app have ever come across with good sound system and one thing is can do something else on the phone while playing music unlike other apps🙄 which will stop playing. Awesome!,positive
"Ads are annoying but it's a great free service for music fans ,Can purchase ad free at a price",positive
App is not even launching on S22 after the latest update.,negative
One of the weakest app I have used in my life after every song there is advertisement like come on the guy who invented this app and the way he is running the advertisement on it is a very stupid brain grow up its 2022,negative
"My username pops up as my account code. My library is non existent, and nothing plays. After days of on and off trying to fix it, it still doesn't do what it used to do - what it's supposed to do. I shouldn't have had to put forth the effort for what is clearly a programming failure. I think that I can safely say that based on my experience, and many of the most recent reviews.",negative
"The preview of songs is gone when I go to add more songs, it's a way that I can find songs that fits my preference",negative
"There is not a good scrobling app. At least with Spotify I get what I ask for. I used to like my music from the ""box chick"" but her developers broke the scrobling algorithm. That said, the ad free version is worth the money.",positive
Great choices of music!!!,positive
Very bad I can't download songs even if I have premium plan,negative
"It has no feature to stop it from taking over radio in your car. it is morning and your car is in Bluetooth mode. It starts playing music when you don't want anything to be playing. When you are listening to a news brief, and it ends. Spotify takes over, all want to to is think about what you just heard.",negative
It's really good and all but songs sometimes get deleted and that's pretty annoying,positive
"It's literally impossible to listen to the song you are searching for , very bad user experience.",negative
Really bad phone app and even worse on PC/Windows. I stopped paying Spotify's ridiculously inflated premium prices and just use YT Music now...which also sucks but at least it isn't Spotify. Good riddance,negative
Good but sometimes wheni use my shots xpro I can't hear the music..,positive
"Absolute terrible update. When shuffle play is on i cannot go back to listening the song i played. And i can't even turn off shuffle play because it requires premium. Such a bad app i used past over the months. And when i go to a playlist, i cannot even play the songs. Worst update.",negative
I can't play a specific song that I want. A different song starts everytime.,negative

My app updated and now every album Auto shuffles and I hate it. Give the option to turn off shuffle,negative
I Love the App I rate it 4 Stars Because the songs Stop when I Watch A Video,positive
Good app but quite laggy when moving the audio time.,positive
"The easiest music player I have ever used....original and cleaned music and songs are there...You can create playlist as your preference and list manually....especially in laptop web version and for tablets, it's fully free but cannot download music....there are ads available but which is not much annoying...So, newcomers why are you still waiting here...just tap the install button & explore the unlimited music universe...",positive

One of the best application for music . Love it ♥️,positive

The song quality is so amazing. I have been using this app 2 years. It has million songs to listen. Not a words to say about this. 😎,positive
"- Stop getting rid of songs that are playable!!!! - I have downloaded songs and they keep saying 'unplayable' the next day - what's the point in all of this?? One of the ridiculous things of this app. - If a singer, band, or album is 'explicit' can you not just verify listeners that they are over 16 or 18 to listen???? Absolutely a joke 😡😡 - Also, why does the app always crash ubexpectedly?",neutral
I personally use Spotify as my first choice music player and it's good but sometimes it doesn't show to album cover for albums that I have downloaded even with a working internet connection.,neutral

"This is being critical. Spotify only cares about business work and profit, it was good until a year then lately nowadays am facing lot of disturbing circumstances through Spotify, it keeps playing songs out of my playlist even tho the automatic play button is off from the settings and I've seen ample of comments about the same problem being faced by people whosharing their experiences in Google and it is not getting resolved until I take their premium membership such things were not expected",neutral
"Finally Spotify has matured into a decent app worth paying for. A few issues remain: (1) no indicator on playlist screen to show if sequential play or shuffle play is active. Imho there should be two separate buttons, ie a standard play button and a shuffle button with suitable colour change when active. (2) should have an ""AI"" button to play more songs like this based on past listening history. (3) Need ""hey Spotify"" voice commands, especially when driving. Keep up the innovation 👍",positive
"Absolutely horrible, cant even choose a song to play. Works worse than ever before and honestly literally anything else is better, even audio jungle and you hear it screaming at you half the time but it's still better than back to back ads and to fix all of the horribly stupid problems that are only on mobile mind you, you have to buy premium. Genuinely scummy and has likely resulted to lots of people abandoning a once semi-decent app. Absolutely deplorable and saddening.",negative
Very good app. But always log me out when I'm traveling abroad,neutral
"Been using this app for many years now, cannot find many things wrong with it, it's extremely affordable for what you get and very easy to navigate and use as a whole. Highly recommended if you're looking for a consistent music app you're happy to pay for. (Just needs to suggest a wider range of recommended songs and shuffle a bit better in playlists)",positive

"The new update sucks, the only way I can listen to music is in a playlist, you can't pick what time you want the song to be anymore, you have to shuffle in order to actually listen to a song, more ads, and it fills up your playlist with useless songs, worst update ever!",negative

Spotify is broken I can't play the song u wanted,negative

"It's quite annoying sometimes because you can only skip 6 songs at a time and I can't find the song that I want . I have made my own playlist which has like 12 songs, after 5 or 6 songs it changes my playlist. It's unfair only 6 skips an hour having to wait as well as that I can't play a song I want from my playlist but I have to shuffle play. But apart from that, the quality of the songs are good.",neutral

"Some issues with playing some songs here and there but overall, a great app. I've discovered so much good music to my taste in this app and I've been using it for almost 2 years now. It has helped me through so much bad times. The podcasts are also to my liking. I especially like ""Teenager Therapy"", they talk about feelings and things others are confused about. They simply explain it. Thank you so much Spotify.",positive
since the update whenever I play a song it always randomly stops,negative
My experience with spotify so far has been very good 👍,positive
"Enjoying the daily mixes, sending so much unheard music my way",positive
Best music application ever,positive
Too much ads. Wrost app,negative
"Honestly I'm just disappointed. I uninstalled the app a couple of days ago in order to fix the app which worked but when i logged in my account all my saved songs and playlists are all gone. What they hell!? I had over 1,749 liked songs in which i can't put them back into my playlists because it will take ages to add them back again. I thought it would save all my songs and stuff but Honestly Im just disappointed on how a account can just lose all it's stuff by just logging out.",negative
"Wasn't sure I'd like Spotify, right away discovered a good selection. The Playlist are easy to make, in no time, had 3 made. One for work, one for chilling, an one for let's f-n Rock. My favorite",positive
It was about to connect the music to the living rooms TV when I didn't even ask or idk how it got there.,positive
"Unusable, with the constant crashes. I only came back because there's sometimes more music here then other services. It's still garbage, I really don't want to support it, since they don't care about their user base, they have questionable morals.",negative
Super app in music,positive
Straight away it's telling me no internet...what is it with this App. Every other App is fine just for Spotify I suddenly don't have intetnet....what a load of RUBBISH reading all the NEGATIVE reviews says to me that they DON'T CARE SO GLAD I DIDN'T PAY FOR IT UNINSTALLED AGAIN. Staying 1 star plus I'm not going to pay for premium when IT DOESN'T WORK FFS FIX IT,negative
It is very good music app,positive
Very good app to listen to music with all facilities and user friendly interface,positive

Uninstalling it.. Has become the worst music app recently bcz of irritating ads keeps coming after 1 or 2 songs..sometimes the ads duration would be more than 2 minutes combined of 2 or 3 ads in between songs.. #Spotify,negative
It helps a lot it doesnt give you adds that much and you can turn your screen off and listen to music at the same time unlike YouTube or any other rip off app spotify is the best app ever and I recommend it😁👍,positive
the app on my phone doesn't work anymore after the recent update. it says my playlists are empty and i can't play any music or podcasts at all. it works fine on my laptop though. i pay premium and i can't use the app anymore.... coooooool fun i love it >:C fix it asap,negative
I try to listen to a song but it puts a different one,neutral
Worst app very slow loading 😡😡,negative
Great app honestly but sometimes when you choose a particular song it plays a completely different song and that's quite annoying but otherwise it's great and highly reccomend,positive
Premium is how you get everything you want like only Premium users get to choose a song from a playlist and skipping only 6 six songs a hour when you do Spotify you expect easy and smooth ride but nope only premium users have that make free accounts have either choose a song from a playlist or allow more skips,neutral
Please stop with the full screen Duo ads for premium. I'm not your target audience. Don't make me switch to YouTube Music :(,neutral
What is wrong with Spotify? I play a playlist and songs which aren't included in the playlist start playing. I don't want to listen to those songs. Why does Spotify ruin the mood. The playlist and blends don work fine. 1 star.,negative
"So, unfortunately after their most recent update, it seems I and a few others can no longer use Spotify. I haven't been able to listen to Spotify for a good week and a half now. Every time I try to listen to my playlist, it'll just endlessly load. It's really a shame because Spotify has been my go to music app for a while now. I've tried all the recommendations to fix this, and nothing has worked. I downloaded YT Music and I'm remaking my playlist there. I may come back if the issue gets fixed.",negative
Needs to have a night mode or incognito mode because my sleep music messes up my wrap at the end of the year.,positive
"Any blue tooth device when commected will cause spotify to automatically open and play the most recent song you played last. No way to prevent the auto play. Needs to a addressed in the next update or you will loose subscribers. Upon doing research this is a known problem since 2015. Not sure why developers haven't fix this major issue. Only ""fix"" is to log out and log back in every time.",negative
"This is best platform for listening music . But it is glitching in many devices , including mine too in which it was crashing as we play any song . Mine got fixed now but in many of the devices , this glitch is still there and hence i give 4 stars. Developers should look after this issue or else many of people will shift to other platforms like yt music , prime music , gaana etc",positive
This is a very good app but there is so much ads of premium Spotify,positive
"I personally love this app! The UI is good and the app itself look kinda cute. The music quality is really good. The best part is that it gives my daily mood mixes and weekly mixes too which is very accurate to the kinds of songs I listen. The discover features isn't for discovering random songs but of genres/styles you prefer. The reason to give 4 star is because of too many annoying ads. You can at least remove ads in certain playlists like ""meditation"" or ""study"" Overall it's pretty good!",positive
1 star because developers refuse to fix the bluetooth autoplay feature. If the app is closed NOTHING should play... EVER! It doesn't matter If it is connected to Bluetooth or not. Amazon Music doesn't do this. Pandora doesn't do this. Only Spotify doest this. Why is that? Are your developers graduates of community college? Or maybe not graduates at all?,negative
I have no words it's the best app every but sometimes it's will opt work but is super app,positive
I ❤️ this app. I get to listen to different singer songs !,positive
It's great...just be nice if you had more skips and could play any particular songs on Playlist as you wanted without having the premium subscription.,positive
Great for discovering new artists and listening to the old ones that you know,positive
Worst appl🤮🤮 I get ads after one song Please stop this app. It will be way better,negative
"I love this app! I just start my tablet, start the app, select a playlist and enjoy great music for hours without having to do anything else. I don't know if there's any Greek music on here, as sometime is what I feel like listening to, but if I find some, I'll come back and add a sixth star in my comment. Edit: They do have Greek music, I found a long time ago, but I forgot I had made this commitment. They also have podcasts about anything, which I love!",positive
Suddenly I can no longer use Spotify properly on the phone idk how but they suddenly ruined a good thing.,negative
Good app but i cant play the songs i want to it plays random songs i never even knew about in my playlist when i choose any song it plays random songs like that.,negative
Love that I can make my own personal play list!!,positive
"It's kinda weird on when I was trying to listen to a long Playlist it was like ""YoU fOUnd A pReMeIUM FeatUre"" and didn't tell me what the freaking feature was. And when I clicked it again it just said it again with not even playing it. I'm going back to YouTube.",negative
It's been awhile i have use this and i love this... But i gave it four star.... For some kind of issue ⚠️,positive
I LOVE THIS APP YOU GET TO LISTEN WHATEVER YOU WANT so that why I give 5 star,positive
My entire library just got wiped and i can't actually play anything right now. Upset :(,negative
Recent update has ruined this app. Good UI and app was great before. Now music constantly stops and app crashes or doesn't load.,positive
The best application to listen to music,positive
High quality music for all age groups and tastes.,positive
Its the best app for listening songs I really like the different album for different moods and from different countries,positive
If you listen to music this app for you lol,positive
"I updated the app and there is SO many ads, like 2-7 ads after every 1-3 songs, and the 30 minute free ads do NOT give a full 30 minutes, I've started to use YouTube because it surprisingly gives LESS ads then Spotify now?? I mean I can't use it in the background on my phone, but on my computer I can, so I use YouTube when I can. Also the feature where you can listen to samples of the songs when adding them to playlists is gone, WHY???",negative
"Great music, can send stream to Echos, computer, TV, phone, etc",positive
I love this app I listen to all my music on it but it's so annoying when the app keeps putting songs on my playlist,neutral
Quit changing to the damn radio every time I touch a song. If that is what I wanted then I would do that,negative
Fun but hella ads,positive
Best app but.. Wish I could dowload the music and hear it offline.. But alas everyone greedy :) thee non a problem,negative
This app is trash it gets paused in the middle and some music advertisement comes and doesnt stop and you cannot even play the song you want to play,negative
I only listen to my favorite murder for entertainment and white noise for sleeping. They are both 👍,positive
Almost everything is now a premium feature you can hardly do anything but I still like listening to music with the app,neutral
It sometimes lags my phone severely. Sometimes it just straight up refuses to play the next song in my playlist until I open my phone and tell it to keep going.,neutral
"1 star because you can not just drop advertisement after every single song 😂😂😂 are we streaming song or Spotify making us watch advertisement... According to me, Spotify should pay us for watching these advertisement 😂😂",negative
The shuffle play update for free user is useless now I can't play the song I want to play,negative
I have enjoyed using spotify.it is fun creating liked play lists.,positive
I hate how they add songs to playlist you make I would give it five stars if the remote that feature,negative
"It's a very nice music app, really I enjoyed😊",positive
Great app love it I can listen to songs with my phone off but Spotify adds songs to my playlist which is so annoying,neutral
"Day 1 Pandora user that made the switch late 2021 because of the presence, artist count, album count, etc. 2 stars is generous IMO due to the not-so-seamless integration from GalaxyWatch4 and ZFold3 hardware. Additionally, what makes me really want to drop this to 1-star is the same YouTube TV ad playing 4 times consecutively. Sure I could become a premium user, but I use Spotify for 4 hours a month at best. I won't be moving back to Pandora simply because I'm satisfied ""enough"". Is that enough?",negative
Love this music app !,positive
This app sucks it won't turn off shuffle,negative
"This is good, but can we get a ""friends activity"" in mobile version, please, make it realtime.",negative
"the app itself is kinda buggy sometimes, but good quality overall",positive
I'm not using Spotify anymore cause they removed all the lyrics,negative
Making your free version crappier isn't going to encourage me to give you money. It's going to encourage me to delete your worthless app.,negative
This app SUCKS. When I try to play my music it never does it worse music app,negative
Playlists are too repetitive and YouTube music is way better,negative
Horrible. App has been broken the whole month. I want my money back for this month. Totally unusable. Edit: still garbage. Haven't changed any settings and it just keeps pausing out of nowhere.,negative
Great Music App.,positive
So many ads and I've had Spotify since before the pandemic it's just gotten worse most of the time also plays the songs you skip ever other day,negative

Lots of advertisements coming past few week. Very disappointing,negative
Nice but too many ads...,negative
I am listening all day long as I do my yard work and great fishing buddy. I'm never board,positive
Best on demand music app,positive
"This app has being recommended by alot but whenever I try to create an account it's always abortive, either using email,facebook whichever way it just never works out. I just hope it's my phone and not your app package",negative
"This app is absolutely amazing with the premium service. My only real complaint is that in the liked songs Playlist you can only select one genre to listen to at a time, it would be great to be able to isolate multiple genres to listen to in you liked songs.",positive
"i cant play songs seprate anymore. it comes up as a playlist, and that's extreamly annoying. you cannot skip more then 6 songs per hour without premium. the only thing i really like about this app is you can play things with the screen off and stuff.",negative
"I am a happy user of spotify. Less ads even when I am using the free account. Plus, I get to stream songs from BTS members. I also love playlists and podcasts and the additional short vid playback for some of the songs. The app is easy to use and very practical too ☺️☺️",positive
"I'll give this a 2 stars for now, I agree with the low rated reviews. I LOVE listening music on Spotify but the problem is it's too restricted! It literally wants u to buy premium,I tried everything but nothing work! I wanted to listen 1 song ONLY but it keeps recommending me other songs that I don't wanna listen to. And I also hate that you can only skip 6 times for an hour!? Fix this problem and hoping there some improvements:/ Y'all really want mobile user's to pay money for some useless prem",negative
All good but adds are more,positive
The worst music app. You can't listen to what you want without so many annoying ads that are not even in the language you have your phone configured. Soundcloud is a billion times better,negative
"Good app, but it's been quite annoying lately sometimes when I'm playing a game while listening to any music it randomly stops and I have to go back in to fix it, Why does it even do that? It's annoying..",positive
"This is literally the most useless app ever It doesnt let me listen to my music, i can't even listen to anything i want and the ads just straight up lie to you. If i could rate negative stars, i would",negative
"You sit on a throne of lies. All those ""listen to this ad and get 30 minutes of ad free listening"" is bs. I get an ad either, between 1 or 2 songs",neutral
I can't even listen to the songs I love and only the songs I love anymore without a whole bunch of other songs come on instead it's so aggravating and you can't even skips as many songs as you want idc abt the ads but the other parts of this new Spotify app just ruined the whole app now I can't even listen to music that I want to pls go back a update.,negative
Spotify plays almost everything I can remember and that's enough,positive
I do like spotify alot.. but i really dont like that i cant delete recently played list. i should have the freedom to do so if im paying for it..will be thinking of canceling account and payment.. Thanks,negative
"I'm paying for this app and it's still so sucky??? Always glitching, can't see the music play bar on the app nor on my homescreen/lockscreen. No matter how many times i refresh it, update it and clear up my phone. Why am i even paying for an app that doesn't work efficiently.",negative

Great app very cool easy to use and has every song would use 100%,positive

Ads are annoying.,negative
Enjoy listening to this daily. Now I need to store fewer mp3 tracks on my pc and phone. Love how versatile it is,positive
"It keeps playing misuc I didn't add on my playlist and won't play anything that's actually in my playlist. I can't even choose what song I want to listen to, it's like someone asking what you want but gives you something completely different anyways",negative
Stop buying podcasts and making them Spotify-exclusive. The ecosystem is decentralized and independent for a reason.,negative
Super music selection,positive
Not got an issue really got everything im looking for only down side would be the price for multiple accounts,positive
Has almost every song I search and it's a very good app,positive
Lot's of advertisement.......... One song one advertisement 🥴🥲,neutral
Loving being introduced to music I might not have heard otherwise.,positive
Sound cloud is best free also all fetures are free which are paid in it,negative
Haven't worked it ourt yet but sure is OK.,neutral
"I love the app, it's just now I can't choose the music I want to listen to on a playlist or my liked songs, it just chooses randomly, I had it in a specificus order I liked to listen to it, and now it just chooses random, and when I go to press on the so g I want, it won't let me and it just plays a little part and it won't play the entire song, and it is really annoying. I can still listen to music, but it just chooses and it's kinda annoying I just wanna listen to my music in order not random",neutral
The best music choices....there is no comparison.,positive
Been using this app for years now n premium has YET to fail me. Use this app daily and it never fails me. Thank you guys for such an awsome useful app,positive
"Even thought some there are some out there song I can get, such a great App to lookup any genre I need and listen all day to.",positive
I hate spotify with all my heart. I can't tell you how many times I have wasted an hour of my life trying to listen to one song and listen to ad after ad as I'm diverted to a song I didn't ask for. God please strike these lieing bastard down. My time is precious and I don't appreciate it being stolen.,negative
"This is a okay app,it is probably the same as YouTube music or anything else. It's still nice and shows you all of you're favorite songs",neutral
It's good but I hate how you can't listen to one singular song and the only option is shuffle and they add to your Playlist and I hate that I only want to listen to the songs that I want and you can't do anything but listen this app is bs and you need premium to do everything,negative
"If I want to unsubscribe from premium... Why do I have to open my account in web browser? App must have that functionality, that saves time and effort, improves customer experience in a few words...",neutral
Literally horrible I don't understand why I'm trying to listen to music and ur sitting here playing ad after ad just after one song. And it would be the same ad get a grip,negative
"Way too many ads i literally once got 11 ads in a row. It's honestly ridiculous, if you dont get premium you have to sit through 2-4 ads after every 3 songs its annoying and makes the whole experience suck. I get really overestimated sometimes and I have to play music to calm down but the ads really make it so much worse, especially if the person speaking in the ad makes mouth noises. There should be a way to at least flag certain ads so you don't have to listen to them.",negative
Because it kept on changing the music in my playlist it won't even play the music I chose to listen to instead plays some random other song I don't even like,negative
No longer works on my phone!!!!,negative
It has been very nice using Spotify till I can afford a steady subscription,positive
What happened to this company used to be good I guess now it's owned facebook I just found out today that for me to watch Hulu on a big screen. I have to pay extra membership now so that is that so it's all good. I tried to call customer service for Spotify and they don't even have a phone number anymore. What's going on? Everything by owned by Facebook is like just you cannot contact them anymore. What's going? What's going on with this company?,negative
Easy to use I love Spotify,positive

Not happy about ads but generally very happy 😊,positive
Great music library with useful features. Phone app isn't as great for organizing playlists as its PC counterpart though.,positive
The Android app has a lot of issues with the queue for me - deleting and rearranging things. It's very frustrating but also the developers have been very helpful and responsive (albeit so far unsuccessful) trying to solve this. I wish Spotify as a company did more to limit the spread of false information and paid artists more fairly. Overall it is still the best music streaming service I've tried.,neutral
It doesn't allow me to add more diverse music. It only allow some music to be available. Not very much to download.,neutral
It good there also ksi music is good as well,positive
Awesome music app easy to use recommned it to everyone,positive

"Will not stop, stopping while I'm trying to listen to music and playing a game with no sound on.",negative
"So far, so good! Listening to music that I like with no problems at all.",positive

"With this app, I can listen to music without interruption",positive
My recently listened to section had disappeared and plus half of my homepage is ads for podcasts that I couldn't care less about even though I've never listened to a podcast on Spotify before. This app keeps getting worse with each new update.,negative
"Apparently I'm not the only one with this issue but when I go to another app it will stop playing music, even though I pay for premium. Or it won't show what's being played when I'm in the app. Please fix this it's been doing this since the update and it's really annoying I'm considering changing services. IM GETTING SO TIRED OF HAVING TO CLICK PLAY BECAUSE IT KEEPS PAUSING ITS SELF WHEN YALL GONNA FIX THIS",negative
"I re-downloaded the app because I liked it better than any other music app, but every Playlist is empty and none of the podcasts work. I have premium and I checked, all of the other apps on my phone work and I have a strong data connection so I don't understand what is wrong. I'd really hate to delete my account again.",negative
Music is awesome!! Joe Rogan podcast is the only reason I downloaded this app because you sponsor him and he is my dad,positive
"You don't need any other music app , this app does it all",positive
"Idk what are people on. Awesome app as always. Just pay 5 bucks or just stay quiet. Five bucks is nothing and by paying it, every door opens up. And no, there are no adds on Spotify Premium. Never was.",positive
good app but the ads are to long,neutral
"The worst piece of software I've ever used from the more mainstream ones. Doesn't work properly on desktop, doesn't work properly on Android. Just pathetic.",negative
Love the music! Just getting started in Spotify.,positive
Recently updated version forcing me to remove this file from my phone. Thanks Spotify Bye Bye,negative
Good but many ads,neutral
You guys need to fix this app. The version that goes on the phone works fine but the version that goes on my TV SUCKS I've never been able to watch a whole episode of anything on it you have to log out and go back to the TV main menu and go back into the app at least once every 45 minutes.,neutral
For some reason I can't listen to the music that I downloaded for some reason,negative
"I HATE the new update I can't listen to the music I want in my playlist I like the song but I just don't feel like listening to it right now, and then I skip and skip so I can get to the song I want the new update is annoying and absolutely useless I hope they fix this.",neutral
I was listening to one musician and the app started playing other music and I couldn't change it or pass. Not impressed.,negative
"Had to go back to Spotify Free because Premium was a luxury I can't afford. Being poor is punishment enough without being taunted by awful features of this app. One album I love I haven't heard in entirety for weeks, as if some songs just aren't available. It shuffles in other artists, and plays songs already set to hidden, then the playlist stops before actual completion and I'm expected to start over with songs I've already listened to? Borderline fascism. Spotify are bullies.",negative
A great music service.,positive
"When you dont have premium you get limited skips, you cant put a song on loop, you cant pick a song, and its only on shuffle. I use music to work on writing, art and other things, but with the fact that I cant pick my music without premium I find it difficult to actually focuse because I cant pick the song I need to suit the mood I have. And with having three to four ads in a row it messes with my anxiety. And with the new update, my music stops mid song. Spotify is just getting worse.",negative
"-Sometimes when I switch device phone, computer or TV when I change song I can't played it and it jump to another song or app just freeze then crash. Sometimes for no reason I just got disconnected anf need to log in when I do I have message no Internet connexion so can't log in I have to clean cache for the app, uninstall and install it and log in again. Sometimes all my playlist are gone temporarily and all download playlist offline were gone so I have to downloades it again.",positive
It was working fine but now nothing is working I can't play anything,negative
I can't download over wifi unless I select to allow download over data.,negative
Have been more than a satisfied customer now for over 8 years. Thanks Spotify,positive
"I use to like spotify until this new update, whatever this new update is it stoped me from picking the song i wanted to listen to because spitify ruined my playlist. It now shows a preview of the song i want to listen to and they removed the queue for songs. The only way i can use my playlist now is if i connect to my console or tv.",negative
It's amazing I like the music and the videos,positive
Tbh this app is insanely overated because whenever I try to play something it plays something else completely different and I cannot change it and without the premium subscription you can only skip 6 musics per hour 😐,negative
Best music streaming out there,positive

I haven't had a better experience with streaming apps than Spotify!,positive
It could be much better. Will randomly stop playing. Occasionally still recieve ads although I pay for premium. I'm not even mad just disappointed at the wasted potential. Get it together spotify.,negative

I used to love this app for finding music for my videos or just to listen to for free but now when I click on a song it plays a whole different song and plays LITERALLY ALL SONGS for half the song then goes to the next song :/ I hate this app I can probably find a better app for music and music for my videos I'm never installing this app again and I DONT suggest this app,negative
"Harder to use each update. uses a ton of data, but wont work correctly in offline mode. Good luck listening to podcasts. Not user friendly any more, used to be great. Randomly shuffles. Have had premium for about 6 years now, starting to rethink, not worth 9.99 a month. If you only listen to music on shuffle on WIFI, this is the app for you.",negative
Best music app around.,positive
Stops after about 30 seconds everytime I want to play somthing in the background,neutral
Sending ads every few seconds,negative

"New review- I would give less than one star because it was already on 1. The update I made today is now not allowing the app to play songs in a consecutive order if there is no shuffle on. Also when I want to play a song it instead plays something entirely different that's not even in my playlist! The app keeps stopping, it just pauses the sound and I can't make it start again unless I force close the app and open it again. Rubbish",negative
Very good aap whichever I hope to play my favorite song this aap fulfill my desire Thank you very much spotify,positive
This is a great app for streaming music but sadly I don't have premium yet,positive
"Easy to use, song quality excellent",positive
Nice can play my fav songs,positive
Samsung S21 Ultra. South Africa. Shuffle keeps turning on.,positive
It was great until I had to play an entire Playlist to play ONE SONG!,negative
"Disappointing. I turned offline mode on as usual when I purchase a premium, at first it allows me to play my downloaded songs but now I can't even play any song and the offline button is gone. I can't turned it back off, better fix this problems or you will lose all of your users.",negative
I really love Spotify it's ossum My heart too Spotify 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜,positive
best app for listening songs,positive
TOOOOOOOOO MUCH ADS.,negative
"Glitchy and unacceptable. My Spotify has always been glitchy, closes at random, skips multiple songs, switched out of the playlist to a random one however now it's beyond bad. The play bar disappears constantly for days on end. This means I can't skip, pause add songs to playlist, pause podcasts, ect. I think this is absolutely unacceptable for a paid app. Yes I've force stopped the app, deleted and re download it.",negative
Easy to navigate,positive
App is generally good but occasionally slow and buggy. I also have troubles occasionally with controlling songs playing and playlists when casting to an external device.,positive
Ads are annoying,neutral
Too many ads on podcasts with Spotify premium.,neutral
I Love This App Because I find All Songs.. I wish you continued success💝,positive
"It's OK. Has a lot of underground bands I like. App crashes frequently, often will hang on loading my downloads page before erroring out saying there's no internet (I download podcasts/music BECAUSE I don't want to use data) Also likes to change songs from what I was listening to to a completely different song when I get into my car",neutral
"I'm using this aap last one year and I have good experience with this aap. I used to like that the ads were not much, an ad used to come in 20 30 minutes. That's why, I used to recommend my friends to download this application. But for a few months, ads come twice every 10 15 minutes. Now I don't like it. I think that the ads should be reduced a bit, it is necessary to take some attention to spotify.",neutral
"When ever you are serious and wanna listen sad song then the add comes, 1 song = 4 adds.",negative
Let me listen to my own damn songs not some suggested songs.,negative
Better than other music apps I have tried,positive
Terrible app that magically works if you pay for premium.,negative
"Spotify is nice and I have my favorite playlists on there. However, the ads can get unbearable and I used to be able to pick my songs without premium. And now I can't anymore, please Spotify don't make that just a premium thing. I can deal with ads but I hate having to listen to a song because I only have 6 skips. I like being able to pick the songs I'm in the mood for.",neutral
"It used to be amazing but now nothing ever loads whenever I click on my likes, artist, Playlist, etc. I thought it was my phone but its still happening.",neutral
"i love this app, but its not good without premium bc with premium you can skip unlimited songs but without you only can skip 6 per hour 5$ is not much if you wanna have no adds and unlimited skips😁",positive
Brilliant. All my music in 1 place all the time with me... what more do you want....,positive
Best app for songs....,positive
"Garbage. Spotify sucks at playing music. Several years paying for this app and it still has no idea what music I enjoy. If I ask my Google home to play a specific song off of spotify, it won't do it most of the time. Unacceptable for a paid service.",negative
I have issues while using on android music randomly stops and evertime it asks me to allow background play there's not option for it so I'm constantly having to turn my phone on to keep the music playing,neutral
There so ad and makes me anger cause whenever my mood to listen song but whenever ad start play its very annoying after ad i really not want open Spotify plz we don't need any ads it's so annoying,neutral

"plays music, has good algorithms",positive
"Best music app that i know of, but sometimes it gives me short clips thst are shorter than preview clips on my samsung(s). Or Prehaps, there is a setting that i overlooked.. Spotify is the fiurst music app that i've emgareed, Kind of easy to move around. Keep it up!!!",positive
After every song there are two ads and you know that I am not listening to songs I am listening to ads what they say,positive
"I have recharged for 7 days premium, but I can't able to connect and listen with other premium members,Repeatedly showing only eligible for premium members.",negative
No ads and all kinds of content,positive

Best Music App Ever..,positive
Best platform for Best old songs I like it.,positive
"It worked well all this time, but recently the just app crashes.",negative
"Would be better if my freaking notification area wasn't always bugged. Seriously sick of it. That and I don't get half my podcasts showing a lot of the time until I reset the app 100 times, noticed it's the Daily Wire pods especially. Yep, and again today, was listening to a podcast that's mysteriously disappeared again of course it's a conservative one. Will be canceling if this keeps up",neutral
"The control you have over your music is crazy, and for the low low price of free 99",positive
I can't see lyrics of any of the song,positive
I give it 4.5 stars It should let u rewind song and pick what u want to hear by choice . Not follow the order,positive
"If you hear music while gaming,this is the best choice for you",positive
The fact that those in premium can't download music to their hard drive is a bit unfair. Also at this point spotify should have dolby capability,positive
Good app for hearing music but we cant bosst volume in spotify....... It was there but updating the options in the playback removed please add that option again ....,neutral
Songs and lyrics are available at all times. Listening to music by all songs available in shuffle mode.,positive
i opened a discover taylor swift thing and now it broke the app. i'm reinstalling but if it's broken you're gonna get a real angry phone call soon!,negative
"Need to fix the stupid app, it's so annoying to have to listen to 3 ads then only get to listen to 2 songs before u get more ads",negative
Wow can't even turn off the shuffle mode I just wanna listen to my favourite songs and I need to pay for it?,negative
I really enjoy the product. So healthy and encouraging.,positive
Refusing to recognize play lists. Now using browser version until fixed 😒,negative
Love this app until I can't play the songs I want anymore it's on shuffle and it adds songs to my Playlist. I guess I'm back looking for an app I can listen to what I want when I want! I'm so Uninstalling this app I'm so disappointed!,neutral
It's a nice app with background play and it's easy to make playlists and all..but I'd recommend it that you add the clear history option back and make it so that you know which song is gonna play next. It's a good app overall,positive
"Probably the best music streaming app available at the moment. Interface is dated, though. This is where Apple Music triumphs Spotify.",positive
Surprisingly glitchy with user irritations that exist for an app that's been in existence for so long. A better alternative would be a welcomed change.,neutral
Best collection of music!!!,positive
It's better to listen on spotify rather downloading song,positive
Sorry to say but it gives too much adds.. the more good is the music and the more is the no. Of adds . Btw I love it!! Just fix the no. Of adds...!!!,negative
Just love using this app this is awesome 🔥,positive

Really great way to enjoy music,positive
Great and enjoyable music.,positive
"Its astounding how everytime i load up this app, something is wrong with it. Just now I tried favoriting a new album to my library, it says it saved, but it's not there when i try to open it. I try playing any kind of music? It gives me an ad that says its 10 seconds long and then gets stuck on that ad for 2 minutes!! Of dead air!! This is why i dont ever want to try premium either.",negative
Sucks. Plays 5 seconds on my android and stops.,negative
"I have loved Spotify since I got it, the premium version is incredible and pretty cheep. Algorithm is pretty good most of the time, but when it isn't pretty good it is absolutely terrible, that's the only thing that brings this down! Great app for music lovers",positive
"itself, the application is good for listening to music, but it does not play the song you requested, they play the artist but another one of their hits and the one you want to hear they don't play. you make your playlist and right away they add about 50 more songs because according to them it's your style and you're going to like it! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️",negative
"Spotify has every song I have ever looked for, including Shazam songs from television shows I watch. The playlists they create for me have gotten me through the brightest and darkest days in my life for over a year. Music heals and Spotify has a song for everything. Thank you.",positive
I wanted to listen to ONE SONG. Just a SINGLE song. App won't let me. Every time I click on the song it plays literally anything else. Can't find the song out anywhere else yet or I'd go anywhere else to listen to it.,negative
I enjoy the music between all the ads I get. Great app for listening to ads and breaking it up with a song every now and then. Oh did that new album just drop? Here's a bunch of unrelated songs and the album is out of order.,negative
I try abd try to play my liked song but it let me like there giving me songs that i don't want to lisen to that are not eveb on my liked and i press the shuffel liked song so it can play at least one of my liked song but ut stikl dosn't play my liked and if i try cliking on the song it jest gives me a prevu i liked the old spotify betty this us jest not if overall it sucks,negative

Great music app. Easy to use,positive
this app is getting worse. now it won't keep my liked songs downloaded so I have to go on data constantly to listen to my music at work. I've been paying for premium for years to not have to deal with things like this and it's so frustrating,negative
Cannot get to stop playing in the background. Canceling and uninstalling,negative
It won't let me play my music only there stupid suggested songs that I don't ever like FIX THIS,negative
"Glitchy as hell. I install this to listen to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast and Glitched like crazy, crashed on me and when I went back to the episode I was listening to it just started back from the beginning even though I was already halfway through. Uninstalled immediately after that, too bad.",negative
"To quote an ad from Spotify itself, ""easy to use, highly colaborative, works on any device.."" Love ittt!!!!!",positive
"My Episodes Folder makes this app useless offline. Every podcast I download is added to My Episode Folder, it happens automatically and it's much harder to remove than how it's added and undownloading an episode doesn't remove it. When offline I to go to downloaded podcasts in my library, but that just brings me to the My Episodes Folder, which won't load because there are undownloaded episodes in it. I can not access my downloaded episodes offline, so why have the app and pay for premium?",negative
"This is the worst app for podcasting, awful at downloading, awful at offline listening. Awful for podcasts. Always sucks at downloading, never stays where I left off. The offline mode sucks. Skipping through ads starts the episode back over. Wish Rogan never made a deal with you guys. Never have an issue with Google podcasts Update 2022, still the worst podcast app I have to use. Wouldn't use it if it wasn't for Rogan",negative
They have EVERY thing and I mean EVERY thing! LITERALLY EVERY thing! And I'm still discovering and re-discovering EVERY thing!!!!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼,positive
I get what I want when I want it. Outstanding!,positive
"I've used this app for 10 years. To say that I cannot live without Spotify is an understatement. It's so cheap as well to listen to unlimited music and podcasts. If you a willing to invest a small amount on a monthly basis, I guarentee you won't regret your experience with Spotify.",positive
Nice but spotify can you keep edit the playlist option. If you need to add song by our own sequence. Please it is an request to spotify. Otherwise this app is very nice and I like the ready-made playlist.,positive
I love to be give 4 coz Spotify is using simple but when advertising Start I hate the app most,positive
"The only thing I don't like is there is no way to replay as song you like, you can skip songs but you cannot go back to one of you want to share it or get three title and artist. Everything else here is work it, even on the free aspect.",positive
Offline mode doesn't work and when my phone turns off and back on I can't go on spotify at all and I have to delete ALL of my downloads every god damn time even though this is premium... Jesus just fix your app.,negative
why nowadays i'm not able to search song..When i click one song automatically another song gets play.,neutral
Great music with no ads,positive
Spotify is a amazing app for music and podcasts and I really like how it has all songs like pop rock all sorts of music.,positive
Worst worst app i hate this app a lot of ads making me irritating and not at all giving pleasant music with this stupid ads and subscription is highly cost and i feel so bad about it 😡😡😡😡,negative
Good but there should be less ads but good,positive
Just enjoy the music and appreciate the free plays,positive
Very inconsistent connections too many commercials.,negative
"I like it but, it missing the ""song"" feature.",positive
"Simple to use, happy I added this happy!",positive
"Overall it is a great app for podcasts with copious amounts of content but problematic on my Chromebook. I have problems several times a day where it stops showing me what is playing in the left side panel, preventing me from interacting with the podcast in any way. The only way I can fix it is to go into settings and completely delete the app's storage then log back in. This of course wipes out anything I have downloaded. Unfortunate but prevents me from using the app as much as I would like.",neutral
"Awesome I like this music app I really enjoy music in very high quality but some movies missing like rakshak, itihaas, mrityudaata, tere mere sapne, diljale etc",positive
"The reason a fee paying customer does not recieve ""lyrics"" when they're actually paying good money for the favility, is because hhe failt is at Spotify. Customer's shouldn't need to uninstall and reinstall and fanny around with their phones and trying all other manner of fixes. The fault is at Spotify not on thousands of people's phones like the stupid fixes posted on YouTube and a thousand other places suggest.",negative
"Had a 160 hour playlist before I got a free trial of premium, wasn't able to afford to pay for premium, so my playlist got cut down to 32 hours and I'm not a happy camper.",negative
The enhanced feature on playlists singlehandedly makes spotify the hands-down only music app choice,positive
Amazing the best song app ever,positive
It is a very great app for listening music and you can create playlists select different artists that you like and listen to their playlists or you can search the song and listen to it,positive
Best Apps for songs lovers..,positive
Spotify is the best music app in the world,positive
Excellent for recommendations! Has exposed me to many different bands that I didn't even know existed :),positive
I love listening to Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias but the only have it in Spanish no matter what you select. It sucks.,negative
"Good app, but it is glitchy in the car and doesn't start playing automatically and randomly stops after a song. Also for no reason it stops you from liking songs. To fix it you have delete it and reinstall it. This has happened since I got it and it should be fixed.",positive
"Garbage. I just want to listen to the song that I want to listen to. Why is that so difficult? And I shouldn't have to watch a 60 second ad for it either. Then it gives me random songs from the same artist. I skip 6 times and it's locked. Screw it, I'll use YouTube.",negative
"I love your music platform, It brings an amazing experience and excitement to life. Thank you sincerely Mr.Wilson",positive
everytime I restart my phone the cover of my playlist change and it always crashes.,negative
Updated: had to update to one star after I get an ad after every song! Old review: The app works greatbut no way to skip the ads especially when they are all unrelated and untargeted. Why the hell would I care about mental health and all that jazz for snowflakes? They just spam you to death with unrelated stuff. I never got one targeted ad in my years of use...,negative
"The last couple of months it has been very glitchy. Every single time I open the app, it says it has updated exactly 49 songs and the app will then stop and cannot download this mysterious last, 50th song. I have to restart my phone. Absolutely painful. Also music playing but no currently playing displaying on the screen, have to go into the app each time. Randomly shuts itself down too. The share function hasn't been working either. Unacceptable for premium subscription. Sort yourselves out",negative
"Very nice app , but too much ads",positive
I'm from Louisiana and Spotify has everything I love all Louisiana hip hop,positive
Easy and versatile,positive
"Very bad developer's , after opening app network error is common 😑",negative
"I love this app I can hear to bts songs🎧🎵, hurray! And this is jst awesome for all, but especially for armys 💜💜💜🥰❤",positive
Terrible if you commute on an underground subway. The UI and your library of downloaded and locally stored music cannot be played unless you manually switch the app into offline mode. The app should gracefully handle periodic outage of wifi/wireless connectivity and still function. Will likely be cancelling my subscription for this reason as Spotify is how I listen to music on my commute.,negative
"I love the app and its function works smoothly for which they deserve 5 stars but I can't access Spotify podcast in Pakistan, therfore, I am giving 3 stars.",neutral
Too many advertisements,neutral
"I'm especially thrilled that I can run other applications simultaneously with Spotify on my phone. Minimise, listen to music and carry on with everything else!",positive
The only problem is that I can't download it or play music without data.But I love it ❤️💖💖💖💖💖,positive
"For music, it is the best app but for podcast google podcast is the best for me. You should learn from them.",positive
Experience is absolutely great best music app ever,positive
"In my liked songs it doesn't allow me to play a song I wish to so I have to play it on shuffle and to add to that it only allows me to skip 6 times in an hr, doesn't let me add songs to queue or even see what song is next. This is all after the newest update which is honesty horrible because I do not wish to pay premium for features that should be available for everyone. Honestly speaking majority of music apps don't have such a thing and it's disappointing on Spotifys side to even think of this",negative
"Frequently pauses and plays again for no reason about every minute, until it finally stops playing. Just started happening in the last week. Makes listening very frustrating. Glitchiest app I have every used.",negative
Excellent music app one of the best,positive
"GREAT I love this app, old and new music. I can access via my phone, car and TV. I live for music so it is great. I pay a reasonable monthy fee to remove ads. The only bug bear is I download music for the car, and they sometimes it says I need to re download for no apparent reason which means if I am out and about I can't do. Also great for playlists and suggesting similar liked music.",positive
"This app was all good. I enjoyed listening to my favourite music, but all of the sudden when i try play any song it takes me to a complete different song. I cant ever play the songs i enjoy listening to because of this. If there is any way of fixing this, please get it fixed because i miss listening to my favourite songs without going onto YouTube because spotify wont let me play my songs.",negative
Love all my playlist that Spotify creates for me!,positive
Love app but hate lossing all my songs when i cant aford premium should just lock em or not let u get more not make u start over had 3000+ songs in library an alot of it was new people names idk so cant find alot. So pay or kinda sucks an make youtube easyer its free to have a library an never erased or this would be 5* app,neutral
"Changed my 1 star to 5. Not even going to explain why, but just use Spotify as best music streaming service available.",positive
"The app is old garbage. Offline mode deletes daily playlist, daily freezes, you can't share a song without the app breaking once. It's just bad. Spotify is outdated as an app an same goes for the desktop application. Edit: I got my like playlist with 1500 songs. Spotify plays 20 of these if I press random. Still broken.",negative
"Why are Singles and ep's shown as albums under Your Library Also, it would be nice if we could see liked song in albums, like it is with playlists",positive
I don't have much to say Just that it's everything i wanted from the app,positive
Best songs app ever. Except the ads....,positive
"Really awful experience. Keeps shuffling songs and forcing me to listen to random things. I search up one song and click on it, and it plays other songs. I tried going back in the playlist, and that's not possible for some reason. This app is surprisingly bad.",negative
"Just joined up, so far so good, just trying to work my way around it, atm",positive
"Most of the songs from any genre are available. Like it. And, easy to use.",positive
"Best free music app, simply put",positive
It works just fine but I don't like how there's no search on home screen 😠💗,positive
Good selection but has a recent tendency to be glitchy.,positive

SO PLS CLEAR THIS MATTER, CUZ I THINK MOST OF ARMYS INCLUDING ME WANT THOSE SONGS.. AND CAN U PLSS PUT KOREAN-ENGLISH AND KOREAN TRANSATION PLSSS",positive

Love Spotify so much I have premium and it works so well keep up the new content,positive
"Just about every song you could want is here. Easy to use, and I really like that Spotify alerts me when my favorite artists have new music.",positive
The app is absolutely amazing and it's a 10/10 for me.,positive
If you don't have Spotify premium then the adsssss are like more than the songs in play list basically it's a paid app only.,negative
"Edit: Since they brought back car mode I've raised my rating to 4 stars but there's still some weird bugs like being unable to access my playlists but music still plays and everything on the home page is fine. Old: So, let me get this straight, you removed the perfectly fine car mode - which despite the name actually had plenty of uses outside of a car - and replaced it with a mode that can only be used with the ""car thing"" - which is currently only available in the USA and costs a cool $80???",positive
Thanks Spotify keep it up best app,positive
What the hack Spotify?! Why I can only invite family member to my account living on the same address!? Why the hell I would need so many devices on one address?! What a stupid decision to change the policy,negative
This app is so bad don't download. If u play your favriout song it will start an anthoer song. Don't download,negative
GIVE THE OPTION TO DISABLE THE VOLUME SYNC WITH SPOTIFY CONNECT FOR CHRIST SAKE!!! I have multiple Connect devices and I don't want them locked together at the same volume. THIS IS A BIG ISSUE THAT IS AN EASY FIX FOR YOU!! Listen to your (paying) users because a quick Google search shows this is a common issue. 5 stars if this petty issue is fixed.,negative
it takes too long to download an album and I'm using a good wifi please fix this then it's goan be a deff 5 star and can u make the download animation like that of apple at least.,negative
"Great music, very clear. No b.s.",positive
"Crashes constantly, very often plays the sound but doesn't show the player screen, so you can't pause or skip. Often while just listening the whole app just crashes. Integration with Alexa used to be great, now it's hopeless. 9 times out of 10 it doesn't do what you want it to.",negative
It is a very excellent app it has a option make your own album I like this option very much. it has all kind songs and lyrics. yeah it's a good thing excellent but sometimes it's logout itself please do something about it that's why I am rating it 4 star,positive

Nice app for song lovers I personally love this app,positive
Great sound great selection,positive
"Spotify tells that it gives 30 mins of ad free music but it gives ad after every 6-7 mins. And now it contains sexual content too. Idk what are sexual audios doing in a music ap. It's disturbing when such cheap content pops up on the screen while searching for my fav songs. Your ads are very irritating I swear. I know they are made to sound irritating, I swear the voices get to my nerves so much.",neutral
Its autoplay is off yet playing as autoplay.,negative
"Usually great but recently the app has been bugging quite badly - I'll pause the music to do something outside of the app, and when I go back the control bar has vanished so I can't play, skip etc. Still have the bar in notifs but that stops syncing with what's playing so barely useful and even closing all, reopening the app & picking new song doesn't fix it, just now I don't even have notifs bar to control it. Really ruins the usability.",neutral

"Love the service, using the app when i actually want to works flawlessly. but the app has 1 big issue for me. It tries to open spotify and play my local audio files when i open them outside the app. and is making it impossible to play them with the app installed.

Not used to the interface yet.,neutral
Excellent this app for music is so good I love spotify,positive
"I hate the fact I can't put the song I want as a free user, I just want this one specific song to listen to first in my liked but I only get to hear a couple seconds of it, I have a bunch of liked songs so it's hard to get to the one I want in my liked. Also the 6 skips only and having to wait for more skips is annoying as a free user",negative
I chose my music and found it good,positive
"This app is good after all but sometimes it doesn't play the song that I wanted to listen to, and also I hate the skip song limit (6 skips per hour) and I want it to be removed because it's annoying and frustrating. I'll rate 5 stars if you fix those issues.",negative
Video podcasts are still unplayable.,negative
In advertisement there is option for downloading song. But in that app it is missing,positive

"Love this app. Its helping me to listen different category of songs with different genres with lyrics. Like whenever a song hit my mind then i used to open this app. In gym, walking, traveling, study time, lonely and sleep time this would be helpful to enjoy music. Thank you Spotify.",positive
Best music streaming app,positive
I will never use premium. Show me adds as much you can.,positive
This is dissapointing. Cant listen for 1 minute without a damn add,negative
Good platform. I love it,positive
"Its getting worst day by day literally just after 3 or 4 songs a dozen of ads pop up, u cant even skip them.....just have to make your ears bleed for straight 5 minutes....uselesss app",negative
Too much aids.... And some old songs are not found,negative
This app will force you in every way to buy its premium and after 3-4 songs it again given you 3 ads,negative
"I don't like the new update because I can't skip songs, I can't drag in timestamps and this app suddenly add songs that I didn't put in my playlist.",negative
"I get that you need to show ads to be profitable and grow your company but the amount of ads your app is showing me is just crazy, I counted the ads last time, I was playing a playlist and after playing minimum 1 to maximum 3 songs this app showed me a 30-50 seconds ad, in other words 5-6 ads in an hour. You do realise that you're just driving me away instead of persuading me to buy the premium? Please reconsider your ad amount.",negative
Love Spotify. Do recommend for anyone who's thinking about downloading it.,positive
I bloody love this app. A bit buggy at times (especially offline) which cost it the full 5.,positive
"Offers all the artists & podcasts that I want, but every update makes it worse. It's been a year and this is still true.",neutral
It's kinda slow sometimes but then again it might be my phone but so far it has been nothing but amazing,positive
"It does what it does, unfortunately not well but not like there's much better options. The app basically decides what you can't do and when. Want to actually listen to songs only from your playlist? Too bad! Here's a song that's not even in it! Want to repeat your music? OOPS! Gotta pay for that! Want to listen to a song on its own? Why would you! Here's a playlist that you have to skip through! Had the app for 4 months when out of the blue it started limiting what I can do. Annoying app.",negative
Why my Spotify doesn't have a loop icon ! I'm so frustrated,negative
Amazing App..Smooth interface.. great collection,positive
"Too many ads like seriously...now they are giving ads after every song..and they keep saying ""music ad free hi accha lgta hain"" dn don't give ads ... No matter how they try to change our minds with their ad style I am not gonna pay to listen music ... I would rather sleep...worst app ever",negative
Love the way the music is displayed and organized,positive
Fix your systems! Cannot play more than 3 sec and stop. Cut my premium 'cos of this,negative
Tis fine but Ads should be skippable atleast,positive
For me it's very cool music app,positive
Love Spotify!! I use it literally everyday!,positive
"This app is good, plus the quality isnt that bad, but its too restricting I cant even play the album I want, its just gonna play the song that isnt on the album or it plays the suggested song. Plus the ad is so loud for no reason, even louder than the song itself. The ads are annoying too, it just pops up infront of your face. I have a 27hr spoti playlist and some of the songs is repetitive it plays over 2 times while the other songs never play.",negative
Great music and service,positive
one of the best music platform but I didn't find any music's lyrics,positive
This app is good for listening song but ytf ur giving add continued after one song?,negative

I'm boutta switch to YouTube music fr yall making me miss out on too much,negative

Fun and relaxed way of listening to music and podcasts,positive

And it can even auto-pause your music when you are on a different app that includes game music, or something! But for the people that did not give Spotify a five star, you should now! Again, this is a great app! Thank you!!!!",positive
"Im here to rate Spotify not cuz It's good or anything like that. But to appreciate their amazing Marketing plan. The voice that says ""ever wonder how the other side lived"" is sooooooooo annoying that ppl would ""Switch back"" to premium just so they don't have to hear that voice👏🏽",neutral
"can't choose song, can't skip song, too many ads",negative
So today bug is I have no play or pause or anything to stop music. I can select a song and it plays. But I can't pause it or anything. Lol,negative
"Why do you need my card details for free premium😡 Songs in liked list dissapears out of the blue.song search needs a lot of improvements. Anything good in this app Is its ads, very irritating, just like they wanted it.",negative
"Edit: they patched spotify to encourage users to buy premium, otherwise free version is pandora clone. Premium is worth it tho.",positive
Love it but it's been laggy lately,positive
Not as easy to navigate and search as others,positive
Honestly love this app gets me through my day and works well the adds aren't so consistent so it doesn't really bother but I would love to atleast have the control over changing my songs even if I'm not signed up for the premium version but still a pretty good app,positive
"Super annoying to use for both podcasts and music. When listening to a podcast, sometimes it will skip either way back or way forward, so you have to be on the app just to see if the podcast is on the right EP. Plus Ads are atrocious. Sometimes the 30 min uninterrupted won't work. And if it does work, when it's up you'll get about 4 ads in a row before you can listen to your playlist again. What happened to this app? If there was a better music app, I would've switched long ago.",negative
"even though having premium is amazing, there's still a lot that spotify offers :) i love the personalized mixes",positive
Y'all are the best music app ever,positive
"This app is amizaing cuz you can listen to music anytime you want, and after the update it got starting to be restrocting cuz of the shuffle plays and i can't listen to music properly, please remove the shuffle play",negative
Sweet sweet every song by my favorite artist just like that so cool,positive
Wonderful variety of music is excellent,positive

"Best app if you are sad or bored you can listen your favourite music, podcasts, Artist or playlists I like this application",positive
I have internet connection and other apps is working good but in Spotify it shows no connection while searching.... What is this.?? Tactics to get more premium membership.... Very cheap and annoying Worst experience....,negative
"Spotify is evil. It's owned by the music industry. This is their way of paying the artist they already barely pay even less. And don't forget, the crumbs that they pay the artist from Spotify is still 75% their. So when they ""pay"" an artist a dollar the artist gets .25 cents and they keep the rest. Spotify is the most disgusting thing these greedy record companies could come up with. They already rape their artist and take all the money they make in exchange for doing nothing at all.",negative
I'm paying 9.99 every month still it is another month not getting what ads.last payment 16/1/22,neutral
I don't like how it can turn on by itself when I try to listen to video on my car and it will start running not a good thing needs to be delt with soon,negative

"Randomly stopping while playing and when I restart app or song, there are no controls on screen.",negative
"I like the app, and I can find music relatively easily. The only issues I have are that if I add too little songs to a playlist, Spotify adds more, and there are so many ads. I can barely go 5 songs without getting 5x the ads. I understand that premium features are to earn money, but limiting skips and features that some people need but can't afford behind a price is not understandable to me.",negative
The app is easy to use and produces good sound quality when subscribed to premium. The downside is you have a lot of missing songs 🤦🏻‍♂️,positive
Literally only good paid or on a computer,neutral
Was good. Started getting glitchy over last couple of months until it stopped working. Despite reinstalling ap. will change to someting else.,negative
"After updated, i lost my all playlist on this apps. But if i opened on deskop, yeah, i can see my all play list on deskop. Please fix it",positive
I like this app and uses it practically everyday or whenever I need to listen to music only problems is that some of the ads to me are weird but other than that really good,positive
"You shouldnt have to buy premium to play an individual song, instead of it randomly generating a playlist and shuffling it into it for you to find.",negative
Why you gotta play adds before the song even ends bruh,negative
Random log out and when I log in again with the same email and password saying that my password is incorrect. Very enjoyable music player. So I gave you my 1 star :)),negative
"So I got asked to leave a review again, not changing it from 1 star because, while I use it everyday, I would jump apps in a heartbeat it someone made a better podcast app. I pay for spotify. Any justification for ads on podcasts when I pay FOR NO ADS is BS.",negative
Crashes all the time and won't play downloaded music or Podcast half the time,negative
"Great app for music but missing so many tracks from so many artists and gives preference to iOS devices for updates and features, appreciate if swipe to queue feature is rolled out soon enough, as the iOS users have been enjoying this feature since years.",positive

"The Android app continues to suffer from years-long issues. Failing to detect internet connection, randomly closing, weekly playlists not updating, playback stopping entirely or momentarily a couple of times a minute. On both a Samsung Note 9 and now still on my S22 Ultra. Constantly needing to clear all data and reinstall the app. The iOS version is much more reliable.",negative
Best way to listen to our favorite 🎶 music,positive

This is a pretty great app. There's just a couple problems I can't explain,positive
"When I first got the app, I really enjoyed it. No ads, could play whatever I wanted, etc. But just today they put in this awful update that makes it so you can only preview songs in a playlist, making it hard for you to pick and choose which song you want to play when playing the playlist at once. I'm suddenly getting ads and limited skips now, something that wasn't happening before. And this only happened within the last 2 weeks of getting the app. Sorry guys, not spending money on music.",neutral
When I pick a song it always plays a different song please fix this bug.,neutral
Great to listening to music,positive
"Premium user , my downloaded songs keep getting deleted from time to time and I Have to uninstall , reinstall , and then Re-download music all again. Why am i paying for a service that instead of making things easier , it's making it harder for me. Unacceptable",positive
"Has been great, hate to say that too early though...",positive
Awesome great music.,positive
"Why should I download offline and I won't be able to view the lyrics unless I switch to online mode. If I use Spotify, it's because of the lyrics Please work on this. The lyrics should be downloadable offline. Treat as URGENT until then it's a 3 star",neutral
"Love Spotify, but please move the ""heart"" button so it's not next to the ""cast"" button. I unheart songs all the time and it is so annoying!!! Please move the cast icon to the left of the song titles rather than kn the right next to the play/pause.",positive
Its great but it glitches sometimes!,positive
"It's good but I have a beef with Spotify in that I can't get certain songs on it, and sometimes a song I have will be taken away unannounced for some reason. Last thing, shuffle play isn't great. I have 600 plus songs. I shouldn't be having the same few songs show up for days in a row. It's good though. I can barely keep up with all the recommendation playlists.",positive
"Somehow my favourite tracks are hidden in one of my playlists (which I never did) and I can't unhide them. I have switched on ""Show unplayable songs"" in my settings but the ""Hidden"" Button is still broken. Please fix this, I'm paying money for this app each month.",neutral

Has worked perfectly across multiple phones my sync system in my F350 operates it for hands free, it does take a little time to figure out the bells and whistles of it but once you do it works great!

Needs to be just the song or Playlist that is chosen to be played by the listener and needs to have no premium and should be add free,positive
Because I find all the songs that I'm looking for and I like,positive
What is up with all these updates there is literally an update every other day just make one big update and leave it alone for a bit. I feel that everytime I want to listen to music I need to update it first. Literally your last update was on June 19th and there was just another one today on June 23rd think of these updates all at once if you can cause all these constant ones are just annoying at this point. I love listening to music on this app but I feel I'm doing more updating than listening.,neutral
Spotify is the best application to listen musics and play podcasts.İt is functional and pretty easy to use.I have never experineced any tecnical problems so far and I can almost find the every song that I wish to play!Sound quality is amazing and playlist accses is more refined compared to other apps.You can convinietnly connect it to various devices and play in different platforms.I would be so glad if Spotify crew made those facilities that I mentioned more reachable for free users too:-),positive
I really enjoy Spotify. Great improvement from what I was listening to.,positive
Why the hell Bluetooth headsets of all brands get disconnected while using this app. When will you ever rectify this? Irritating to the core,negative
Maybe I will rate it 5star after I have maybe enjoyed the spotify,negative

Too many ads.,negative
Not working properly,negative
Since the update. Spotify has change layout on mine and not on other people I know. Also doesnt play the right songs that are in the album of playlist. As play artists and songs that are not in the playlist or album. Edit: Still the same set up and its shuffling albums and play music from artists that aint put in playlist. Also playing music from different artists even tho in a specific artist album.,neutral
Still a solid choice for music,positive
I like how you can select singers & groups ahead of time. Also the app puts together a daily mix based on your listening choices.,positive
The best app to listen to my favourite music nice.... HD sound nice experience. The app is also easy to use. But the only thing in this app is.. The ads. I can't even listen to next of my favourite song bcoz of the ads. I get a ad after every single song and the same as and the same type of ad like: don't like interruption while doing this or that so buy Spotify premium. What if I don't have money to spend on some apps or if my prents don't allow to use money on apps. Then what should I do?,neutral
Spotify is the best😎.Trust me😌👌,positive
I love Spotify because it lets me be me and not what it wants to make me to fit in. It offers me all that I want in music; there is nothing I have not found in search and their expanded program is awesome. Premium is wonderful and so inexpensive! I am sorry I waited so long to get it!,positive
Suddenly the song stops and starts after an hr. I mean wat is this. Is someone controlling our device???,neutral
I can't get threw a day of work or home for that matter without my Spotify best app I ever used,positive

Need to vary the ads more.,positive
Great app however I would like to have the option of deleting certain songs from the suggested playlist,positive

Guys I don't need add free music stop giving this amount of add... It's toooo much annoying for me,negative
Amazing Just amzing I love it and the premium Pack Is So good to use,positive
The algorithm knows my music tastes and gives good recommendations. I like the features that let you queue your playlist and edit as well. The collaboration and privacy features are good. I wish there was easier ways to set the sleep timer but the fact that it's there and has so many time options is fantastic. The radios are great and convenient. Overall recommend.,positive
"Sportify is really a wonderful app, I was actually shocked when it created a playlist for me and in the playlist was actually the kind of music I listen to and some were particularly the songs I love. Am giving it a 5 rating start because the application and the team deserve it, it's really a wonderful app. I will be glad if I could get a free month subscription tho😊",positive
"I've found that if I ask for one song by a certain artist, it is followed by a nice playlist that Spotify has put together and I can just listen all day without getting bored!",positive
There's really a need for you to understand how annoying your ads are,positive
"As others here have mentioned, the app is quite buggy. Constantly stopping playback for no reason, playbar freezing, and play button refusing to start songs. I'm currently looking for a different streaming service as Spotify refuses to ammend this issue and its gotten to the point where I spend more time fixing the app than listening to my favourite podcasts and music.",negative

Didn't realise when I downloaded that it's a trial experience and after a couple of weeks they pretty much make it useless to use. No thanks. Back to Amazon Music for me,negative

Excellent app for all music needs.,positive
As convenient as the app is its got some glaring issues. First of all if you download songs it still streams them vs using the download files. I know this because when I try to play a band I've downloaded it always delays going to an album or song if internet gets in a patchy area. As soon as I put it on airplane mode it works fine. Unlike the YouTube app where you download and it'll always play the downloaded video. I feel like this app is 15 yrs behind what other apps have figured out in 09,neutral
Really?3 ads every time I start anything?,negative
"Well, Spotify is great as always, but the Android app has a few rough edges around Chrome Cast: 1. Disconnecting wireless headphones while casting breaks the cast, the app switchws to on device playback through the phone's speakers 2.

One of the best music streaming services out there. The premium membership is definently worth the price for no ads and higher music quality.

2 stars becuase its a way to listen to music when playing xbox but the amount of ads you get ruins the whole thing. 4 songs and then 6 ads is what i tend to get most the time. Im looking for alternatives so i can listen to music on my xbox without being bombarded with ads,neutral

Use to be great. Had Spotify for a long time offline always worked well and stuff downloaded. Now it's super slow to pull up Playlist and sometimes doesnt work at all offline even though I pay. Not sure this app is worth paying for anymore.,neutral

Feel it hard to interact with as without premium you are forced to listen to other songs than the one you want. Which is annoying.,neutral

In the last week Spotify keeps dropping In the middle of a song or in the middle of a Podcast and it does it repetitively about every 3-5 minutes. This needs to get fixed! I love spotify but I may have to change if it doesn't get addressed.,negative

My Spotify Mobile app skips more than my old Walkman even when I have full signal. Friends send me links to songs for Spotify and it never opens up to the song they sent me so I just have to look it up myself. Want to create a blend with me?

Great music app hardly plays any ads but it sometimes pauses the music on its own and it can be annoying if you don't have premium. But overall it's a great app and I really would recommend it.,positive
Like the options the app has easy to add and remove from existing Playlist,positive
Good but there's a lot of ad :(,positive
Now that spotify has got lyrics for most of it's songs!! It's become way better!! 💞✨,positive

Tired of seeing COVID-19 tags nonstop simply because a podcast talks about it.,negative
Spotify is one of the good app for listening music.. But suggestion of the next song is not based on my previous/similar intrest.. Hence you have to work on the Artificial Intelligence & Machine learning so that similar songs can be suggested to the music lovers.. Just check on the YouTube how they are suggesting the similar songs..,negative
Just perfect.But ads where residuals and they can be removed by,positive
Waw all features are good 👍,positive

They charge me twice a month and won't stop when I ask them to. Terrible customer service.,negative
Some of my favorite songs are no longer available.,positive
It was okay but then they updated it and all of a sudden I can only listent to my Playlist on shuffle mode. I also can't just listen to any song individually. They say it's free but you really have to buy premium to get anything good to come out of it.,negative
Offline not supported.,neutral
Worst app I donno but everytime I play a song it suddenly stops working and I uninstalled this app then installed I update this app every time but again after one day it stops working . And this is happening with me from more than 6 months I am sure I'm not gonna install this app again !!!,negative
"Works great have zero issues. I know its mainly used for music but fingers crossed they add a lot more books in the long run, already a good variety and abundance though so I'm rating 5 stars.",positive
"The app constantly stops during play. The user interface is not designed very well, from the swiping that advances to the next podcast, to the fact that I cannot organize my podcasts. If it wasn't for Joe Rogan only being on Spotify, I'd use another podcast app.",negative

I really like listening to podcast on Spotify,positive

Best music app ever I recommend this app to everyone i know,positive
It's a good app and I like the fact that I get every song I want to..,positive
I'm giving it two stars because of a glitch Spotify has while sharing a song link to Snapchat. Like the song link is bizzarely placed with the image..... Usually when I was sharing I never had these problems but now it's too annoying. Like trying to place the link over the image is in itself a glitch. Please try to rectify it.,negative
Good but advertisement,positive
this app would be amazing if it weren't for how many adds there are for non premium users its actually so bad i get 7 adds in a row sometimes in-between songs and the same add sometimes plays again straight after it was already played for some reason they are so frequent too and they always use the same exact adds for weeks on end and having to listen to those things so many times a day when i just want to listen to music is driving me insane i literally know them all word for word now,negative
"I do like this app and I listen my favorite songs of every bands I listen. The problem that I encounter is the shuffle whenever listening to a song it's always change to other music or songs. Pls do something about this but I will still give 5 stars for this app. But, pls fix those issues and problems of Spotify.",positive

"Watched a ""watch this for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music"" ad, hoping for an ad free shower. One song played, and when it was over it immediately played three ads back to back. Thought maybe it was a glitch, but when i heard at least two ads after every song, I knew I'd been lied to. This is the kind of thing I'd expect from YouTube, but I truly thought Spotify was better than that. Please, don't make me have to find a new favorite music source after at least 7 years of dedication to you!",negative
"Ads! So many! They promised 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening but sure enough, after 10 or so minutes there's at least 3 or 4 ads playing...",negative
Please fix what is wrong with this app. It keeps stopping in mid play..I have uninstalled and installed very often. Getting sick of it.,negative

Very easy to use and enjoying to listen music,positive
"Great music app. More enjoyable with spotify premium so theres no ads, but I feel like there could be less ads when you don't have premium. When you do an online mix, I think it's fine with ads to be on every few songs, but if your are listening to a playlist you made, i think there shouldn't be ads. And don't get me started on the limited skips. At that point I would just used YT music. I have been using premium for a while, so I don't know if the limited skips has been changed.",positive
"The app is fine. But it's been 2 years and they're still showing ads during podcasts to premium users. If you want podcasts, go elsewhere unless you don't mind ads despite paying over $10 Canadian. If you only want music the app itself is easy to use and pretty intuitive. I found the ads excessive without premium, but no where near as bad as YouTube.",neutral
Overall Spotify has been a great way to listen to music. I love making playlists and listening to other stations and playlists too. Thank you!,positive
Nice App for music while you workout or go for a walk. Ads are not to bad and they only pop up every so often.,positive
One of the better streaming services.,positive
"It's unbelievable how often this app crashes, pauses for no reason, or simply refuses to load or play anything, including downloaded songs. The queues often dont function. And I'm skeptical that ""shuffle"" truly is shuffled at all, the same songs always come up. Truly just a trash app. Spotify employees should focus more on doing their job and spend less time complaining about content.",negative
Honestly I don't see anything wrong with this app. I've never had any issues with Spotify or anything like that.,positive
Exceptional but slow,positive
Very good .....way better than audio mack......,neutral
I really do like it but you adding songs to my playlist when it MY playlist I don't like how you just added songs without me verifying but other than that an ok app,positive

Spotify is cool. Easy to browse,positive
Excellent. Very useful and enjoyable!,positive
I think its good i can feel the music its not free but its nice app,positive
"It's great to have an app for music, but the ads have become ridiculous! I'm getting four ads after one or two songs now and I can't afford the subscription currently... I really wanna know what happened to the 30 min ad free ""sessions"" that used to happen cause those were great for road trips.",negative
Too much ads,positive
"Easy to use, great way to organize playlists, so much accessibility. Love it.",positive
"They say that this app is the front runner but it doesn't look so. The add to queue option is working in a very dumb manner. Whenever a song/ album/ playlist is required to be added to queue, it means to the end of the existing queue of songs. This is the logical thought for any layman. However Spotify adds songs next to the current song that is playing, this is a basic app mistake and i am thinking of cancelling the subscription i made. Hope they correct this basic mistake.",negative
Incredible app. Easy to select songs and play,positive
Loved building a Playlist together for our romantic vacation.,positive
Wonderful and reliable app,positive
"""Enjoy the next 30 minutes of ad-free listening."" Time to next ad: 15.5 minutes. This is a small issue, but it errodes my trust in your brand and contributes to my hesitation about getting a premium subscription.",negative
"I like how easy to use Spotify is. I've been on the family plan for a while, but when I wasn't, the ads weren't too bad or too frequent. I do prefer being on premium in order to control skips, which song is next, etc (idk what the perks are now, I've had premium for a while). I like the ability to have mixed playlists with my friends",positive
I love this app! U can make playlists by just searching an artist or song and I love the quality of the music. But I got few problems. I hate the limited skipping music and I hate when I'm listening to my music in the playlist and then suddenly it changes to a song who's not in the playlist and I don't even know the song. And I was searching for an app who can be free to listen to music offline. But on this app that's premium. I'll rate ur app 5 stars if you let us listen to music offline free.,negative
Good but some music missing that I like,positive
Excellent n easy to access music,positive
"I don't mind the app, the music side is okay, maybe a bit annoying at times but it's the free version so I can't complain. But I do have a problem with the podcast side of things. Recently it won't let me listen to anything, even the ones I've downloaded. I've tried deleting and reinstalling the app but that hasn't done anything.",negative
Good app 👌 👍 👏 for listening 🎶 👌 music hope you all guy's enjoying stay blessed all ❤ ❤,positive
Too many bugs. I honestly might as well stick to YouTube because I get like 5 ads every 3 songs. The only thing that keeps me using this is the podcast and I have to uninstall and reinstall the app daily just to listen to them,negative
"There's a plenty of problem in this app right now.First, whenever I click on the I wanted it's always different song. It's really irritating and when I play songs in my playlist it always comes out in different ways and another song comes in between. The older version is better than this one right now",negative
the app always play the less popular songs..youtube is far far better... if a user asks for an artis.. then play the songs frm the artist.. dont play other songs from other singers... and play the top songs not the unknown songs.,negative
Beneficial whilst having my long bath...listening to History of Rome padcast,positive
This app has helped me through so much. My playlist is almost 69 hours worth of music from all different genres. I find tons of new music I enjoy everyday. Spotify premium isn't very expensive and it's totally worth it. Spotify has quite literally saved my life. 💚🖤,positive
I will give 5 stars if you guys add the shortcuts with volume keys to skip tracks on the Galaxy s22 Ultra. Please add!!!,positive
Always has what I am looking for.,positive

Changed my comment since last time since more info came to light. However! You're the biggest music app on the planet. The bugs are starting to get annoying. Controlling another device shows a completely different song playing as example,neutral

Very nice application spotify,positive
Superb quality. Funtastic podcasts. And all the songs available.... In short entertainment at our earpods....,positive
"The ""premium"" algorithm is hot garbage. The UI is deliberately cumbersome and ugly, and for whatever reason the developers think that ""playlist"" means shove a bunch awful songs into a carefully chosen list constructed by a paying customer. Would never recommend this to someone who actually likes music. If you just wanna listen to Joe Rogan, I guess it's ok.",negative
"Spotify is my go-to app. Driving to work, at work, in the gym, cooking at home, cleaning you name it. Spotify is my jam. Hope they start implementing more videos like with Joe Rogans podcast",positive
"You guys have to decrease the number of ads , it's like i usually listen to songs for about 1-2 hours continuously and Spotify increase the rate of ads per ad , for using this much long you better decrease the rate of ads🙌",negative
I enjoy the selection and the podcasts as a truck driver I listen a lot. The bad score is because I can't turn off autoplay. As soon as my phone connects the app turns on and starts playing and I will end up deleting the app if not fixed.,negative
Too much ads like forever.,negative
Too many ads,negative

I dont like it . I picked a song I wanted and it keeps shuffling it it's just confusing,negative
"Bro if your gonna increase the ad in between the music, and irritating people your gonna lose a lot of people. One add between 5-6 songs is okay and done. 2-3 ads btw 1-2 song is crusome.

"I'm the type of person who prefer Premium Mini for when I feel the mood to listen to music seamlessly for the whole day. BUT the process of purchasing premium mini through spotify is so frustrating it kept on ""unable to connect"" and I've been ""retry""-ing for half an hour. My signal is pretty good but spotify doesn't even let me try to pay for my premium purchase 😩",neutral

It doesn't play the full song you click on,negative
Have to re download again as I try to play one album but after first song is done it plays a completely different mix. Not the first time and it's painful every time as I have to re download all of the songs I want to hear in low reception areas,negative
"I can carry with me, My entire collection, the soundtracks of my life.",positive
"The issues I have are with its compatibility with Google assistant. Half of the time when requested to play something, it plays a completely unrelated song. For example for a while when asked to play Kelly Clarkson, it would actually play Kelly CARSON, a largely unheard of cover singer... it's quite frustrating when all you want is hands free compatibility.",negative
great music selection and streaming quallity,positive
its the best i absoluty love it i love lisening to spotifi,positive
Nice app for listening song and podcast and funny things also,positive
Spotify mess up for me and won't work. It is so bad 😭😭😭,negative
"Great Music App, but I think it will be even more better if developer adds a sort of Volume control in the app for the gamers who love to play music/podcast while playing🥰",positive
I wish I could listen to an entire pod cast without it stopping for no reason and making me re open the app and pressing play again before I can continue the pod cast.,negative
"A couole things. First you used to be able to preview a song in the ""Add songs"" and now you can't. Second way too many adds for free listeners. Third if youre listening on any other device besides mobile for free listiners you have unlimited skips, repeat, can select a song and hear that song without having to skip to it, and your playlist don't automaticly shuffle. Yet on mobile you only get six skips per hour, no repeat, can't choose which song you want, and your playlist automaticly shuffle.",negative

Love the app. Great for listening to music.,positive
One of the best playlist ever made,positive

Great music have the ability to have ad free but if you choose not to if it do have an ad maybe one or two consider it to your style of music when she request a song it plays and bring up other songs similar to that stuff,positive

"The spotify experience has been amazing so far, it's additional function (lyrics) included in each music/podcast played by users make life easy.",positive
Spotify only Play adds,negative
Each Time I play a certain song and even when I add it to my playlist. This is kind of annoying and I wish it can be fixed if it can.,neutral
I love this when I'm in a mood I have a Playlist that calms me down I turn that on and fall in love and relax/chill,positive
Payment for premium will not let me buy it and it keeps saying something went wrong,negative
To many commercials. 10 dang commercials to get 15 minutes of music. WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. ITS AS BAD AS REGULAR RADIO NOW,negative
"Keeps crashing. When you skip ads it starts playing at a different place, basically I think just self sabotaging to force me to buy premium, which I never will.",negative
"Only thing I would change is when I make a file of songs, don't put in suggestions. I made that file to listen to the songs I chose.",positive
I just wish there weren't as many ads. Also if you share an account 2 people can't use it at once. But other than that it's a great app!,negative
"Fast pace life, play and go!!",positive
Hands down the absolute best And only Music App you will ever need. Phenomenal at predicting more favorites for you to listen to 💯🤍,positive
"They need to fix the update like soon enough. A lot of songs that aren't in my fav songs are getting in whenever I shuffle, The only way I fix it by deleting spotify and downloading again. It is a pretty good app tho.",positive
Its been buggy as of late. Kinda annoying. Please fix.,neutral
Easy favourites and good suggestions,positive
new update since 6/22/2022 9 gigabytes of space on my internal storage with no option to move to my SD card which doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Alot has been fixed otherwise since my last review in 2019 but would like to see the ability to move it to external storage.,neutral

This app has amazing sound quality.but can't download music from this app and many as issues also after all good 👍,negative
"I pay to use this, and for the most part, no issues. It does occasionally skip to some other song, and it always wants me to go to car mode while in the car. Car mode is TERRIBLE! I always keep it off.",positive

It used to be so good but now I can never get it to work it always says no internet connection available but I have internet because I can use Google YouTube Instagram and everything but Spotify just will not connect to the internet,negative
"Deleted songs. I pay for premium. I should have close to 3,000 songs but Spotify thinks because I don't listen to 'em I'm a certain time frame that I'll forget about them. I'll have some saved for over a year, won't listen to it and I come back and it's somehow unsaved AGAIN. I pay for premium so I can listen to music when I don't have signal for Internet. It's so dang frustrating!",negative
Excellent selection; very intuitive when finding music for us based on our own choices; super fast downloads,positive
Spotify is a good app and all but recently I'll be listening to songs on my liked and then it will play songs that I never added nor have I ever heard off Is there a reason for this I'd like to know,neutral
I love this it helps me when times are ruff,positive
It has most the songs you want to hear great app,positive
"Spotify is my most used and favourite app. I think of myself as a ""power user"" and I'm curious of how the Spotify team sees me. All this rating business to me is pretty tired. Having my phone ask to rate an app is something I simply don't care to do for the most part. I start to wonder, when will we move past this need to be better. When can we just let be what is. When can we transcend to a place where everyone has access to the best music all the time because we know music heals and is good.",positive
"The best music streaming platform ever, it even comes with offline access to all the downloaded songs. Before it, l was missing out a lot, look at me now 😁😁😁😁😁all smiles.",positive
Been using it for years. Great app.,positive

Best app for music when you have premium!,positive
"App has gotten a lot better. Still prefer the old UI, but eh... What are you gonna do.",positive
"Everything is good about Spotify. The best being that the app is always on night mode which reduces the strain on eyes, especially if you're like me who uses the music app like for the whole day. The only problem is that some songs and episodes are not available in your region, and I don't know why that happens. Overall, it's a must try app.",positive
"Unfortunately, Sharing songs on Instagram stories doesn't work, please fix this",positive
I love it. I use it all the time. I do pay for it. I get the 3 month thing at Wal-Mart.,positive
"I've been using Spotify for years and I love it! It's super easy to navigate. But as of late the lyrics have stopped showing up on songs, from my understanding it's a glitch in the app but maybe I'm wrong. Another issue I've had, like many other's, is the ads. There are way too many and they put them in way too often.",positive

Canceled my premium and they charged me AND when I checked if I even got premium I DIDNT so they stole my money 😐 unbelievable.

Perfect place to search olden music,positive
If you like music you'll love Spotify !,positive
I enjoy listening to various talented artists. Thank you 😊,positive
"It's good, but that doesn't mean I like it that much. You can only skip 6 songs an hour, the playlists are completely random, and they add random songs to playlists. That's just a bit annoying, I think. Also, you can get rid of those problems by paying? That's a cash grab up there with, like, Bethesda, dude. Still, it has access to every song imaginable and plenty of great podcasts. It's basically a good app if you don't the interuptions.",neutral
Awesome music app. Spotify as everything I want to listen too.,positive
"I don't like how to made it uninteresting to be honest, Why can't I repeat the current song anymore? And why can't I play the full song? Why is it all review?",negative
That one thing you didn't know you would be lost some kind of way without. Music for the soul child in me feel found.,positive
Not to bad premium is overpriced and no deal for students in Australia at high school.,negative
"Constantly plays irrelevant songs to my playlist, and I can't seem to have songs play from a specific artist, only some mix (which includes anything BUT the artist), and I can't play a song in my liked queue nor close the app or else it'll play a new, irrelevant song.",negative
It's an easy app to use and the selection is endles,positive
This is so awesome to used because I get to listen to anything I want it is the best but there is one problem can you please put it as much skipping as we want. Please,positive
Very useful all music I wanted choose no problem,positive

App is really great an amazing always working great a few times there is a few problems but other than that it's perfect,positive
"I hate this with all my heart this app is sooooo stupid because you have a limit to how many songs you can skip and I'm just trying to listen to the songs I LIKED and it just decides to give a similar song if I like a song I will like it of not don't give me those songs I can't even listen to like 3 songs before it gives me a ""similar"" recommendation it is sooo stupid and I thought that I selected a setting to make it stop and it didn't Spotify on phone is so stupid",negative
Very buggy app. Tons of ads which are also broken (it says after the ads 30 mins of uninterrupted and then 5 mins later you get ads again). Constant issues with performance and premium is now unaffordable. Seems to be getting worse and worse. Do better Spotify.,negative
After every 2 songs ads 🤬 can't even enjoy the music because of ads 🤬,negative
"Super glitchy :((( Always crashing, never shows the play menu so you can't control what you're playing. Consistently having to uninstall and reinstalling just to get it to work, sometimes multiple times a day",negative

Horrible. Can't go back in a song or Listen to a specific song without premium. unless you have the funds for a premium account it's absolutely not worth it,negative
Very helpful to listening of music,positive
Very good app to listen to music especially when you have premium,positive
"Spotify used to be great for listening to music. Unfortunetely they are forcing randomized play unless you are a premium subscriber. The premium service offered is worth, at most, $2.99/month, not $9.99",negative
"Ok I love the app and all, but recently the new update is absolute garbage if you don't have premium. There's an ""add songs"" feature and usually you can listen to their 15 second preview to determine whether it's good enough to add but they TOOK IT AWAY? Update: THEY ACTUALLY PUT IT BACK YAY",positive
took money twice but didnt give premium(chutiya app),negative
Price plans are too expensive and artist aren't given enough share of income just listen with ads until Spotify support artist fairly,negative
"This is literally the most savage way off forcing people to buy premium. You can not listen to the songs you want (which is literally the whole point of such apps) because it will only shuffle through playlists, giving you 6 free skips until you can't skip songs anymore. On desktop you can do everything you'd expect for FREE! But here they just want to rip you off. Screw this company! Better do something good with your money than spend it on premium for features your media player already has.",negative
Great music and plays your favorite list of artist.,positive
"Im just trying to listen to the music i want. I dont want to listen to some other songs i dont like. I had to watch tutorials on youtube ""How to listen liked songs on spotify""",negative
"Better than Pandora. After a while the randomization of Pandora's shuffle ends up grouping a few songs by the same artist back to back. I get that that's part of the shuffle, but when it happens quite frequently it's noticeably annoying",positive
I used the free version before deciding on going premium and it's the best decision I could've done. Now I've been on premium for 6 or 7 years now !! Would definitely recommend going premium if you can 🫶🏽,positive
good quick source of music,positive
Why can't I remove a song from a Playlist on the fly? And why can't I put a song on the shelf for a while like w Pandora?,neutral
App is crashing all the time and the sd card option was gone,negative
Ty I enjoy music 🎶 on Spotify.,positive
Sometimes the app just skips to the end of the podcast after an advisement. Now I have to scan through the podcast to find where Spotify decided I had to move on but fought back. If Joe Rogan wasn't on this app I would NEVER use it.,negative
"The worst app I've had to use, love spotify but what's the point if I can't ever use it. I pay for premium just for the app to be nonfunctional for half the month because either my phone or spotify updated and now it just doesn't work. Nope still broken",negative
I don't know what is happening but i can't play songs online and I can't download my playlist. Help me,negative

"The app isn't bad, however there are several issues. Firstly, you can make a playlist of songs you want, however you can't choose which to listen to, but have to play shuffle, and even then you either play shuffle again or skip a song (6 skips every hour is ridiculously low amount) to get to what you want. After every song there are 3-4 ads. I understand it is a free service, but considering artist are barely even payed, this is ridiculous. Overall would just recommend downloading songs instead.",negative
I love listening to music on here. I have given it a 4 star because of 2 reasons 1) there is adds all the time. 2) you can't listen to it offline. I would be more joyful (to me) if we didn't have adds all the time and we can listen to music offline. Apart from that it's amazing.,positive
"Really good experience with Spotify, but sometimes the bar to pass to the next song just disappear and I have to reset it",positive
It's good but why can't we play offline music,positive
"Spotify is a great app; a one stop shop for good music with inbuilt lyrics to help anyone sing along. My issue however, the personalized playlist should be more flexible. People should be able to play a particular song at will instead of the shuffle play.",positive

Fine playing but can't download,neutral
Everytime I try to listen to My Playlist it plays some random songs that I haven't added and if I try to skip it I run out of Skips because I have free Spotify it's not that I don't have enough songs on my playlist I have over 150 W I can't listen to them and I have to listen to some other stuff,negative

"Avoid the free version at all costs. They have gone to great lengths to make listening to specific songs impossible. Not only is there no way to turn off shuffle, but spotify will also add similar songs into the mix, forcing you to skip whenever these come on. That is rather annoying by itself, especially when driving or otherwise occupied, but in case that wasn't bad enough, there's of course also a limit on how many times you're able to skip. The design is openly hostile to the user, avoid it.",negative
Newest update has issues. Sometimes I'll leave the app open in the background and music will just stop randomly. Sometimes on shuffle the app will somehow lose track of what song is playing and it'll play 2 different songs at the same time. Closing the app with 2 songs playing and one song will continue to play despite me closing the app completely and there no way to stop it,neutral
It quite working an I can't use. It.,negative
I have no problems with it and they have all the music I've been looking for,positive
"This is an app that is impossible to run freely, so get premium it's worth it having your own library to play whenever you want. But my issues is Spotify's attitude toward musicians who get paid little from this service and choose to leave. Between YouTube music and this, YouTube Music is superior because EVERY artist and song is there.",negative
The best app for Spotify,positive
You give sooo many ads...can't even listen to songs peacefully,negative
The app switches to ads about 5 mins in and then restarts or moves to the next podcast in the list. Garbage. UPDATE: Half a year and it still randomly crashes and shuts off my podcasts...,negative
Great Music! Great Access!,positive

Spotify double charged me for a year and a half and I didn't notice. One month last year they charged me 4 times on the same day. I canceled my subscription in November 21 and they continued to charge me. The only reason I noticed any of it was because I was looking through my transaction history. I am not impressed and will definitely be deleting my account. Not to mention I've been going back and forth with the customer service representative for days. They do not have a phone number either.,negative
this is great app. Low monthly fee without ads. Any music can be found,positive

I tried downloading podcast episodes to listen to offline and then Spotify wouldn't work without Internet so there was no point in downloading the episodes,negative
It makes listening to Joe Rogan a painful experience. It resets on me and I have to find my spot atleast four times a podcast. The only conceivable reason to use Spotify is the Joe Rogan contract. Iheart radio and youtube music are superior in every way. The only way it could be worse was if it crashed on startup.,negative
Spotify used to be a brilliant app and I have always enjoyed listening music on it but this new update is simply pathetic. It is now only usable for premium users. Non premium cannot even listen to the music of their own choice without shuffle. I cannot rewind or repeat the song and have to bear the playlist I don't want to listen.,negative

Worst app ever...i purchased premium duo twice to listen song with my friends.. In mobile app it show your package is active and in web it say no package purchase.. are you guys high or what? If you want free money just beg. Don't make stupid app's or just for once fix the issues.,negative

"I am going to rant how annoying this app is. First off on mobile it auto shuffles Playlists and it's annoying when I have them perfectly made. Second when I play albums to Bands it won't play the album songs in order nor have them complete, it will have some album songs and than shuffle in and other songs, so I generally have to make a Playlist just for the album (which will shuffle on mobile). Third it's algorithm doesn't hit as hard as Youtube's for finding new Bands/Albums.",negative
"The app gives free users no freedom, unlike the computer version.",negative
Installed bit won't even open. Checked online it takes my credentials and credit card details but won't log me in in the app. Great.,negative

Songs all are better. But they dont give importance to kannada songs like other language songs. So thats why i am giving 2 star,negative
Podcast still not available,positive
Hey can you add the feature to move songs up and down in a playlist trust me it gets frustrating when you cannot play your favourite songs one after other when you add new songs. The desktop version has it so why the smartphone doesn't have the feature. If you add the feature 5 stars from me.,positive
Spotify>apple music Premium is hella worth it,positive
Got great music on there but the app tends to control the user on what to listen to... Not Cool!!,neutral
Still thinking more serious about Premium..,negative
"I can't even play 3 songs without the app crashing every 10-15 minutes. It's getting really frustrating. I'm a Premium member, but it feels like I paid the subscription for Nothing🙄",negative
This makes you feel better when you are not feeling ok means when you are sad it can easily make you happy by songs. There are also sad songs but it is very satisfying app. I like it very much. After downloading this app you will be very happy. Thanks for makin this app.,positive
"Have been using this app for years, just recently it took away the option of hearing snippets of songs when making playlists, which was one of the things that made it a superior music app. If that option were to come back it would definitely be a five-star experience!",positive

"Spotify used to connect automatically to my Pioneer head unit in my truck but that functionality stopped back in February I believe. I've been holding out hope that it would be fixed but so far it hasn't. My device used to show up automatically in the Windows app regardless if i had Spotify open on my phone or not, but that stopped at the same time. Audio quality and auto-generated playlists aren't as good as other streaming services. Update: they fixed it, and then broke it again. Shame!",negative

Wonderful app for music lovers♥️,positive
The best Music Application.,positive
"I like the playlists, I like the amount of songs and artists. I absolutely HATE the free version as you basically have no control over choosing songs or playlists anymore and you get 2 songs and 4 ads. You're being forced into paying for the subscription because they make it annoying enough. I'd rather go to YouTube or Amazon music.",negative
"I have not had a problem with this app until now, It just updated about a week ago and I found that all my playlists in app were empty. And spotify made playlists were too. Nothing will play. And on the web player everything is normal. I tried this newest update, just a moment ago and nothing is fixed. Good job. 👍",negative
"Good app, but yall made a terrible decision removing the preview button. Who thought that was a good idea?? “Oh, yeah. It would be a great idea removing the preview button so others cant find new songs”💀 I cant even find new songs to add to my playlist because of that. What was the point of removing it? Add it back, please. Also, I hate how you guys add random songs to my playlist while im listening, I never asked for that. But seriously, please add the preview button back.",negative
"This app is great, the music is great although there is one problem, the app is messed up, like when I try to play the song I try to play it just shuffles to the song I don't even wanna play, it's fricking annoying and it's so annoying I wanna smash my phone so hard just because of the music I wanna play, please add ""Shuffle off"" button so I can shut this thing off, I really wanna play ""Bubble gum"" by Clario.",negative

Audio quality is exceptional,positive
Excellent Online Music Platform....... And it also needs some improvements... Overall I loved it....,positive
"Ads are fine but please, please let me choose a song",negative
"Amazing that this app has been out for almost a decade and there is still no way to organize your music library by genre. You also can't collaborate on playlist with a specific user, so get ready for bots to put random songs on your collaborative playlists. The app doesn't run well on new phones or old phones. Artists don't get compensated fairly and the CEO is a war profiteer. I'm switching to Tidal, which means I'll lose years worth of playlists, but it's definitely worth it.",negative
It's a great app for music lovers! Would recommend this.,positive
To difficult to turn app off. Considering uninstalling,neutral
"If you ain't paying for it, might as well go screw your self. It gets worse as the months go by. I only use the god awful app for 1 flipping podcast, and i have to un-reinstall 10x/podcast. Can't wait for Rogan to move platforms",negative
Why does every other app in my phone have a better audio quality than Spotify..........? And I have a premium account I often wonder if I should cancel and just get YouTube music.,negative
Organized well thought out music service,positive
Ahhhhhhhhhh I think Spotify is the best approach when it comes to listen full full album,positive
"Well, I've been using the Amazon Music app that is about ten dollars a month. Spotify is way more up my alley. Lots easier to populate your lists. Helpful suggestions. High bit rate sounds great! The thing is, I'm listening to classical music.",positive
"The new update sucks. It won't actually let me listen to my playlists anymore. I made a new playlist this morning and instead of letting me listen to it, it started playing the recommended songs and there's no way that I've been able to find to make it stop. There's also no way to turn off shuffle. It won't let you click on specific songs in your playlist anymore and the daily skips have lowered by a lot. Did I use up a free trial of premium or something? Because I did not sign up for one.",negative
New update are so trash lmao only 6 skip per hour ? This is music app or game ???? We use to listen why you don't let me chose a song that i want to listen ??,neutral
After last update there is a problem in chrome cast please fix it,positive
Busted for 2 days now. Playlist won't load.,negative
Everytime an ad comes on it dosen't make me want to get premium. It almost always makes me want to delete my account.,negative
"I don't know if y'all would answer the solution for this, but I've been utilizing this music source for nearly 2 years now, had enjoyed every single thing until the last update. Firstly, lot of songs I've played recently depicted a whole different track or album's cover, which made me hard to distinguish what song is. Secondly, specifically lastly, why do some songs have a lag, even if I've downloaded it? I've never experienced this before. Please fix this immediately.",neutral
It's a good app and has all of music I would want but when I first downloaded it I had to immediately update because the app wouldn't even open.,positive

"I'm a premium user. When playing downloaded songs offline the app will suddenly stop or crash even if the phone screen is on. This has been for a long time and i have been praying that an update will fix this. After many updates, however, the issue persist. The same issue was experienced in the phones of my wife and daughter. Please resolve this once and for all. We are paying for premium just to play our songs offline and this persisting issue is not fair to us.",negative
Basically Spotify is ruin sincr it wont even let you choose a song now it only play it for few second and then you only can skip 6 times per hour it just suck at this point 👎,negative
"I've been using Spotify for years but I can't even log in anymore. The login system is completely messed up, you could log in using your email or Facebook on the web interface as both are connected to each other. The app version doesn't work like this, it straight up denies my email. You just simply cannot use your email to log in through the app if you made the account using your Facebook. The Facebook login is also broken for months now, the page says that the embedded page is down. Fix this!",negative
It's good for playing your fave tracks for free if you don't mind the interuption of adds every so often. 👍,positive
"Usually I love this app, and I've been paying for premium for years, but this most recent update is messing everything up. The app just downright refused to work yesterday, no matter what I did.

Its an amaizing app. I love listening to music on it and i font get any adds.,positive
"Great App, but facing advertisements after every song on both my PC and my phone. Please lower the number of advertisements so that people who haven't brought premium also enjoy uninterrupted music for a limited time. For example: After an advertisement we can listen to uninterrupted music for 30 minutes or less or After ever 5 songs an advertisement will be played and after that we can listen to 5 more songs uninterrupted. Hope you take this in consideration. Thanks",neutral
It could be a great app if commercials wouldn't yell in your ear when you try to listen to some music after every 3 songs. I understand that a free version can't work as paid one but this is ridiculous and extremely annoying,negative
I was very sattisfied from spotify until it started lagging whenever it felt like it not letting me listen to music. I have contacted customer service and nothing they suggested helped the situation. This has been going on for more than 2 weeks. If it doesn't get fixed I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go with apple music.,negative

"""Local"" songs get flagged as unplayable constantly, they dropped support for Kenwood / JVC head units, it uses far more data than it has any right to, syncs terribly and requires a lot of fuffing around to do basic functions.

I haven't heard from anyone executives tech yet, it's 4/11/2020. Spotify don't care about their customers. They are only concerned with getting your money.

Making 1 star until spotify removes their own ads from podcasts. The tone shift completely ruins them.,negative
Best app using it from a long time but there's recently some issues. The song gets stops in the middle and suddenly it plays. It just hinders the joy of music. There's no issue with the network. I hope you'll consider my problem and work on it asap. Rest it's the best app for music...,positive

"Spotify is very good app to listen music. Ads are fine even though it is irritating sometimes. But lyrics are not correct for most of the Tamil songs. It's all in Romanized version and spellings and pronounciation are wrong for everything. I suggest you to give lyrics for Tamil songs in Tamil like how you give the original lyrics for other language songs. It will be more appreciated. Thank you. Otherwise, Spotify is very good app.",positive

"Pros: Great listening experience, lots of connectivity options. Very useful autogwnerated playlists, discover weekly and most listened songs throughout the last year. Cons: Could offer more quality options for pasionate users.",positive
"No other music service compares, Premium is worth every penny if not more. The people who are complaining about the free side and giving low ratings don't seem to understand the potential in this service, Spotify has made small artists around the world more accessible than ever before. They've made a service where you can blend your own music tastes with people close to you to get a custom playlist updated daily based on your common music tastes. They're bringing people together wity music. 🤘",positive
Its good but when now the daily mix is on shuffle.. please make the daily mix playlist not shuffle again : ),positive

Disgusting update. Too many advertising,negative
"Asife from the exorbitant amount of bugs (music not playing, controlling other devices only works half the time, etc.), There's several missing features like a proper shuffle (or a switch for it), themes and proper folder support (how hard can it be? It's already mostly implemented). Also, when playing a radio, the shuffle button isn't shown but it does still apply to the queue.",negative
So many ads i went to listen 1.50 minute song but i had to listen 1 minutes 9f ads what the worth gaana is better the you im shifting,negative
Ever since I stopped using premium it's been being kinda odd like the format like bro spotify u got favriotes or something 🤔,neutral

I just love this bcz Spotify have all the BTS songs that's why I love Spotify,positive

I'm able to make my own playlists, save as many songs as I like to my liked list and can skip / change songs any time I want until the next ad pops up which is completely reasonable. Used Spotify on PC, Ps4 and Mobile, which all link togther, for the best experience and to get the most out of what it has to offer.",positive
"Its worst app because add comes after 1 or 2 songs everytime they say that buy premium for no ads but i had given 2 stars bcz it have almost all songs and we can use it while using another app , please dont give too many ads do it after 30 minutes once...",negative
"The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because adding multiple songs to a playlist is slow and awkward. Aside from that, I love it.",positive
This would be a five but every time I make a play list it playes one that I want and then changes my whole Playlist to the worst music ever.. can you just let me listen to my music and not your weird music,negative

Love it best for music by far,positive
"Resuming podcast episodes is kinda broken. You'll be halfway through an episode, click play to resume, go through a few ads, and instead of resuming the episode you're on it starts playing the next episode. Every. Time.",negative
Best application for listening songs i have ever seen,positive
Very good music app,positive

Ads make no sense,positive
Yar everything ok but their are many adds,positive
I will giving three stars to spotify because it's a amazing app. Clear sound and esy to find songs.,neutral
I enjoy listening to music. This is the best music app to find.,positive
"I used to love this app, now it makes you pay for basic needs. Spotify is so money hungry you cant skip songs, and it adds other songs when youre trying to listen to a singular song. It adds songs you dont want into a playlist.",negative
Constant glitches and playback problems. You can offer me free months til the cows come home. This app is garbage.,negative
I can say this the best music app Much love Spotify,positive
"I am unable to play music its showing every playlist as "" playlist is empty"" even in explore option nothing is playing in spotify not podcast not songs its all blank",negative
Ads are more frequent,neutral
I am using a friend's family plan and getting free premium essentially.,positive
There is limited skips and you can't play the song you want just shuffle,negative
"I absolutely love it, it has everything you can really need when it comes to music. And it 100% deserves a five stars.",positive
"Really this app is too good, I like it so much. If you want to listen song according to your choice yet, this app is favorable for you. But there are some issues also while using this app.",negative
I LOVE this app so much because I love music and I love kpop,positive
Very nice sound quality is amazing,positive
W music app if you just get premium. Just get it bro it's goated.,positive
Spotify is better than ganna because it's very difficult to find songs in ganna app and spotify is very easy to use and you can find any playlist in it quickly so i suggest you to download only spotify app ☺☺☺☺,positive
Plz fix the bug. Even after disabling the automix and gapless features still the music is getting automix and is playing gapless Not expected from spotify. Will immediately shift to other apps if the problem is not solved and reverted back. Disgusting bug.,neutral
"Love spotify (if u pay for it lol) I would suggest adding an option to the sleep timer to stop at ""end of queue"" rather than time",positive
Love the playlists I can make and goes with me wherever I go.,positive
"I love everything about Spotify. Even the free version is amazing. The ability to organize the playlists, favourite songs, and just the overall presentation are perfect.",positive
"Didn't have any problem with free trial version. Until I subscribed to premium since 2 years ago and the lyrics won't show up in any device idk why. Tried reinstalling, updating, clearing cache for MONTHS. Nothing works..",positive
Awesome feature everything is good,positive
The problem is just when l play my favorite song it choose an random song is so annoying then when l search it it still put random song even l restart like what if u can fix it then fix it!,negative
I will try to play my playlist and it will automatically play random different songs that i never even added.,negative
I listened to music streaming,positive
Some songs doesn't show lyrics even though they used to show before.. please fix it,positive
"Very good, but I'd love to be able to see a Top 20 All-time most popular for every artist with the total amount of plays.",positive
Very music playlists make the app...and listen too enjoyed,negative
"It was a decent application with a lot of advertisement. Less gigabits needed for quick music listening in the background. The premium feature isn't even comparable to YouTubes version, since it is often more expensive for less content and sometimes the advertisement can longer, since you can't skip there and all ads r 30sec.",positive
"The app is saying all my Playlist are empty and won't let my listen to anything at all? Keeps saying ""try again"" and even after clicking that button it doesn't work.",negative
Bring the Settings icon back to the home screen. Why confuse android users with it being hidden in the profile section?,negative
"Really nice App, I thoroughly enjoying it, 👍",positive
"I love it. My music doesn't get put on hold for any ads, it's the best app ever. No regrets.",positive
Recent updates ruined it. 5 ads for every 3 songs,negative
"Its alright I guess. Not bad, but I would prefer YouTube music over Spotify..",positive
Every one song 2/3 adds it's irritating,negative
I don't know how one of the biggest music companies in the world can't seem to figure out how to make their app work consistently. Your app is garbage. It only works 25% of the time. I can never pick up a podcast where I left off if I'd like to switch to music for a couple hours. Sometimes I can't even get the Podcast or music to PLAY. For a company this big... This apps performance is unacceptable.,negative
I love the app but sometimes it like get me another song.,positive
I used spend hours in this app but since two days is ca causing so badly that the moment I play any song the app is automatically getting closed.,positive
Great selection of all music 🎵,positive
This app has all my favorite songs and podcast on it,positive
What happened now? I can't play my favorite songs in my playlist? How disappointing..,negative
Excellent collection. Good quality.,positive
I Really Love What I Get From Spotify And It Has The Best Music That I Would Tell People To Join Spotify,positive
As a subscriber I enjoy the wide variety of songs and music available. It's a great service.,positive
I don't mind the ads that I've grown use to. Like living near an airport; engines get annoying. But listen for the music and cancel out the rest and you'll be alright.,positive
It's good but my problem is you can't play the music that you search properly it's like you play a song you press the play button and sometimes it plays a different music and if you play your playlist you can only play it in shuffle you can't play it the way you intended to and it has ads if you really want to use it without the ads you can play music properly etc then get the premium,negative
I like new music and the old music and all other music different backgrounds thanks,positive
I love Spotify playlist and music. I always get can find something to listen to.😃,positive
Sometimes it doesn't really let me go out of i think it's werid,neutral
It's a good app for listening to music but the automatic shuffle is annoying and the songs and they added that I didn't want to my playlist,negative
Add some more advertisements so we can enjoy your advertisements without playing the songs,negative
What the heck happened to 30 minutes of ad free music??? Now we get 2 songs than some ads.... you basically NEED premium to enjoy this app now,negative
This srsly keep getting in my nerves mostly if songs different songs are playing wich arent even in my playlist!!,negative
"I don't mind the ads appearing too often, but I don't like the automatic selection of the background colors for your own playlists or profile. Sometimes it picks the right color; sometimes it's just plain gray. Perhaps there should be an option to customize our profile and playlist background colors?",positive
Terrible. Seems I can only shuffle songs at random and not listen to the playlists I want. I believe this change is new and it was a bad one. If there is some way to turn this off I still think my review would be low because it is not very intuitive.,negative
For me the app is a little irratating. Doesnt always show on my playing now. I have to close out and reopen for it fof the app to catch up when i switch from one pod cast to the next.,neutral
Gud. Why is it soo big for a music player tho?,positive
"Wonderful experience, vary easy to operate. Without distraction we can use it. Clarity is good.",positive
The app is good but it says that there will not be another ad in 30 minutes but there is an ad in like four songs.,positive
Absolutely recomend its an amazing app but one problem is the ads its alaway that same stupid add about northern kentucky unitversity damn that stupid place,positive
the apps becoming unusable the music's always stuttering and I fear years of loyalty will come to an end. I'll switch to Apple music.,negative
Great music app thats all i got to say :),positive
It's the best music app so far.,positive
"Great music, app sucks. Closes all the time. Makes you start podcast from the beginning. Freezes up often. Super liberal as well, so some things you search for aren't available.",negative
Easy listening Easy to find great music,positive
Long time user. Great app and great service! Request: please bring back the Spotify third-party extension store.,positive
"Used it a couple times but I don't like the fact you only get limited skips, and you can't choose a song whenever you want. I use YouTube music now and its way better than this app. I would rather watch a 30 second ad then not choose my favorite song. Do you agree or disagree?",negative
I can't choose the songs I want to listen to,negative
Overall a great app. I don't recommend casting to tv.,positive
It makes sound sometimes,positive
Nice selection of music and them stories U share . Thanks for the music it's easier than in 1970' seeking music.,positive
"Favorite music app, no contest.",positive
"Literally will not work at all, nothing plays, playlists give an error apon opening them, asked Spotify about it and still nothing worked, nothing works no matter how hard I try or what I do",negative
Spotify is THE BEST!,positive
"It used to be a 5 star app but, now there are too many adds consecutively. You can listen to 2 songs and then you gotta listen like 4 adds......its disgusting.",negative
"At least, let us skip it without limit. Some people are poor and can't afford to pay.",negative
"Better than Pandora, but still lacking. Recent updates make it so you can't preview songs before adding to your playlists, which is frustrating. The recommended songs in playlists are now mostly songs that are already on your playlist, super helpful. Hopefully bugs that will be fixed in 6-9 months (sarcasm, but is it?)",negative
Love that it is simple to use. Love all the choices. Now I listen to podcasts too. I'm 65 and was nervous about using but I love it!!,positive
Okay but not great there are limited skips and it also makes Playlists for you and in general its an okay music app would recommend pandora though,negative
"Pretty cool,but sometimes i ain't able to listen to all the songs",positive
Best streaming app imo!,positive
Worst experience with ads! Switching to prime music,negative
Very simple and the connection with the car es great,positive
Lovely choices on music,positive
This app is outstanding in music,positive
10/5 professional Spotify dickrider here. I come in my pants every time I open the app.,positive
My experience with Spotify is really awesome! The thing I most like about Spotify is the 'daily playlist' that really contains the songs of my choice so i don't have to do constant searching for finding songs of my taste. So for me Spotify is my daily go app for songs😊😊😊,positive
"It's good but, when i played a song it keeps on changing/shuffling i cant even play my fave song! What if the other doesnt like the other song?! i keep on playing my fave song but it keeps on SHUFFLING like what the, last time when i dowloaded this to my ipad it's not even like that when i played my fave song it's not changing. I know your app is full of music but it's too restrictring, what kind of update is that soptify?! I 'm so disapointed i did everything!",negative
You can't fully listen to songs anymore without having to pay,negative
Very entertaining and informative. All in one app. Enjoying it 👍,positive
"Too many ads, and that isn't 30 minutes, it's like ten minutes.",positive
Great app. Just that so many content creators that are just reviewing content that I am actually looking for. Bothersome.,positive
I love Spotify but I can't play music since updating my phone to the new update on my a10 e please sort this out I will change my review to 5 stars when iasue is fixed,neutral
"Please for the love of God, fix the local music player!",negative
Love the songs and app!,positive
Never had a issue. Best app for music lovers everywhere,positive
"It is to restricting please change it, I tried playing my fav songs but it keeps playing different songs and you even need to get premium? How pathetic, I'm giving this app a 1 star it's to restricting!!😠👎",negative
Below average on a consistent basis. You shouldn't have to pay for a service that has to be constantly restarted each and every time it's used. The only good thing it has going is it's variety. For an app that had millions of users it's lucky to get a rating at all.,negative
Hate the fact that i need premium to get to the songs that i want to get to why cant it be like on pc where i can select any song from my playlist i would apreciate it if you would do the same here,negative
"Love that i can find anysong that know if,but wish that there were no ads",positive
App is insanely clunky. Keep crashing on podcasts. Pauses for no reason. Just all around annoying to use.,negative
I ❤ love Spotify it helps me throughout the day,positive
"I love this app but I absolutely hate that you have limited skips, and you have to shuffle to play a playlist.",negative
Don't get me wrong I do like Spotify but what I really don't like about it is that it adds songs to your Playlist and some of the songs that they put on there are inappropriate songs that I don't want to listen to I hope this gets changed😮‍💨😔😪,negative
Love Spotify! I never have any issues! My favorite music platform!,positive
I love Spotify ❤️ my phone got disconnected and I was lost without it.,positive
Excellent service thank you Spotify,positive
Absolutely useless for uploading your music when it doesn't really track all the accounts because when I put my account name in. It's says their isn't even an account in the first place.,negative
"Zero stars really should be an option. Functions most poorly when not connected. Is it a ""streaming"" service? Some paying customers live in areas with low, slow, and unreliable coverage. Unacceptable, for a paid service. Update, still terrible.",negative
Keeps pausing randomly when I'm playing music out loud. Every few minutes! Then when I unlock my phone it starts again. 😡😡,negative
It's easy to use. An you can lesion to all your favorite bands,positive
Have used this app for years very good quality. Could use more new ways to find new music.,positive
I have the Spotify app downloaded on my galaxy watch 4. Everytime the screen times out the music pauses. Any ideas on how to fix this?,negative
Spotify thank you your #1.,positive
"I have never taken to this app. I like to own a physical version of my favourite music. Ive gone back to buying Cds. If someone hadn't sold my albums id go straight back to viynal too. Hate ""steaming""",negative
Really good quality of music better then SoundCloud,positive
Play what you want when you want. It's great,positive
"ads are out of control. Less ads, better app.",negative
"I enjoy it. Could use a few more options, like a random shuffle play of everything you've downloaded or maybe just a surprise me Playlist of random stuff. Could be interesting. I'm just happy with no commercials.",positive
Literally the only music app I can use all other ones confuse me 💀,positive
I like the Spotify app but really you have to get premium to listen to any song you want no I think that's just straight up dumb. So Spotify if you read this review can you please get rid of shuffle play at least make it optional please and I'll upgrade from two stars to four stars. Since you don't want to respond I'm going to give you one star. Fix your app can't you see by the reviews that people don't like it fix your dumb app!! Maybe I might install your app but until then you lost someone.,negative
For easy listening the app is great for me ..... a techno illiterate gal !,positive
This app is very bad because it did not give me the songs that I want and it gives me clips for songs and not full songs for example I was looking for a song and i was not answered I really do not like this app and it does not depend on it at all and there are applications much better than it but I do not want to say its names 👎👎👎,negative
Love the music and how it works ..absolutely favorite,positive
Spotify is my favorite music player. Been using Spotify for 6-7 years. Its awesome!!!,positive
"Best streaming platform 😍😍😍 Edited: after downloading the new update the app is pretty much useless now, can't pick the song you want to listen to, you are basically forced to listen to what they think you like, I'll search a song but I can't play it, it's frustrating. Uninstalled the app already.",negative
I pay for premium and can't see joe Roman's podcast. Only works on audio no video.,negative
"It has every I could want and more,and Spotify make play list that I might not have thought of. The best place for music love this app",positive
Good just less ads please.,positive
Great app but songs will get stuck and you can't move on from that track no matter what you do to troubleshoot. Spotify is aware of the issue that's been happening for quite some time but no fix in sight.,positive
Great service. Ive had other as in Pandora etc. This by far is the BEST.,positive
Buggy. Never works when I really need it to,negative
Nothing seems to be working since I updated the app about an hour ago.,negative
If you don't plan on getting premium I recommend skipping. A nightmare just trying to get a song to play without ads or premium push interruptions.,negative
Awesome app! I just wish that out of a playlist with over 50 songs I wouldn't get 2 ads every 3 songs,neutral
App is good but it's constantly cutting out when playing or just stops playing songs altogether and have to reset it every time and it's not cool when using for workout music esp when I pay for premium service I expect it to work,negative
"I love this app and I have premium, but the new update came and I can't find lyrics for any song and most of them had lyrics.",positive
Basically my paid premium subscription is okay but the shuffle option is a joke and has been for years. Every time the only way to hear different random songs from my 800 plus library is to play songs from the start. No point asking to be fixed cause obviously it's in the too hard basket. Very disappointing.,negative
I am so pleased to have Spotify to enjoy my music,positive
"Lately it's been stalling on songs. One song will play just fine and the next one won't play at all not even if I move the ""timer"" myself. I've had to Uninstall the app a few times hoping that would help.",neutral
App has continuously gotten worse and have to unistall it frequently to get it to work,negative
"New update is causing issues while reproducing music, lag",neutral
"Constantly glitching on mobile and Mac, been reading about the issues with music stopping at the 9 second mark, I can't believe I'm paying for a faulty app that doesn't work properly, yet they never have issues nor glitches when taking our money.",negative
Too many adds and you are very restricted in what you can listen to consecutively on freeplay.,positive
"Update: I swear it's like clockwork, every two weeks I have to reinstall because the app breakdown. Does anyone else have this problem? It's ridiculous and I'm getting really sick of it. (Old review) Current Version/Update: is basically unusable. It crashes constantly. I have to open and close it like 5 times before I can get it to even react to my inputs. I'm tired of reinstalling. Worst of all it's making my phone system UI crash too.",negative
Spotify constantly disconnects my bluetooth. Will not play songs. Pushs for Bluetooth. Why? Why are you pushing Bluetooth? I'm a hair away from canceling. Still no blocking capability! You're up to no goof like any other platform right now.,negative
Constant problems and the sound quality is extremely shotty for some stuff. Pairing with things can be a nightmare to get to work.,negative
Love Really easy to use this app,positive
"The music is great and overall great. But then it starts pausing music, not playing music, and crashing. Can yall please for the love of God fix these issues.",negative
Too many useless ads. Also crashes frequently.,positive
Always been pushy with ads and their ever increasing costs. Newest update butchered its ability to cast to any of my Google home devices... getting tired of paying more for ever decreasing quality of product.,neutral
"The app play keeps stopping while playing through, esp when screen shuts off, but very inconsistent all around. Really takes away from a laid back listening experience. ---- Update: last few updates (June 2020) have been doing the same thing again, but even worse. Songs will stop playing seconds after starting, have to scrub through multiple songs to get it audio to start playing again. No control over which you can play when it gets like that. Pause/play is useless",negative
"Love the clarity of the music, great selection, but for the love of whichever God you may pray to, can you stop changing the way liked songs works? I personally enjoy the selected genre option, but with it taken away it is much harder to find the songs I want in liked songs. I know Playlist exist, but I find that those are minimizing to what songs I would listen to otherwise. All around, a good app, but inconsistent.",neutral
"Music now cuts out after 10 sec, tried a fresh install clearing data and cache prior, didn't help.",negative
"The overall premise of the app is great, but there's no way to tell if your song is buffering, it just won't play. The only good part is I can download my songs so I don't have to wait for service to work, but even that can be difficult to access.",negative
"Very bad experience, not working. Ask for login when it wants without any reason. Adds no matters you have the payment version. Too difficult to find one song. Please go to YouTube and enjoy!",negative
Love it so easy even for me a 69 yo,positive
"You all have to fix your app I can't listen to half of the songs I want too, it's always glitching or messing up something is always wrong with it",neutral
The only thing really bad is the ads there's way to much,neutral
Spotify meets my needs beautifully. Thank you.,positive
For some reason won't let me play any of the songs and I pay for premium which means it comes with offline play so it shouldn't be buffering or skipping or pausing or any of that,negative
It's a little annoying that I'm paying $10 a month but there are still songs that are blocked,positive
"Completely broken for me, can listen to anything",negative
Absolutely love my Spotify premium ❤️,positive
"It is absolutely perfect for music, when it works. Lately I have been encountering a lot of glitches like the play bar at the bottom disappearing and the playback slider not working. It forces me to close and restart the app every time. The queue will also occasionally rearrange itself and sometimes makes copies of songs in queue. Once these get fixed, I will change my review.",negative
It plays a song for ten seconds then stops,neutral
"Used to be really good. Lots of issues and glitches now, it constantly disconnects between my phone and other devices. Wondering if other apps are better for the price 🤔",negative
Used to be the best music streaming service now it shoves podcasts down my throat 24/7 just pay for yt premium or apple music,negative
"I really like the app. However, the fact that you have to pay to listen to specific songs just bugs me. My parents won't pay for it, but some of the songs I like, such as Savage and Heart Attack, I have to go through playlists or find the song, put it into one of my playlists, and even then, I might not get to listen to it! So if you could change that, it would absolutely get you a 5 star rating, but until you change that, no way. Edit: Also, I agree with Gryffin Gurl",positive
Nice audio quality ❤❤❤,positive
I tried looking up artists that I listen to but it said there were no matches. So I uninstall it then re-install it and now it says that my username is incorrect? I can't log in and spotify is saying I had an issue logging in when I have the smart lock on so it has the correct password.,negative
"This app haves good quality music but the problem is when I try to press on a specific playlist it doesn't load, I restalled the app and now it won't search a song I wanna listen to please fix this.",negative
Where did the lyrics go? Newest UPDATE thru playstore removed them. WHY???,negative
I'm on my last nerve with Spotify I hope Spotify goes to hell 😍,negative
The search bar keeps telling me it can't find songs - it doesn't matter what I type into it.,neutral
"I liked it, it work with payment and without payment, well obviously is better with paying, butsize is amazing, I recommended",positive
I've been experiencing a few issues for a few months now which is annoying. Search not working entirely until app cache is cleared and restarted. Also music playing but the player not showing up.,neutral
"Long things like podcasts literally don't play anymore, no it is not my internet. Fix this now Spotify.",negative
"Great app, great music but for the last month or so I haven't been able to listen without it not working when on other apps or having my phone closed and Ive never had this problem before. The reason I originally chose Spotify was bc it works in the background but now it doesnt",neutral
"Yeah man, it's Spotify",positive
Feel great to use an app to help my favorite artist.,positive
Stop asking me to connect to Alexa devices. I don't own any,negative
if i hear one more suggested song in a playlist i made i swear i will lose my mind. Please stop i just want to listen to my favourite songs but all i hear is songs I don't know and don't like. I'm tired of using all of my skips just to skip the suggested songs,negative
"Low res covers with average sound quality... Like what are y'all storing that's so taxing on storage, y'all don't even offer lossless. why?",neutral
Why did you feel the need to limit skipping songs and not allow to go back without premium,negative
It used to be an amazing app with a few adds here and there but now there is more adds than music.,negative
"Great app all around until recently... Bugs need to be fixed, if people are paying for premium",neutral
This is so good to download it cause you can play whatever you want a song and you can post it i love it,positive
I just wanna listen to 1 song. It keeps taking me to Playlist of song that isn't what I search,negative
"Even with paying for premium and highest speed internet on EVERY device there's always buffering, pausing, freezing..... Disappointing",neutral
4 minutes of ads back to back after I paid for the premium. What's up with that?,neutral
It's a really good app to use while sleeping or when ur doing work but there are just UNLIMITED amount of ads. Like 1 song plays then there will be like 3 ads and that's just ruins the fun. Overall it's the best app to listen music!,neutral
This app sucks. I have no control on stopping or starting. Doesn't work with headphones,negative
"No ads, just my type of play. The thing I don't like is the shuffle, meaning it play a different music or song you picked. I don't like that.",positive
Good app with poor music recommendations,neutral
This app is great and all but sometimes when I click on a song I want to listen to it gives me a whole other song,positive
"Refuses to work behind a proxy. The Windows version has settings for proxies, why not the app? Spotify is the buggiest app I've ever seen. It lags on any device to load. It freezes when you change sources. It messes up Windows. 50% of the time, on a dozen new Android devices, it will grey out all downloaded songs when you have no internet. All my cars, all my running watches have no internet and I have music half the time because Spotify's bs programming. Contacted for years, no fix. Worst ever",negative
Love listening to all new and old tunes.,positive
"I listen for free and the advertising compared to other apps is far too frequent and so annoying. I feel like it is a bully tactic to get people to subscribe, which just turns me off.",negative
The app is great but for the past few days I haven't been able to listen to my music and I would like to know why,positive
The ads suck and don't even get me started You get 6 ads for an hour you At least a 100 so it's really hard To use the app I enjoyed it the 1st couple days but then ads started rolling going in and then it it sucked so yeah Just take this advice,neutral
Gave Adele a touch too much exposure. Nothing technically wrong with that. Julian Alvarez understands. Almost as good as Beppe Grillo basically.,positive
It wont let me even log in I have to change my country and whenever I click on log in with google it always says theres a problem have another go please fix it let me use the app it never works i wanna make a new account using the same email!!!,negative
I don't like how if you want to listen to a sertain song that you can't cuz it is all on shuffle.,negative
"Videos in car should be a toggle , if people feel like they can't handle video when connected to car Bluetooth let people chose. So annoying this comes and goes every other update",negative
this has to give you more freedom in phones you cant play a specific song and you cant go to the previous song instead on pc you can do all the above also i cant see why would i prefer that from a music app the only difference is that you can play songs instantly instead of having to download them also for this positive thing you there are 2 negatives ads and you have to be connected internet or just pay to have this things,negative
"Been waiting for the update with lyrics on phone for quite a while but I still don't see them even though I have Premium. I have clean uninstalled and reinstalled the newest version multiple times, logged out back in twice as suggested in forums but no luck. It works on all my friends Android devices. Desktop version shows them for me. Unfinished/broken features on paid subscriptions is a big red flag for me. Gonna drop the rating to 1 star till fixed.",positive
"Long time user and moving to another service. Playlists have become so repetitive they're useless. Like 80% of my Spotify-created playlists starts with the exact same song, every single day. And they're made up of about 80% the same songs. Offline downloads don't work half the time, so when I'm on a hike and want to listen to music I have to have a backup app with songs downloaded.",negative
Im really happy you can preview songs before you add them to a playlist again!!! like it was 3 stars without but like ahhhhhh yes. makes making playlists and discovering new music a million times easier! (i have premium btw),positive
I love Spotify! Especially for my get togethers. I make a Playlist and just let it run! I also use it for my podcast Lifeofy. My mother uses it as well and my kids for workouts and parties!!! Love how you can que songs so everyone can hear something they want!,positive
The app continues to freeze and then stop working even after an update. Please limit the amount of ads they get annoying and time consuming.,negative
Quite buggy and loads of ads,neutral
Love Spotify on every platform.,positive
"Hi, I love this app. I have it on my phone and tablet, but there's differences between them. Firstly, on my tablet, I can chose any song I want to play. On the other hand, my phone doesn't let me play a specific song, and when I'm playing my playlist, some random songs just play. Please fix this stuff that happens for free version. Not everyone wants to pay for the subscription, like me. Just make it equal because I just want to play music I like and don't get the chance because of this.",positive
"Only reason to download this app is the Joe Rogan Experience. Every time I use the app on my phone it crashes at least once. I have a brand new phone and this is the second phone it crashes on. It crashes so often my new phone even tells me the app ""frequently crashes should be put into deep sleep"". The app for TV does not play video........ why?",negative
Awesome flawless collection of music genres,positive
My Constant Music App I use this every day for my Taxi job all the time.,positive
"Awesome, Easy to use, just takes awhile to build your playlist again. Wish it had a shuffle feature(or I just haven't found it yet)",positive
Expensive! Not even competitive £10 / month,neutral
Good app easy to use 1 issue recently music streaming was stopping after 30 seconds and not starting again for at least a minute. Seems to be working fine again now.,positive
Great service! And a pretty crisp design,positive
"It's super reliable and many choices for listening throughout. Although, the have taken down many epic and amazing JRE podcasts and for that alone, they suck. Otherwise pretty great.",positive
Favorite music at ur fingertips...instantly. I love it!!!,positive
What's up with all the bugs? Music stops because of in app notifications. Most of the time the lock screen controls don't appear. Frustrating,positive
It's very easy to listen to music 🎶,positive
Thank you for bringing back the song previews. I can efficiently make my playlists again 🤗,positive

Great content terrible app. Gets stuck playing but says it's not playing so you cannot pause or play. Only way is to completely reset the app by closing it out. This happens nearly every time. Samsung S20.,negative
Sometimes the system can't handle me playing to much music and if I swipe app and come back on to try play the same song it just simply won't play! Else I do prefer it over apple music !,positive
Such a great music app and preferably my favorite!,positive
app is good but I agree with the reviews 😵‍💫 but cmon let us chose whatever song we want but with ads I prefer to listen to my music in order but atleast with ads instead of paying to chose what song I want to listen to ad free😭😭😭,positive

Awesome very user friendly 😁,positive
I think it comes down to preference but I enjoy using Spotify more than other music platforms and do recommend at least trying spotify.,positive
Honestly great app but I hate it just adds songs by itself,negative
Best app in the market. Literally everyone uses it. Very user friendly interface. Even the premium version is worth it.,positive
So good app nice sound quality💜,positive
"Broken app now. Don't know what happened but I no matter what I do, I can't play music, nothing loads or is even clickable anymore. Uninstall, update, nothing. Windows still still fine but the app is useless.. So I'm basically paying to look at names of albums I've heard recently and that's about it. I can't even search for music. Also disabling account is pretty confusing so I'm gonna get charged for something I can't use now.",negative
"It's a 100% perfect music app , but fix the bugs in searching for songs.",positive

Best music experience.,positive

Too much advertisements.,negative
"Actually this app was really great but it's new update disappoints me, I can't play my favorite songs and it's too restricting. This app makes me infuriated! 😤 And I'm gonna uninstall this right now!",negative
This app sucks big time. I got the premium and it was still loaded with ads and commercials. Its not user friendly. Honestly spotify should take their lessons from youtube,negative
The songs on playlist dont bring a list of songs,negative
"Welcome to the new era of music listening experience. The premium membership is totally worth it. I have my family included in the membership because you are able to send up to five invitations for any of your fams that want to listen to music. You are able to share each other's listening history and share each other's perspective for the Love of music. As an eclectic human being, I desire many different options, and the daily mixes that are automated for me absolutely perfectly mixed. Thank you",positive
"The app itself is great, works fine, but I don't appreciate if the premium charge bounces, when you reprocess the payment and it automatically upgrades you from premium to the next more expensive plan (like single person to two) and you cannot access billing through the app. You have to access billing through the website only.",neutral
Too much ads,negative
Fed with adds they come like 3 or 4 times in a row,positive
Best app execpt the advertisements.. Everything is good,positive
It's not a bad app although the fact that you can not choose the song you wish to listen to kinda sucks. I don't really skip nor mind the ads but I want to be able to choose what I listen to not the have it on shuffle.,positive
I pay 11.99 a month and still can't play my downloaded music offline. I can't get ahold of anyone from Spotify to help me with this problem and can't seem to find where to take my credit card off my account. This has been happening since I transfer my stuff over from my last phone. Very unsatisfied with this service!!!,negative
itd be perfect if i didnt have to pay for premium to have my music downloaded.,positive
Love this app but too much ads,positive
"your app just scammed me of R60, please see to the issue like i subscribed, i have the bank notification the app worked for a day i could download music but now why do I have to update my payment for a third time i was supposed to get a free month but y'all still took money now y'all want a third subscription in the space of one week? nah g, fix my issue or gimme a refund",negative
This good but never dawnload song 🤦,neutral
"I only use this app for podcasts. Otherwise, it's useless. It never sticks to the albums I select and often plays songs that aren't my playlists. And I hate that the desktop version only plays two songs between ads. I'm better off listening to music on YouTube. At least those ad breaks are short and skippable.",negative
It's annoying how I have to be online to be able to select my downloaded music from the latest update.,positive
"This is quite a nice music app, well developed and well thought, but I hate it that when I navigate the app offline, even if I downloaded like 800 songs, I can't play none of them. Like, that should be the perfect ideal situation the download option was created for. Even after closing and reopening the app several times, my downloaded songs won't play. So the thing is, I'm wasting around 4 gb of space for nothing. At this point it's better to get Spotify Free and not the Premium version.",neutral
"So um idk why but my phone doesn't have the play pause button at the bottom anymore and I really don't like it. Also I Can't open the song I am listening to or see it's lyrics. It also is slow when it's loading the song I searched. I really would appreciate it if you fix all these issues I have stated and also everyone else's issue please .

Great! I love seeing the lyrics and the recommend selections are SPOT on 😉,positive
"*an alright app, especially when not using premium but some issues I just don't dig;; 1. unavailability to save queue as a playlist 2. shuffle doesn't work unless you skip the song,, is when it finally shuffles 3. search should have a filter when it comes to searching for playlists (I'm new to using this app, bare with me) to have an ascending-descending option n vice versa, when it comes to likes and playtime",neutral
"The free version is not ad free, but the ads are not annoyingly frequent. Also, I know everyone worries about ""big brother,"" but I like that the ads are relevant to me. Also, there is no real competition for what they provide...",positive
This is the only app I use for music & podcasts!!!,positive
"App is Good, i just didn't liked it's widget. I would love if developers improve its widget's interface/layout, bcoz it looks so simple",positive

Why I have a s22 ultra latest update why does 💩 not work right this is going on like 6 months,negative
"I like the app but its frustrating sometimes, for example: I can't play just one song, it always shuffles to a different song even though I went to play a single, I can't seem to find my account details which restricts me from seeing what email I'm using, and lastly, it always on shuffle even though I didn't put it on shuffle.",negative

A very good app but there are some songs missing and so many ads we used to face while listening to the music I know ads are important for your business but too many ads are not good show people limited ads after 15 or 20 mins u can run ads but not after every song change,neutral
Occasional bugs. I have been a prime music user and now I really feel like I have upgraded even though I have just switched to a free service from a paid service.,positive
Used to be five stars. That was before the music that I'm listening to would skip or pause completely. After the recent update the music have been playing weirdly. Hopefully spotify sees this and corrects the app so the music will stop skipping/pausing while playing. Spotify needs to hurry up and fix this song skipping issue,positive
Awful i hear more ads and less songs,negative
"Turn it on and let it go, no talk, no ads!",positive
"I would give no stars but I need to review Do not get the premium it's awesome that you get better sound quality and unlimited skips but if you want to cancel keep doing it because they will continue to charge you ""because that's how the system works"" is what I was told by customer support I urge you not to use this service",negative
This best music player i never used before. Thank you so much created this player. I listen to music in this player.,positive
It's a wonderful app but they need data to save your music playlist,positive

All my downloaded songs are gone somehow. Now Im unable to play offline. Worst experience ever.,negative
"Bring back the feature where, when I select podcasts in my library, each show is listed in order of most recently updated and has a subtitle saying when it was updated. Knowing if an episode came out today or yesterday is useful information, most podcasts drop different types of episodes on different days. Please stop removing useful features for no apparent reason. Still buggy, every time they patch something, something else starts acting weird. Again having premium makes no difference.",negative
"Awesome, THE BEST Music App of this generation!!!",positive
I wish I could somehow see what songs I've heard before. I'm going through a 69 hour playlist and it's hard to keep track of my place in the playlist and on random setting I'll never know if I heard all the songs. Or sometimes I don't remember if I've heard a playlist or album before or just parts of it.,positive
I like the way I can find songs easily and tons of songs to chose from,positive
Still a very good app. The earliest versions of the app were superior (0.7) but I find I can do everything I want with this app. Great compatibility with corresponding apps for Spotify connect on a number of platforms.,positive

"I have Spotify premium and it has been a great experience until now. The app has begun to switch to the next song when Im only half through with the first one, skipping it on its own. It also will pause on its own and not play the next song. I thought it was a wifi problem, but these are downloaded songs. It used to let me play downloaded songs when out pf wifi range but it will no longer play them, making the download feature pointless",negative
Control player disappears. Please allow for multiple selections of titles. Samsung Fold 3,neutral
"The coustmer service is the best...they reply the mails quickly and it takes maximum 2 days for them to fix any problem within the app ....well it was 2 days for me. I enjoy the premium, and to be true i loved that they have premium for University students, and it's very cheap.",positive

Useless app literally. I tried playing the song I want but it only plays the suggested song. I don't recommend this app😑,negative

Can use it in background and easy to use,positive
I use it 6 days as week 14 hours a day this is the absolute best app hands down,positive
"Pays poorly compared to other services. Also decides to mess up when there's no internet connection, so that's fun. After all this, they increased prices in a sly way by only warning of your current subscription going up, not others. And now the app is going all wonky. If you're increasing prices, increase the quality, not lower it. Tried moving songs to SD card, had to force shut app then reinstall it.",negative
Love the app so far. Very good selections of music for all taste.,positive
"If you're always making changes, and improving, then tell us what you changed and improved. The 10,000 song limit is stupid ridiculous. Also, minus 1 more star for never telling us specifically what changes and improvements have been made. Can you at least link to a blog or something?",neutral

"I've been using Spotify for over 4 years. Premium is great, for the most part. I'm annoyed that it randomly erases my queue or, most recently, isn't even allowing me to view my queue (rebooted the app, then the phone, then uninstalled/reinstalled to see if that fixed it). Other than those annoying gaffes, I enjoy the plethora of music and podcasts available. The ability to change playback speed is phenomenal, though it would be even more awesome if that option was available for music.",positive
Opened this all first time in 3 years 5 ads back to back. I suggest another app,negative
Best music app ever !,positive
"Premium feature So I've been a Spotify user for a while now, maybe 2 or 3 years now, and decided to use premium. Highlighting the pros and cons I've come across using Spotify Premium. Pros: unlimited skips, ad free, and shuffle feature. Cons: Spotify will shuffle the music order instead in the order you choose (not sure if that's a bug), songs will randomly start playing from other playlists and the music will suddenly stop playing for no reason. So hopefully these cons get fixed.",neutral

I love this app i can easyly find any song even if i am on other acc by serching ur user you can play ur playlist,positive

Please fix the mobile network download bug... Data ain't cheap. Still 5 Star though,positive
Absolutely worst app ever. If you don't have premium like this time around i couldn't take the premium. This app will show ads right after one song or sometimes in the middle that too 2 ads 30secs each continuously. This is too much now. Can't tolerate this nonsense anymore. Better to switch to some other music app.,negative
I am enjoying listening to music which I have chosen,positive
The audio and lyrics are amazing but I just don't understand why I can't listen to a specific song and when I make a Playlist with less than 15 songs it's automatically adds songs by itself and I can't even skip properly Also my ad experience is below zero,negative
I used to love Spotify but the aggressive way it's trying to force podcasts on me and the horrendous way it makes other other artists pretend to be more well known names is bloody frustrating.,negative
"Now I've never heard music before and then someone told me to get this. I was like ""yeah right!"" First off, ""music"" can't be all that great, otherwise I would have heard it already. Second of all, how can an app have what it claims, which is music to listen to?? Well let me tell you folks! I was wrong!! Not only is music very very good and interesting, but this app has it! You can listen to it on headphone, or the phone or the computer and other ways! You gotta try this!",positive

pretty good. I just would like if you stop the ads.,positive
Its too much good for audio,positive
Spotify is good for tablet and laptop but it sucks on mobile. You cant select a single song but you have to play the entire playlist to get to your one song. Making it annoying when you just want to hear one song. Id rather use Youtube for music on my phone than spotify. They have to do something about because it really sucks a ton. I dont recommend it on the phone at all but on tablet and laptop/computer then sure.,negative
Great way to listen to all your favourite music. Whenever I drive I listen via Android Auto.,positive
"it's a good app runs smooth simple ui and I've always used the solo premium plan but recently I did the family plan with 6 profiles and it was fine for a month or so but after that it changed my plan to the solo premium again, charged me 10 instead of 16 and canceled premium on my family's devices when I didn't change anything so that was my 1st bad experience with spotify",neutral

"So basically everything is ok? But umm I really have to say that whenever I just want to play a song even I click the name but the other song pop out uhhh I'm hoping they can fix this. Because it's really to listen to a song sometimes. And even u got playlist u can't play that song it have to be followed by number. The system it self keep adding other song that I definitely didn't add, that's really disturbing",negative
Thanks for reverting the playback control buttons to their initial places.,positive

Let me tell you people I know the ads suck but if it shows you a ad just take off the app and boom no ads,positive
"Only the Ads is the only thing which is really really terrible, horrible whatever the word ypu use here, but it's true. The Premium subscription for this also seems bit expensive for an Individual.... Should have been little less expensive and much more affordable in price, So that those who loves to listen music from Spotify, don't have to find an alternative for this one. I hope they note the point, once again!! 😌🙏🏻",positive

I listen to a lot of different genres and I have about 30+ playlists, which I cannot arrange top to bottom.

"Question: I got a free version with ads. The ad will play for 30 seconds and Spotify will announce that next 30 mins are ad free. So my question is what does ad free and 30.mins means?

They disallow local (offline) storage if you not a paid user BUT they still use your phone to store ALL the songs in order to save their server data use. They WILL try to funnel you into music you don't want. If you good at structuring your music selection so to not even need skipping songs they will FORCE you out of it by LITERALLY refusing to play it after a while and instead pay random songs not in your list EVEN TOUGHT you disable the related future. The app is NOT being improved either,negative
So much ti choose from with podcasts abd music. Love it!,positive
Playing any other song but app play other song 😈,negative
Love it 😀 wayyyy better than pandora or any other music streaming services by a long shot. I haven't had any negative experiences other than when I started my spotifiy premium trial and it didn't let me listen without internet :/ overall the best streaming service on the app store. I 100% would recommend and would even argue in favor to this application.,positive

"I've had issues with it in the past but recently it started playing three commercials for every one song. I contacted customer support to see if it was some sort of error and no one even looked into it, the just suggested I try a free month of Spotify Premium to see if I'd prefer it with no commercials. I'd prefer an app that wasn't 3/1 commercials over content.",negative

But it's a very good app!",positive
"It's a great app and all, the music is good and you find what you want but the annoying thing is that when you search for a song you want to play and select it, it starts playing other songs that you did not even want to listen to and you have to wait for all thoooseeee songs to play, it's very annoying.... Please fix this, plus when you make a playlist it starts playing other songs that aren't in your playlist.... Please fix these issues, the are not making it user friendly enough",positive

This app isn't bad at all its just when you want to play a song or something it shuffles it and you have to use all of your skips in order to play the specific song,neutral
Decent on terms of info about artist but why can't I have an option to view all of an artist's music in a list? Every other music streaming app I have allows this but for Spotify your choice is either viewing albums or a small list of top songs.,negative

very greedy. can't we just skip ads? and why do we have to play a music in shuffle if you don't have premium,negative
"Bugs for months! The app is close to unusable. Unacceptable, especially for Spotify premium A podcast started playing midway through a phone call. Controls for 'currently playing' not coming up in the app. Including no sign that Spotify is playing at all. Let alone outside of it on the screen or drop down menu. Randomly stops playing music. This is a previous bug that has also been occuring in recent updates.",negative
"3 ads always, every 3 songs. this is too many ads and im not paying for Premium out of spite",neutral
"I paid and you switched my plan to individual and deleted my family's accounts. I can't even contact anyone to cancel this payment and fix it. We've had our family account for years. This is VERY unprofessional. I'm beyond livid. Update: I contacted support and there is nothing they can do. Years of our music is gone, they lied about what they were going to charge me, and changed it AFTER I hit submit, and they can't fix it. Be weary before you buy.",negative

Finally I can enjoy Spotify in Botswana. I'm loving it so so much. The endless music and of course the podcasts. Never a dull moment with Spotify.,positive
"Premium subscriber for many years, and I'm troubled by the increasing instability and new bugs. What worked perfectly for years now fails constantly even on completely different devices. For example, player control will disappear leaving you unable to control playback, then requiring you to force stop app, restart to restore control. And suggested music is far inferior to Pandora's genome. Seems that Spotify favors music that favors their own preferences than yours.",negative
I am not good with words but I will say this is a great app. would recommend,positive
Will stay the best music app forever!,positive
It is super easy to use Spotify I love it!!,positive
Learning so much and having fun in the process being inspired being in tune with so much art,positive

I like Spotify better than any of the others.,positive
It literally shuffles songs when I don't want it to and I can't even listen to the songs I want anymore And you can't even skip the ads and when I tap on the song I want it just shows a preview instead,negative
"GARBAGE! wouldn't play a single thing for longer than 2 seconds before the whole thing just went away. No ""stopped working"" notification or anything, just POOF. web player audio is all weird, gets loud for a second then quite. Whatta waste of time.",negative
This is getting worse and worse. 6 ads before you play music is ridiculous.,negative
I'm a dj and like the music updates and jamming to my Playlist in the car,positive
It's almost perfect! I wish the play next button has crossfade mixing effect too. I'd love that feature.,positive
Monthly update breaks the podcast player but doesn't allow you to to stop the podcast. The ie the dashboard for the podcast doesn't appear at the bottom. Happening again just a month later after another update. And again this app is getting worse for Samsung users.... Right on que one month later,negative
0⭐ They say that we'll be able to enjoy thirty minutes of uninterrupted music after the ad. But instead they many a times play ads 4 times within thirty minutes.,negative
Very good app nice music I like it too much nice,positive
It's a really good app I found songs I forgot about,positive
It was good first until YOU guys updated it. At first I was able to pick any song I wanted but NOW I have to use all my skips to get the song that I want (if the song is far then... You're not getting there) also there are too many ads I can't listen to a song/podcast without an ad popping up. I will be updating it back to 5 stars if you fix your stuff and make this app useful again.,negative
"The music is good and reliable, I can at least rely on spotify. Thank you DJ Ken",positive
Bestest music app to ever exist.,positive
Reference of songs is not complete,positive
Very user friendly and has all good collection of music.,positive
Whats up with all the skipping songs? There's a lot of needing to close the app then reopen because its skipping too much,negative
So good and enjoying to hear music,positive
7 ads and 3 of them being 30 seconds....,negative
Doesn't connect me to my account repeatedly asks me to make a new one terrible app,negative
No way to clear the queue except when playing specific playlists; extremely annoying. Also can't clear queue/now playing if only one song is queued.,negative
Annoying and inconsistent in its operation.,negative
For kannada songs lyrics should be in kannada..it can be useful..add kannada lyrics for all kannada songs..so many mistakes are there in English lyrics for kannada songs,positive

A lot of people on here complaining about the free version as if it's supposed to operate differently than Pandora. Honestly as a paid member I just want the app to function properly. Tired of the player not being displayed whenever I'm in or out of the app though.,neutral
Nice and easy to use,positive
Love you guys.........I am a lover of music and I can get my filled with spotify......,positive
Best music/podcast app I have experience. I have the duo from my stepbrother & myself for $12.99 & it's really great we both get premium & can duo mix out playlist together if we want.,positive
"Amazing! Spotify is and always has been my favorite app for streaming and downloading music and podcasts. The only suggestion I would make is to get ahold of more b-sides, demos and rare cuts.",positive
"I still love Spotify.. but what's up? The radio stations, my personal mixes.. they seem off. Sometimes it's just a playlist, not even radio, when I create a station?! It's just not the same. Bands that shouldn't be with the others, too much of the same band, repeating songs, different genres that don't mesh. I don't know what changed, but it makes me sad, I miss the old Spotify.",positive
Given me the opportunity to explore music more thoroughly than local radio alone,positive
Amazing but you should add some then features from Apple music,positive
"Awesome will never go back to iHeartRadio or Pandora, Spotify is the way my brother lol...",positive
Cannot stop the autoplay everytime I get in the car and my phone connects to the Bluetooth. I have to uninstall.,negative

"Question? How come Spotify isn't paying me for teaching the younger generation about music? Makes sense to me, the less music gets forgotten the better.",neutral
"This app does 1 thing that no other app does. I can pause Spotify and not play anything for 3 hours, then when I disconnect my wireless buds it starts playing the previously paused music through my phone's speaker! FFS, just stay paused. Poor app, dodgy company, don't recommend anyone to pay for Spotify, it's a joke",negative
It won't ever put the song I choose on and it puts random songs I don't like on and I have to use up my skips.,negative
"I am having issues when I cast my phone to my TV or PS5, the screen freezes on the first song I play, it's froze on that screen whether I go back to the main page or not. Cancelled my sub after a year without resolution. P.S. pay musicians more $$$ for their exploited work.",neutral
"Pay for premium but still lots of ads, what am I paying for?",neutral
Love the app BUT the notifications update is less manageable and an eye sore. Less was more. One star until it gets fixed/changed back.,positive

Premium is well worth it. I plan to use my premium account for my upcoming wedding reception and on the drive down to Florida for my honeymoon. Overall the app is pretty good. No crashing so far,positive
Spotify has not been working for weeks. My while library is gone. Then when I click on a podcast it says no internet connection but I have internet. I have even Uninstalled the app and reinstalled it still did not fix it. I have been using this app for over 5 years and never had a issue like this. This is so frustrating!!!

Best Online Music!! Try It.",positive
"This app has great sound quality and is easy to use. I enjoy it. But I don't like how you have limited skips if you're a free listener and can't pick what song to play, the entire playlist just goes. I also don't like how the playlist automatically shuffles. What if you don't want it shuffled? Other than these issues and some pretty annoying but bearable ads, the app is great and I would recommend it.",negative
"Don't get me wrong, I love Spotify, it's just.. how I customize my liked playlist and I play it like how some people do and what happens while playing it. Well what I'm trying to get at is I am not happy with how my liked playlist plays recommended songs that I have to spend all of my skips to get to a song I actually like! Thus has happened more than once and more often, it even happened today.",positive
Listen to Spotify all day every day the BEST app out there for music🥰,positive

"It's ridiculous how glitchy this app is. I've been using spotify for years and I've never had this problem before. I'm trying to listen to music but everytime I try it won't let me download or view what I have downloaded, now I tried logging out logging back in, and none of my songs are showing up and playlist I have saved from other people, have no songs in them. This app keeps getting worse and worse please find somewhere else to get your music this isn't worth the hassle. Try harder spotify.",negative
"This is worth every penny, especially when combined with my nest. It's so much better than that yt music junk app. I miss Google music, but whatever this app is awesome and pretty cheap, so I still say it's a win!",positive
Spotify free added a new feature that makes it impossible to enjoy your liked songs playlist without adding back to back random songs that aren't even in the same genre of music you typically listen to. Overall just a begging for you to spend money on premium as if they don't have millions already. So stupid.,negative
Music - 10/10 Price=8/10 Lyrics =8/10 now with lyrics but not really sincronized,positive

The App used to be great. Lately it is so ridiculously flawed I'm not even sure why I'm paying for premium anymore. To keep things short it simply doesn't function. Too must frustration for what its worth.,negative
Love how user friendly it is!,positive
"I have the premium because I'm music obsessed. I hope their pricing policy does not change. With give playlists - one of which has over 20 hours of songs - I could get billed for more than ten and change a month. So the limitless on the size of playlists is awesome, and I can look to add music at any time.",positive
Really aggravated when you're listening to classic country with family and then No Filter by ASTAR starts playing.,neutral

"Still no higher resolution music, lol. It's laughable at this point 😂 Algorithms need to go deeper into alternate band suggestions. Also song suggestions played through the algorithm needs to go deeper into alternate song selection. Spotify usually only gives you the couple of popular songs. While your algorithm is written well, it thin in it's results. Thanks",negative
Great playlists to make you dance,positive
Adds might be annoying for sleep and I don't feel like paying premium,positive
"Spotify needs to add a way to selectively move more songs at once from one playlist to another. And we need more pins for playlists, 4 aren't enough",positive
Turns off stops all the time the worst app ever,negative

I have no clue why people put bad Reviews on this app it is actually not as bad as these people describe it. There is adds but how else would they make money I mean there's not that many sooo that should not be something to be complained about. This app has a variety of songs so I think this app it amazing.,positive
the only thing i dont like is that i cant close the app and have music playing still. A habit of mine to clear out my apps.,positive
App is constantly crashing. Also constantly adds songs to my que although I turned off the song suggestion option. Make it make sense.,negative
Love how Spotify automatically connects to my car. No need to go into my phone and open the app.,positive
Too much ads are there even when Spotify showed 30min of ad free music I've seen ads.,negative
"I really like the app, I would give Spotify a 5 star rating if there weren't so many adds and premium features, on my Xbox it lets me choose what songs I want to listen to and have infinite skips. But when I'm on my phone I have to shuffle play random songs, I also don't like how Spotify adds songs to my playlist, I keep hiding them but there are more getting added every day, I would appreciate it if you guys would just have a recommendation list under the songs, but don't play them.",positive
Easy-to-use and so much music,positive
I like Spotify because it's different from the other musical apps that I have and I like the moving pictures with some of the songs ☺️,positive

"I used to use this all the time. But recently it deleted everything I had on my Playlist, and forgot who I was, and I've already tried deleting it and reinstalling it. It didn't fix it. What the hell Spotify? Why did your mobile app forget who I was but not my ps4 app version?",negative
"Earlier Spotify had 1 advertisement at a time inbetween, then it becomes 2 addvertisement at a time, now it become 3 addvertisement at a time.",positive
Add an option to clear the whole queue in one go! Takes too phone storage.,neutral
"App has become so buggy lately, it's constantly crashing/pausing my playlists and doesn't show content as ""playing"" when it is currently is so have to force close the whole app in order to stop playback. Getting frustratingly harder to put up with so might just move to another platform if it doesn't get fixed soon",negative
This app is great and easy to use i blend with BTS thanks to Spotify,positive
Would like a seek bar on android auto.,positive
I want translate lyrics feature in English 🤧 I want to listen BTS music wid English subtitles on Spotify ❤️,positive
Actually this app is so amazing i love it it gives me what i want. You guys should keep it up i love this app very nice 👌👌,positive
Why are the ads way louder than the music?? They play 3 ads between only 2 songs. The premium price is high like Netflix. You can't go through albums and add songs you have to type each individual song to add. You can only add a lot through other Playlist but not artist albums.,negative
Music on tap and music for the moment.,positive
"No option to cancel subscription, and the only other option is filling out a professional letter on why I'm cancelling my plan, which is the most unnecessary thing ever, not one company has done this before or proven to be this incompetent with its own management for subscriptions",negative
"Been a Spotify Premium member for years and wouldn't change a thing. It's the gold standard in streaming music. Quite simply, Apple Music was too late to the party and I've never felt the need to switch. Spotify gets everything right, hands down.",positive
The music quality is amazing! Music is my stress relief and Spotify makes it an easy way to feel better. I love creating new playlists (I have like wayyyyy to many lmao.) Spotify premium with no adds is also definitely worth the money! I remember when I used to have to listen to adds and it really killed the vibe. 11/10 would recommend !!!!,positive
Best way to listen to the type of music I enjoy. Fantastic.,positive
The music that mixes with my library is very good I like it 👌,positive
Very good collection of songs,positive
I dont know why there is no option to select song language in this app on Android 12,neutral
Closes randomly during podcasts. No clue why S22 galaxy,negative
"spotify is pretty amazing i'd say, but recently the new update im not sure but there's this update abt the widget colour being blue, n in my opinion it's kind of ugly, before this the widget coulour would change according to the album cover but idk what happened now its only blue, maybe its the new update but i hope to get the previous one back, it looks so much better n nicer.",neutral
"Seriously? I'm taking back 4 stars back. Heard ""Dekhu tuje ya kudrat ke najare"" even though I don't give a blink about this type of songs; heard the advertisement one week in a row repeatedly. If your ads are good I'll consider upgrading one day. Thank you.",negative
Spotify is okay but sometimes when I'm looking for an artist and want to play a full album they put me in the artist radio which plays random artists of that style difficult to determine what I want,neutral
"It doesn't work properly. Constantly shuts off middle of songs, the play bar doesnt show, fed up with it honestly. Gonna switch to a diff music streamer",negative
Shittiest app ever every time I go to a song I pick it goes to some random song I've never heard before,negative
"They killed (deprecated, as they say) support for the app to function with my Pioneer stereo, and that was the only reason to have it. Considering cancelling my paid sub and looking for something else.",negative
All the music I want whenI want it.,positive
Best music app in history ☺️,positive

The greatest music App Ever created wow!,positive
I love listening to music and listening to podcasts 😌 boywithuke long drives this is one of my favorite song's,positive
Awesome music app where you can listen to the music from your own library or suggested daily mixes and different genres.,positive
Horrible when I make a Playlist it always adds songs I don't care about or don't like,negative
"Basically, its none of the much, but it is in concerned with the privacy of users. So, I would like to point it out. ""In android there is a feature which allows users to hide all notification in screen lock. But spotify does not follow the same."" In next update make sure to get this one. Overall, app is doing great.",neutral
I just love the app and I am using it since long,positive
Why did you have to remove Driving Mode? It was perfect. Now I have to use alternatives that are not even close to what Driving Mode was.,neutral
Love that I can download the music I love!So easy to use!!!,positive
Spectacular and moving. Loved it...,positive
"Music is downloaded, still won't show songs without an Internet connection. Once is looses a connection the app needs re starting again before it'll search",negative
Very best app. Great. But reduce the ads.,positive
In the new update a feature has been deleted. Like when you want to add songs to one of your playlists you cannot play the demo part So it's impossible to add songs that have the same vibe as your playlist... I also would like a feature that you can chat with your friends on spotify and send them music...,neutral
Best app for listening songs :),positive
I wish we can download the songs and please the management should add sleep timer option in the settings no other objections but the app is very good,positive
Spotify has stopped working on my phone. It wont load at all.,negative
I pay for premium and still get ads. Ads are flaming piles of ****. £14 a month for my podcasts to be interupted by adverts.,negative
Paying for premium..can't access my download song without data fix this please,neutral

You screwed it up again with the latest version 🤬 7th June 22 : now the latest version works !!!

Crashes repeatedly. Has come to the point where it's not even worth fighting with to listen to music and podcasts.,negative
I've been using Spotify for years and it's only gotten better! Best music app!,positive
"Asks me to turn on Bluetooth, every time i start/change to the app",negative
Best streaming platform I've used soo far,positive
Works good. Good music,positive
I think Spotify is great! However we should have the option mixes if we want the clean or explicit version. It's the same song we might as well be able to choose. Because sometimes I need to choose. I also feel we should be able to peek at the next song before we skip it. We only get 6 skips an hour I don't want to use them if I don't have to.,positive
After update Spotify Start laging when we play a song it takes a second to start the song,negative
The thing I love about Spotify is if you have something you're listening to and you listen to it can you come back the next day and listen to it again I just love this app and it has every song you can think of.,positive
"THIS APP IS THE BEST! But When i make playlist, Spotify says that he put random songs in, so that's IRITATING! (pls fix that🥺)",positive
Definitely helps the work day pass much smoother,positive
"I regret every minute I had not realised there such an app, I really love it.",positive
"I don't like Spotify at first but my gf insisted on getting the premium, and I fell in love. You can download songs for offline. Skip songs. Love it.",positive
"5 stars if you have premium. By far best music and podcast service. Totally worth paying for premium, especially if you can do a Family, duo, or student plan. Without premium ads are very annoying, and you can't select songs, only shuffle playlists.",positive
I have been using Spotify for many years. It is an amazing music player I have ever seen.,positive
"how are you about to give me 3 ads, let 1 song play, THEN give me 3 MORE ads?",neutral
"This app consistently disconnects every Bluetooth device when I open it. I can use every other app and Bluetooth device without issue, yet Spotify routinely disconnects my devices upon opening. New changes to the UI make it more difficult to see artists catelogue and to select desires music. I use this app because it holds my playlists and my friends upload their content on it. Otherwise, I use YouTube and simply skip ads after 5 seconds.",negative
"It's nice, the only thing is that the ads are like 30 second long.",neutral
One of the best music app ever I see,positive
Easy to use! Great options for listening!,positive
Whatever you do don't switch plans you will get bill twice an Spotify will make it seem likes its your fault an will not credit your account.,negative
"I do love my spot. The only thing that bugs me, (NOT SPOTIFYS FAULT) is when the artists pull their music. But hey, it's their choice, their money. I have premium so I never get ads.",positive
Please can there be an option to download music for offline? Thank you,neutral
"Ads are like commercial breaks (I have had 8 ads one time) and several songs I listen to are blocked. And when I turn my phone off and listen, the music will skip like a CD.",negative
Very good app lots of content available for listening,positive
I had a good experience 😌 in listening the song it's makes me 😊 happy and relax me and one thing I Don't need to care about the screen off because when it's screen off it's playing on and it is auto shuffling 🎵🎵🎵,positive
At first it was good then this annoying update came now I can't play the song I want in my playlists and I can't skip I don't like this new update.please fix it,negative
"I don't really like how you can't listen to previews when you press the add songs button ( new update, free version) can you please change it back.",positive
please let us people who don't have premium turn off shuffle playlist,negative
Superb app very less ads i am happy 👍✌️,positive
Good music Good app no ads,positive
It's great but I only gave it four stars because you have to pay to listen to it offline and to skip unlimited songs and I understand they use it to make money I just wish it was different,positive
"If you like loud music Spotify is not for you, I have premium and I tried all the settings and equalizer and the volume doesn't compare to SoundCloud or others. Every app sounds fine in headphones except for Spotify. Volume limiting is un-American and shouldn't be allowed or what's the point of having expensive headphones?",negative
Too much add can't stop add need to buy premium package for ad free music such a pathetic experience,negative
"great, but there are adds 24/7",positive
It's really hard to find the song you want they are mixed,negative
"it's not playing the song i was clicking, kindly fix it?",negative
"Force closes too often, can't report problems because that force closes too",negative
They are giving soo much ad hardly you can listen 2 song. After 2 song ad will come,negative
Once was innovative and well-engineered application. Now it just simply stops playing for no reason.,negative
I've used spotify for awhile now and I really like it the only thing I've figured out recently was that you can no longer play a clip of the song while you are putting it on your playlist which allows you to hear the song before you add it. I honestly think you guys should but it back because maybe people would like to hear the song before adding it to their playlist because I sure do,positive
Why does a music streaming app take up 5GB of memory space when I don't even download the music,negative
Song recommendations can be better. Many songs overlap in different playlists,positive
I downloaded songs and they're not playing why I'm paying for them so I should be able to listen to all of my with on promises right the song that's not downloaded is playing come on now get right I'm paying money to listen my music from spotify I have told others people about spotify and now you're messing up come on now get it right.,neutral
"I'm not a fan of the Only 6 skips per hour thing for people like me who don't have premium lol But I like spotify, recommendations of songs are amazing too",neutral
I put my liked songs on shuffle and it plays the same 30 songs on a loop.,negative
I love this app so much i can listen to every single music in high quality. I just have a little bit problem with ads or nothing,positive
"This is the first time I have used this app, so I don't have much to report. So far I like it... I'll leave another comment about this once I use it a bit.",positive
Just deleted this app because they play songs that are not even part of the playlist which is annoying. 👎👎👎👎,negative
"It's good,, but middle middle add's problem. Please remove add's. Tq",positive
This app is very good and very comfortable to use you can also see lyrics and sound experiance is very good and there is no risk for hacking i have 6 years experience for spotify,positive

"It's a good app, but really restricting for free user.",negative
"I don't know why I can download songs, because the app doesn't work without internet and sometimes not even with it.",negative
Your irritating ads every 10 mins are not encouraging me to buy premium but rather switch to switch to some other app.,neutral
It was really a great app I can listen musics ofc its great 👍😊,positive
For some reason I can't listen to my Spotify on any of my Bluetooth devices. Really upset with this!!!! Don't know that I will continue with this app.,positive
Incredible! I love this app!,positive
"Well aside from even the non premium still being good, If you are a student, couple, family or just a single person trying to not have ads they have premium for you with special offers. Also if you don't want to pay the price they always have deals that pop up if you have been using them! I got 3 months of premium for just $1 that is insane I love it.",positive
"The control panel(where I can see which song us playing or I can pause/play a song) doesn't appear , app is not functional at all like this",negative

Better than I thought... damn! Keep the awesome work.,positive
I love it i can find diffrent kinds of songs without a problem,positive

The music app that I am most fond of.,positive
"Premium is worth it, and I'd rate this at 5 stars if they would put more effort into the Premium exclusive group sessions and make it actually work better other then that it's a good App for music and works great on Xbox and phone",positive
I'm not able to add some song in playlist 😞😞,negative
Good for music BUT TOO MANY ADS,negative
Please add a multi select feature,positive
"I cant even play the songs i want to listen, it has to be on the random playlist",negative
The app is always crashing always has trouble loading podcasts. The worst is when an add comes on and after the add is done the podcast I'm listening to skips right to the end. Total waste of time,negative
Keeps crashing and won't play my downloaded episodes without my data being on. Which defeats the purpose,negative
It's a good app ! Just needs more variety in the mixing.,positive
This app has solved lots of problems to people around the world and is also very helpful ...thus is a great and very reliable app,positive
I have to keep re downloading the app because the app freezes on a song or podcast episode which means it will carry on playing without the possibility to change to another episode.,negative

"The largest selection of music, podcasts and easy to use",positive
"PLEASE amend the shuffle feature. Based on my own many hour user experience and conversing with other users, the shuffle feature isn't a true shuffle.

I am rating this app 1 star because Spotify removed a very important feature i.e. removing the recently played. That feature was very much needed because you might accidentally play something you didn't mean to,negative
"Since my last review was deleted....long story short disgusting monetized app, since you guys make lots of money from the adds you guys put avery 2-3 songs (like 2-3 adds)....why block some futures under premium?

I love the app It is a lovely app to play music Despite the data usage to download a song the app itself is not bad. Even though in overall the best app,positive
Constantly cutting out. Since the last update this app is unuseable due to constantly cutting out every 30-40 seconds. I have other music apps on my phone that work without issue. I can't believe I'm paying a premium subscription for this rubbish. I will not be renewing.,negative
I can't see the play button and I don't want to do random and the new update sucks u need to pay to skip your songs and put they put ads I'm deleting Spotify it trash now. U can't pick the music u want. Spotify is Trashhhhhhhhh,negative

UI is back to normal now but I keep getting a premium tab even tho I already have premium. Doesnt affect anything and just returns me to where I last was but kinda weird,positive
When you have premium with no ads or recommended songs it's really good and you can listen offline and all the fun things plus you can listen to stuff on repeat which is nice. So in all this app is a great music streaming app,positive
Keeps skipping even with full 5G service. Pandora plays straight through on same signal with no problem so I know it's this app.,negative

I don't get why I can't have a single song on a playlist without having to shuffle through a bunch of others that were recommended to me. I can't even choose which one I gotta listen to. It's just shuffle until it plays. Honestly a horrible design in general.",negative
Very good app for listenind every type of music🤗🤗,positive
Most reliable streaming app which brings my favorite songs🔥🔥,positive
"Since the update Spotify won't play the next episode of a podcast, or the next song in an album or playlist. Instead, a random song plays and even after trying to go back to the playlist or podcast and physically tapping the next in queue, it plays another random song and keeps doing that until the 4th or 5th tap when it FINALLY selects the song...only to play another random song after. This is a ridiculous bug I'm paying for.",negative
Best music app cause they keep it simple Some things are worth waiting for and I love you Music. Thanx 4 Sharing.,positive

Always crashes. Worst app ever. Only have it because of Rogan,negative
So far better than streaming MP3's on your phone so much better especially for all of us poor people in this covid time of time of breaking businesses so I guess everything is free now and that as well be because people are working so hard for no reason we might as well listen to something that's peaceful.

I regret downloading this app. YouTube music is a lot better. I don't understand why I am listening to a song I'm not able to prepare fora song that I would like to play next. I have to scroll throuh My list of songs and then wait for the song to finish and then press the next song. YouTube music doesn't do this. Also I hate the exit button on this app. I have to go and manually press one of the symbols on the app for me to get out of a certain song instead of just pressing the back button,negative

Y'know what, let's hoard it away & put a bunch of ads in it so that if that person has depression or something worse & this song makes them happy, they can't listen to it! I mean, who cares what they want/do to themselves unless they're paying for premium! 😀"" Music is power & you're taking that away with this bs.

"The update is absolutely disappointing. I shuffled my ""liked songs"" and then suddenly another song which I never had heard started playing. I tried to skip it, but more random songs kept playing! From what I remember, it's just my liked songs. I never heard those songs before. Even if I try to skip all the songs, it wouldn't work because apparently we could only skip a few songs per hour, please let people listen to music in peace. Might aswell just use ytube.",negative

Best app ever super fast extremly useful and best music and podcast just about anything you can think of they got it and its completly free,positive
"1) If I search for a song, I dont want a shuffled playlist that contains that song somewhere in it. I want to listen to that song. 2) Why does changing playlists/songs instantly start another round of ads for 30min of ad free music, if I literally just got done listening to 3 ads saying I have 30min of free music? Get more accuracy and less ads on Youtube all places...",negative
Love just about everything except the 30 minute ad free feature no longer works. App is up to date and after watching an ad to get 30 minutes ad free you're lucky if you get 10 to 15 minutes before another set of ads. Without that 5 stars no problem.,positive

Outstanding on every level....Premium is well worth it,positive
It's good for music but I really don't like it when it mixes up my songs with ones that aren't on my Playlist it really makes me mad and when I can reshuffle to not listen to those songs,neutral
No matter what I do I can't make it play jre podcasts offline and even if I'm playing with an internet connection it still glitches and won't work if I pause it for more then a few seconds. It will also stop working after commercials play and sometimes randomly skip to a different podcast and lose all progress on the previous one. But I can't get jre anywhere else so I'm stuck with this garbage. Update this app still super sucks if you can find an alternative then run away from this app!,negative
Excellent at all times,positive

It's absolutely good app comparing others for listening every type of music without any trouble,positive
"A great place to catalog your music, but but everytime they update this app. They make it objectively worse. For some reason everytime they make it harder to find tour music and it infuriates me to no end",negative
"App no longer works properly for me. I can start music or a podcast but it stays on a blank home screen. Doesn't show what's currently playing at all. Also can't pause or interact in any way with toolbar. The only way to stop a song or podcast is to completely close the app. Cleared the cache and checked for updates but nothing. The last time Spotify worked properly for me was when I paid for premium, which is interesting. The only thing stopping me from deleting is that Pandora is somehow worse",negative
Ease of use. It would great if the app can remember the lat podcast I was on.,positive

Any other music app os better than this,negative
"Update: still having issues with this app working properly.

Love my Spotify Premium!,positive

I hate how there's adverts then 2 songs you can't skip. I'm sorry but I'm not buying premium either. The app use to be better. Now it's horrible,negative
"I'm fairly new to the app, but I've love listening pretty much all day long - with only breaks to charge my ear buds! I've exclusively been listening to BTS and there are some great suggestions that I hadn't heard yet. So Thanks, Spotify! I like that I can add to favorites & there's a cool feature to also skip songs (which the button is too close to the Next button, but that's cuz I shove my phone in a pocket and it's accessible from the lock screen- which is handy and not sometimes) Thank you!",neutral

Thanks for bringing back the playlist button. Now it's perfect.,positive
The app is very slow and stopped working so I contacted customer support and was passed around to 8 people who all just kept telling me to logout and login again and Uninstall then reinstall. In 5 hours 1 person actually was useful until they just asked dumb questions again. I have not been able to listen to anything since right after I was billed and when I asked for a refund it said I couldn't bc is was past 14 days but I paid on the 6th and it's the 19th so it hadn't even been 14 days.,negative

Not even going to lie I've been a hardcore Spotify listener for going on 3-4 years now and I never took the time to do a review. But check it out I recommend Spotify to anybody who likes music more than most of the people that surround them. I would vouch for Spotify to anybody on this Earth and before God admit that I have been blessed with playlists that hit the spot. Spotify something I've taken for granted a lot of times. 100% download Spotify right now!!!!,positive
Doesn't display what song I'm playing on my phone anymore..,negative

I consider my musical taste as extremely eclectic. Spotify allows me to indulge in my eclecticism. For you to appreciate what I mean check out my playlist ECLECTIC IMAGES on Spotify.,positive
Nice audio experience and with lyrics it's amazing. But you're showing too much of ads which makes it irritating to use. Showing ads are ok but you are showing it frequently. This will make the users to pissed off including me. Solve this ads issue in the next update. Three stars are fair enough to give according to me.,neutral
Very nice app once you have premium (only $10)Easy to use and always has the newest music.,positive

"On my s20 fe , the app loves to disengage activity on bluetooth with my ford sync making me have to end the app through settings with force stop. Music will play and become unchangeable in the app or from my car as well as when I disconnect (getting out of my truck) it will endlessly play on the phone until I do so. I used to love the feature of it having a widget on my lock screen and my drop down menu but for some reason it doesn't exist anymore, at least on my phone. Idk, been here since 2016",neutral
All good. It would be great if there was an overall function to have everything in 8D once headphones are plugged in. Like a GENERAL FEATURE.,positive

"Fantastic so far, one of my favourite apps!",positive
Awesome but REDUCE THE ADS,positive
"What a buggy disappointment! First, it said premium has no ads and that is wrong. I subbed for the 30 day premium promo and there are most definitely ads during Rogan's podcast that I have FF to get through. Secondly, this app is so buggy! 2 times now the video stops playing and clearing cache don't work. First time I had to uninstall and reinstall and video just went out for a second time just now. So looks like round two of uninstalling and reinstalling now! Thankfully it's a free trial.",negative

Amazing!I've got my favorite songs old and new from A-Z completed. Thanks Spotify,positive
"App has become a bloatware pos. Too many ads, too frequently, and too LONG. Not paying for this joke just to avoid your spam, and the spam has become the app. Updated: it has only gotten worse in the past year. By my estimate 1/3 of the time the app is 'playing' is now ads. Absolutely not worth wasting time on.",negative

"Bad at sticking to a soundtrack, keeps splicing other music in or just going off on tangents.

Horrible app after the newest update would not recommend!!! Downloading a different app and deleting Spotify immediately!!,negative
I find nothing wrong with the app except that it does not tell me when there are updates,positive
Loved the app before I started to get ads. I can't skip to the next song until the current song is over because a screen saying the feature is premium. I'd rather get an ad than wait. And now I can't even select a SPECIFIC song from a playlist until I play that playlist and wait for the song I want to play. It's ridiculous how after your money this app is. PC version is better so far.,neutral

"Decent. The algorithms for making daily mixes can be super repetitive, even when you try to like or move liked songs into your own playlist. There really should be a dislike button instead of a ""hide song from the playlist "" function because that song will later show up in another playlist. User interface is nice and easy to use.",negative
"Since the May 16th update, have not been able to play any music on my phone. Re installed and all my playlist are gone. Can't even search for a song, it won't play. Very upset. And her we are again with another update that did NOTHING to fix the issue. Update a month later and still not able to play any playlist. Goodbye spotify, thanks for that lovely update that took everything away.",negative
I'm very happy with Spotify. Doesn't take a lot of data storage.,positive
It's ok but the ads every 30 min without premium kind of suck and should be moved to every 40 to an hour but other than that it's very good,positive
ads are annoying ... a lot,neutral
This music app use to be better. The random song play function plays the same songs over and over. Bring the old Spotify back!!,negative
It was good but there was a lot of ads.this had a lot of songs which I really enjoyed and the ads were coming like more than one ad.,positive

Much improved over the last 2 yrs. Very good app.,positive
"Recent updates have made the list of liked songs to disappear. New songs can't be visibly added to the list. If I go under an individual song I can see that it is liked, yet no songs appear in the playlist. It is possible to activate the list through Google Assistant. Sometimes when you press play on a podcast, nothing happens, and then you ha e to restart the app to get it to work. Edit: pressing play on a new podcast no longer works at all.",positive

If you have premium this app is so cool and you can find most songs in good quality. It also recommends a lot of really good songs for me!,positive
"Absolute buggy mess. Not only does it pause whatever I'm listening to every few minutes, the play button is straight up broken. It plays when you press it, but it's impossible to pause, let alone scrub through the song or podcast. No amount of reinstalling the app or restarting my phone has been able to fix this. The exclusive content isn't worth the headache.",negative
Wonderful & Easily accessible. All songs are available in one place.,positive

"Honestly it is a nice app but why is it always adding songs to my playlists this ""we added"" is so annoying idc what you added I only want to listen to my songs and not your stupid adds also it just autoplays these added songs althought I turned it off. If this won't go away I'll just switch back to youtube music/youtube because even youtube only have double ads and you have 3 ads in a row.",neutral

I love Spotify. You can listen to any music(song) you want!!! I love it ❤️❤️❤️🎶✨,negative
I hate it now that you updated it in a negative way now I can't even play any song I want to cause it only allows me to play with premium or I'll have to wait 6hours to play another song So plz can you just put it back to normal To wher you can play as many song as you want.,negative
"I am a paying customer have been for a bit... over the last month, are crazy amount of song will not play anymore... either zero sound or will just not play.. thinking maybe it was the device I signed into a different device and sure enough same issue... it's quiet disappointing.. the app is updated. I have uninstalled and reinstalled..... and still... doesn't work.. can this be looked into... seeing as I drive for my job.. it would be nice to have this issue resolved.",neutral
"The app was good for the past 4 days but when i opened the app and try to play my fav songs,i started to wonder why it isn't playing the full song but now i i know...I had to play the shuffle songs which is kinda annoying since i only get 6 skips 👎🏻...This app really is RESTRICTING.",negative

I have been with Spotify since they begin I enjoy the music selection I enjoy the idea if I can't afford the membership at least I still got a way of listening to the music,positive
"I use this almost 100% for podcasts, even a podcast playlist which is awesome. Searching podcasts buy title or subject or topic and making customized playlists is a great feature.I do appreciate that your downloads don't take how much room and then I can use the Spotify all the time even when I'm offline. Also when I got a new phone it loaded my Spotify favorites history everything perfectly, thanks",positive
"The only issue I have is that you gotta have data to play music, other than that it's really cool",positive
I loved it but now the songs get gritchy and laggy when my screen shuts off. I have premium and my songs are downloaded. This never happened before.. starting to be very unpleasant.,neutral
Great app and all but when I play music after it's done an advertisement pops up and after then says enjoy your 30mins of no ads ... Five mins later an ad pops up and after it's done it says the same,positive
"Guys. I've been using Spotify from so many years. After updating to Android 12 with oxygen OS 12 on OnePlus 8t, the audio quality is very poor. I was listening to a post malone song before I hit restart for updating to Android 12 and after fishing the update I went back to Spotify and played the same song and it was distorting and the quality was so bad. I've tried other apps too like apple music and tidal and they don't have this issue. Please fix this or else I won't buy yearly premium again.",negative
"Very nice app but it need more song's of k-pop teams and need to remove ads ""For one's is new in this app It is a nice app",positive
Very good app. But i pay for Spotify premium and podcasts tend to run their own ads on the show. Spotify need to find a way of stopping that for premium users. Or cutting it out of our podcasts.,neutral
Good selections. Just wish there was a way to block artists you don't like.. There is a down side it stops playing after about 3 tracks and I don't know why..,neutral
"Was amazing until my phone updated. Now it doesn't do anything on mobile at all. My liked tracks just shows ""something went wrong try again"", my daily mixes and playlists are empty, search results never even show up....this is the only app that doesn't work on my phone since the update, please fix it.

"enjoying the experience, but isn't there any way we could enjoy atleast few offline songs.. nigeria le o, data dey finish sometimes.. i don't want your premium",positive
Not very good there are so many interuptions in listening,neutral
I love this app. The only problem is there no way to download songs. The whole reason I wanted a music is to listen on the road if going on long trip. But i cant listen offline. And i am not going $120 a year to listen offline! Plz fix this. This app is my favorite to navigate. Plz read this.,neutral
Edit: 06/22 any podcast with video crashes the app repeatedly. Going to cancel because this is not premium service at all. Great app when premium but latest update is freezing the app when coming back into it from background on android. Can we also bring back search in playlist to the top of the playlist? Having to go through a menu to search is less convenient.,neutral
Very fast and amazing,positive
Best music streaming platform . Hands down,positive
IIII HATE THIS APP PLEASE CLOSE THISS RIGHT NOW I CAN'T SKIP OR NEXT THE SONG AND SO MANY FREAKING ADS I HATE THIS APP 😡🤬🤬😡👍,negative
Best app for listening music we can find any song on this great app I use only this app,positive
"Notifications are not dismissed when the app is closed on Android 12. When you close the app, the static notification that allows you to navigate your current album/playlist should be dismissed. This prevents accidentally starting music via the notification, which can be VERY annoying and disruptive. And no, I shouldn't have to manually dismiss the notification every time I close Spotify. When I close an app, it should be obvious that I don't want to use that app anymore.",negative
What the hell happened to Spotify? With the new update you can't even play a playlist. It plays in a random order. You click on a song in the playlist it plays a preview from a random spot in the song. What the hell is this apple music? And listening to music on here is like Pandora now. It plays stations instead of the actual song. You can't even rewind anymore. What the hell spotify?!,negative

Bro it's about commercials So many commercials More than YouTube and very long commercials It's make me piss me off,negative
This is because Spotify keeps forcefully adding songs to my playlist that I don't want and limits my skips to 6 even though I don't want those songs . Please remove your recommendations as they aren't needed. Thank you,negative
"Today, one of my family members on premium family which was already in use, stopped working. Whe i logged in, that family member was gone from the list of members. Now i cant add any new mebers either. The link does not work. Also, i cannot log a support request, there are only pre-defined problems listed, which does not have my problem listed. I cannot get my problem resolved, so i will cancel my subscription tomorrow.",negative
Yeah it's fine when it works properly shame that's a rare occasion,negative
It won't support mobile payment. even there is enough balance + taxes needed,neutral
Simply outstanding collection of song,positive
I rate this a 1 because I want to listen to the music even after I'm on another site but what it does is it plays for a little bit and then automatically stops and the tab in the notification bar disappears it has not happened once but multiple times!!,negative

This app is the best app to listen music 🎶 But we cant listen music ofline This is a very bad fault .we need to pay to listen songs ofline.,neutral
Useless waste of money. I downloaded this app specifically for podcasts and the obvious bias throughout the company made sure I won't be using this company again. There are major issues with programs from a specific side of the spectrum and it's becoming more and more obvious. If you're a bigot then this is the app for you,negative
It is best app to hear music.,positive

"I've been using a 6GB RAM phone. But sometime Spotify takes a lot of time to load a song. I update the app as soon as I see update notification. I'm a premium user. I love Spotify, It's my only source of music. It's an amazing app. But if just Spotify resolve this issue, it would be 5 stars.",positive
It is a very amazing app wich makes it possible to listen to all of your favorite songs with out having problems,positive
I have been using many music aps in the past 10 years or so... I find Spotify the best one in terms of functanality and ease of use... Still few improvements required like usage in poor network areas... Need to fix that,positive
This app is really amazing to listening a song 😃,positive

It keeps playing suggested songs even when i turned it off this app is so bad,negative
Unbelievable but super I like very much I impressed thanks lot,positive
The app is just perfect.,positive
"Used to be incredible, but the so called enhancements have made it almost unusable. Playback suddenly stops without warning, the app crashes repeatedly and its now impossible to refresh playing from liked songs or playlists. I really hope this gets fixed otherwise I'll have to look at alternatives.",negative
"As a music app definitely serves its purpose, great algorithm on preference and I love the offline play. Main reason I subscribe, you get a discount if you pay for full year which most music apps don't offer. Only draw back, doesn't offer details on tracks eg production date, producers, and also no mixed content",positive
"Please, how do I turn the shuffle off? Is annoying. I don't need the shuffle thing",neutral
It's too complicated to understand,negative
High quality songs and lyrics,positive
Ita good but the ads are annoying and long,positive
I was going to give you 5 Stars but In Spotify it would play one song and then starts playing like 3 to 5 Ads that are 30secs each and then it won't play the song that was going to play pls fix that.,positive
Kindly remove shuffle option from my Spotify I hate it very bad,positive
"Needs more sorting options. So easy to add, why not?",positive
-1 star due to excessive number of ads,positive
"Ads every 5 minutes, just like old school Doordarshan. 😂 So I finally paid for Premium. It has the best collection of songs across many applications I've used.",positive
"Very good music app, I recommend to everyone who enjoys good music",positive
It's a great app but I don't like how u add songs to playlists and sometimes I don't like the songs so that's why I gave 4 stars but apart from that it's an amazing app with different types of songs!,positive
Got the new update and now the app is trash. Never works right. Just freezes up and it's a waste of money. Would like a refund for my subscription,negative
love this app totally but the ads r just so weird n irritating,positive
"Personally, the latest update is one of the strangest updates ever in history of bad updates ever in companies. How are you gonna force non-premium users to use shuffle all the time? That's stupid. I don't want to have to listen to multiple other songs that don't even go with the song I'm trying to play. they ruined playlists with this update. c o p o r a t e g r e e d",negative
Having trouble finding a couple of albums otherwise great how do you like my playlist,positive
There does not need to be an ad after every 3 songs ok. Also only 6 skips per hour is annoying,neutral

Best app for songs,positive

As in I have set the sleep timer set and I wake up with a podcast playing. It's an amazing app when it works well but I can't go a day after this update without a frustrating bug. The last updates yielded bugs once a week, what did you guys do with the last update that makes the app terrible?",neutral
I don't want they added song and extra song in my fav songs and actually in my playlist they so many added and i have 2 song in that playlist I love the songs but when i press the song will be other bc of ur added i wish spotify see this and remove that and pls if i play the song will play until the end of the song not u just press and song a bit and done,negative
I love Spotify!! I feel like it's very diverse with its music but sometimes the ads just get a annoying sometimes,positive
"It frequently crashes, they don't want you to listen, but only subscribe with payment. Annoying popups and adverts. They pay artists almost nothing. And they invest in the terminators that will one day kill us all.",negative
Solid app. Only thing is the shuffle play on all liked songs tends to stay on the same 100. You can fix that by letting it play overnight on linear (alphabetical) so it stops picking up on your listening patterns and fav songs. Other than that I'm happy. Had it for around 5-6 years now,positive
I use this app evey day the only downside is the ads,positive
Adverts a lot less intrusive than other platforms,positive
"Needs to give you an option to ditch podcasts - or any content someone might not be interested in. I don't need a good portion of the app showing me things I'll never use. I also find navigation more difficult than necessary. Digging into an artist, album, genre, easily finding last played songs, all opaque and cumbersome to accomplish.",neutral
the app is amazing but m i not getting the lyrics in my app..updated it a several times !!!,neutral
"No advert, easy to find a song",positive
"Even after upgrading to premium, I'm unable to use Canvas feature... There's no such option as ""Canvas"" in the setting. Please solve this issue, one of my friend is also facing the same in Android version. Feels like Spotify doesn't give a f about us and only taking care of iPhone users.",negative
"There is no option to find the hidden songs. I am not talking about "" show unplayable songs "" option . There is no spesific location or an option to find the songs if you do not remember the playlist or the song ! Rather than that this is a very much entertaining app ❤️👌",positive
After update not working why?,positive
Sound quality is great...,positive
"Love this app, easy to use, best for music",positive
When I hear my favorite music it makes me calm Nice app,positive
This app is a piece of junk the only thing it's good for is listening to songs on your Xbox One or computer literally it will play songs that aren't even in your playlist when you're on your phone it is literally like forcing you to get premium this app is trash on your phone but pretty good on every other platform.,negative

There is to many ads and you can't play the specific song you want EVEN AFTER WE'RE FORCED TO WATCH ADS! if we're forced to watch an ad Spotify can play the song I search for or pay us to watch your ads #PayThePeople #BoycottSpotify,negative

I've only had this app for a little while but so far I really love it. I am able to hook up with my Bluetooth speaker and take it with me from room to room while I'm cleaning and it doesn't disturb my husband while he is watching T.V. I am not very good with technology and this app is very easy to use.,positive
"For what it's worth, I love it. But you will never find another app that you get a month free premium for $9.99 unless we're talking about Pandora (looking at you). Spotify is awesome cos they have their own family plan and each playlist is always curated to you",positive

Excellent quality off sound and music genres.,positive
STILL the best music app I have ever had!,positive
"My god, if you are to use any version use the computer version, this will add random songs to your playlist, and give you limited skips so you can't go through them. The ads they also give you are so much more annoying, you cant even close the tab they open, and the only way to avoid these things is pay for premium Would not recommend to anyone, use the computer version if you really want spotify, this is a blatant cash grab.",negative

It's good I love it but when I add songs to a playlist it randomly adds some songs. If you could make that stop thanks but if you can't sorry for wasting your time.,positive
"Wonky with sd card, no easy way to manage downloads or see how many songs you have downloaded, no good way to true shuffle through all your songs",neutral
"Spotify is not that great without the premium or paying real money for benefits. You can't pick a specific song you want to play and you cannot play a certain song over again. You can't even play a playlist in order. All you can do is shuffle a playlist and hope you hear the song you want. This is really dissapointing for a music app. I'm hoping to find a better one; and you all should too! If you really want to use Spotify, pay for premium because it is terrible without it.",negative
I love the app. Been using it for many years,positive
Easy and useful,positive
Way too many ads compared to the amount of songs you listen. Good app apart from that though,neutral
Incredible app but the group sessions work better before when you could scan to connect.,positive
"Buggy. Put a podcast into a playlist. Download pod. Play playlist. Remove pod from playlist and from downloads. Play playlist and the ""removed"" pod still plays. Also keeps saying there is no internet when every other app on my phone connects fine. I have regularly encountered this problem for years on 3 different phones.",negative
I was stuck on pandora for a while but I am glad I switched love it,positive
"I used to love this app because I could choose which songs that I wanted to listen to in my playlist. Now, I'm forced to listen to them all just to get to the song I want to hear. You have ruined this app Spotify, congratulations, now, I will never use this app again.",negative
"Great app, just wish would allow a like or dislike on recommended songs so the same ones don't keep reappearing.",positive
I already mentioned the incorrect names of some songs or the timing they are being played at..too fast or too slow but no one has made the proper corrections or even acknowledge my inputs,positive
"Started using Spotify as a student at a discount and now done studying, still use everyday🥳 Spotify makes my morning routine so much better with great music and suggestions. Thank you Spotify 🥰",positive
I love Spotify I recommend it to anyone,positive
Way better then xm. And I can always deal with ads at a free price,positive
I liked the songs tht r playing thts y i gave it a 4 nd not 5 bcuz it has 2 much ads which i dont like playin in between while i am listening 2 my favourite tunes,positive
"Excellent app,no crashing and it will play our song from where we had stopped recently",positive
Just amazing .prefect for every occasion,positive
Trash always cuts out every couple of minutes been with them for years but will be cancelled shortly unless it's fixed asap.,negative
We were on vacation with no TV and you saved the week.,positive
Spotify is the best for podcasts & Music like when I work out. I use Spotify and I will never use any other music service,positive
Spotify and only spotify for me!,positive
the best way to listen to music. reccomends songs for me so i can find music i wouldnt have been able to find otherwise. also makes it extremely easy to share playlists with others,positive
"Good, although whats with the downloaded playlists not working when youre offline, so whats the point in downloading them??",neutral
Some good old and not too old music. Nice blend of world music.,positive
Spotify is a great music app. I've discovered a lot of really amazing artists on the platform. The reason why I'm giving it a 4 star is because I've been trying to subscribe to premium with my Samsung phone but I can't seem to select a payment method. Is there anywhere I can resolve this?,positive
"Smooth, has what I want and doesn't cost too much. By far my favorite music app. However, it would be nice to join the rest of the world with Hifi quality. I have to pay for Tidal on the side to get the most out of my system.",positive
I like it but it does not play the song on your liked songs even if you do shuffle,neutral
"The app keeps crashing, keeps stopping and pausing for no apparent reason. I have this app for one exclusive podcast, and the cost-benefit ratio between enjoyment and frustration is tipping very seriously in the wrong direction.",negative
Well sometimes you want lyrics on every song it is not that way always,positive
Great selection and great music.,positive
"Spotify is a very good App, has archive of genre",positive
Playlists are being rearranged at the speed of light- this is clearly a bug and reinstalling did not work to fix it,negative
I dont want half an hour of ads for 1 song you are a joke and this is why people will continue to find ways around your joke of an app,negative
Can find good music on here,positive
Spotify is a great app you get to listen to your different songs it got a lot of songs around the world your favorite songs too get it 😍,positive
Fantastic app I've never searched for a song that couldn't be found Spotify has everything I've ever looked for and then some love not having the commercials and a big library of songs never ending wonderful entertainment,positive
"Music quality, volume normalization, playlists, and ease and versatility of streaming on different devices are all great. Group sessions could use work. Music recommendations aren't as advanced as Spotify wants you to think - nothing will top early-Pandora's Music Genome Project. Most spotify-built playlists are worded vaguely as to what they actually are, and podcasts are shoved in your face throughout the app. Finally, 'offline mode' is straight B.S. It requires an Internet connection.",positive
Cool now that I can finally see the lyrics (I bought premium so I can't complain about anything),positive
Doesn't work half the time and have to clear cache and force stop all the time,neutral
It's great if you have the premium subscription. Lyrics came back!!,positive
"If I want to play a specific song, it plays the whole playlist, which i find extremely annoying and it only let's me skip six songs an hour, so I'm stuck with the same playlistof songs even though i wanted tailored songs",negative
"Sometimes during search for new it takes so much time.,",positive
Only app worth writing a review for. Almost perfect. Now provide a visualizer for Playstation and Xbox...please.,positive
My all time favorite source of music. I've I've using Spotify since it came out and I'll never use anything else. 😊,positive
Lyrics don't let you click them to skip to that part of the song. Only a problem on mobile. Also own uploads can't be synced across devices.,positive
"I wish I could give it no star but you can't. The new update is stupid I can't skip songs the way I want .I can only skip 6 times in an hour 🤦🏿, Just bring back the old version.",negative
Learning to love it! ❤,positive
Its ok put up with the comershals and is good free,positive
You can get your stars back when my I'm no longer logged out of my fitbit every 10 seconds,negative
The BEST music app EVER!!!!,positive
you dont have to pay to listen to music. also i cant listen to songs while offline and internet isnt always accessible,negative
"Won't play the song I request, just keeps playing random music.",negative
"Wonderful, ideology ads a bit much",positive
"Deleted my old review and am replacing it with this one. Anyway. Want a consistent music app that works reliably? Look elsewhere. UI can't stay consistent and performance is always hit or miss. Don't know who, or what, group of people are running the show over at Spotify, but jesus christ, they need to go. Only reason I still use the app is because it has just about any genre and band I could ask for. If it weren't for that, I would have ditched it long ago.",negative
Love the freedom of having any music I want any time I love Spotify thank you,positive
Group session is not working properly,negative
"I have had it for about two weeks now and it's good, so far. Listening to a lot of Phil Collins and DMX. Yes, I like both!",positive
Have had Spotify for a few years now and I'm not going back to anything else.,positive
I love Spotify everything you want and more,positive
Absolute rubbish. It adds rubbish to your playlist and doesn't actually play any of your music.,negative
Everything I need in a music app.,positive
"3-4 ads after every 1 song, 2 songs if you're lucky. Songs spontaneously stop playing. Never thought I'd go back to Pandora, but I probably will. This app has become garbage.",negative
"It's a great app!but can you please add,, 03 by SHMEKERA"" please it's my favorite song.",positive
I enjoy using Spotify.,positive
"For some reason, when I open Spotify it tells me that I'm offline, when I have wifi and my other apps are working, or if It does work, I don't hear any sound when songs play. please help me fix this!!",positive
Premium is simply the best way to go. Affordable and being able to download your playlists are absolutely fantastic. Great quality of life if your service is spotty,positive
"It was amazing a few weeks in, (unpaid) when I could play any song I wanted. A few later, still unpaid, I had no control. It shuffles my playlists, and I would've liked that since all my songs are good. It was an immediate uninstall when random 'recommended' songs appeared. Shuffling into a song I've never heard is unacceptable.",negative
Music none stop all day everyday paying worth every dollar and coin.,positive
Unbelievable what you get for free. My fav app,positive
"I ABSOLUTLEY LOVED THIS, it had all my favorite sooongs, and I found ppl with my same interests in musiiiic- Spotify is my life man.",positive
It's gotta be the best app that I've have ever used thus far. Thank you to all the people who make this station a reality. Sincerely. M.Foss,positive
"Spotify has stopped playing on my mobile device and keeps telling me no internet connection, despite having a good internet service. I hope it is rectified as I am already losing interest in the app.",negative
It is better on a PC or laptop than a mobile phone on mobile phone you can't skip more than 6 times per hour or listen to a specific song you searched if your gonna use it use it on a laptop,negative
Very good App we listen every artist songs,positive
This app is good to listen to music,positive
Love it! Has all the music & podcasts I need,positive
Great music selections in any genre.,positive

Its a good app for misic so i do recomend for school and otger puppese.,positive
I cannot click on the song I want to listen to. A few days ago it allowed me to now the only way I can listen is to play all and skip through which is odd. Please fix this issue,negative
"Probably the best music app that exist. Me Personally, I think this is The Best Music App ever. My OPINION.~~",positive
Love the app. The only thing that bothers me is the new playlist system that was implemented. I can't play the songs in my playlist without it being mixed up with other songs that weren't added to the playlist. Now I usually open Spotify on my laptop because it doesn't have the annoying feature.,positive
"I love the app and just how free to be yourself it is, but I use premium because there were so many adds even during ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"". Also lately songs are being taken off for whatever reason",positive
"If I tell it to play the music out of my watch, it instead just goes to the Bluetooth screen and won't let me play it. Fix this bug or this app is unusable",negative
Garbage dont instal this waste of time and storage,negative
"Excellent catalogue of music, in any genre thought of.",positive
"Buggy and unreliable. E.g. sometimes I start Sonos music, return to the app not long after and it has no idea music is playing, so hard to stop it. A Sonos speaker that is always on the network sometimes appears in Spotify and sometimes does not (the Sonos app has no problem). Connecting to Sonos speakers is painfully slow. Often I open the app and tap one of the recently accessed items at the top of the home page and just as my finger touches it, it all moves around. And that ugly app icon...",negative
"Unlimited Curated Playlist ability, artist information and fun to have similar artist recommendations made from my taste in music. I learn about new music from Spotify.",positive
The app is not working from the time of update. i am unable to login hope that is sorted so that I can listen to songs like always...,positive
"Very restricting. It makes me wanna pay for premium, but I don't want to. If u don't have premium there's alot u cannot do. It is not enjoyable, it's frustrating, it makes me feel forced to pay for premium not like before there's no ""6 skips per hour"" and before u can play your liked songs in whole version. Before it was all good I've used this for a year and half now, but I'll stop now cuz it's very restricting.",negative
"legend has it this is the best streaming app, but i think the legend kinda lied 💀",positive
Ihave enjoyed this app but i think u need to make an option to download a song,positive
I just wish that there were less ads for someone looking for continuous music for stars.,positive
"They seem to want to force you to go Premium? It appears that once you start a track of songs, you cannot remove the notifications and auto starting of the next song(s). Sometimes I just want to listen to a few songs and not the entire track. I haven't found that possible. So while the quality is good, the freedom of choice isn't. Uninstalling....",negative
I want to say that it's a very good app but I am not satisfied with the ads 😕. When I am listening a song i am in a mood and the ads spoil my mood😑😑,positive
"I can relief from the stress and problems by listening to these beautiful songs.,THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS.",positive
"I've had Spotify for a long time and it has been overall the best music app I've ever had. I would have hands down given this app 5 stars, but I'm upset with the new update. It used to have a scroll on the side but no longer has it in the new update. I have 1500+ liked songs in my Library, and I now have to scroll through 1000 songs just to get to one song I wanna listen to. Sure, I can search in my Library, but then it won't auto play all my music. -Edit- The scroll is back! 5 stars!",positive
Too much of ads song by ad song by ad 😠 how to i lesion the songs,negative
Pretty good experience when you have premium,positive
"Great selection and application. There were issues with the android auto earlier, but they have been fixed",positive
"I've been listening to Spotify for a few years now. The look has changed, l like lt. I can find the songs that I like. And change them when I like.",positive
Great to be able to create own Playlist from 1000 of choices,positive
"No video on Web OS. Spotify has one of the worst apps - constant glitches, and now I can only listen to it on my TV? No thank you - that's why people prefer youtube...",negative
I like following Luke Bryan and they send him my way just as if i mentioned other country western singers. Luke is my favorite and his songs lite up my space!,positive
Awesome music application. Fought using it over Panora for years then was forced to do to getting a Samsung watch. Love the fact that you can pick your songs. Way to go Spotify! I'm a believer 😌,positive
"I hate this app because y'all add songs to my playlists,and I can't pick what song I want to listen to because y'all randomize it.",negative
Recommended by a stranger once and has been a good app to use,positive
Very*1000 nice having lots of best song,positive
App is constantly playing music for no reason. Requires a force stop and then the app will play music again lol. Easiest unistall of my life. Use YouTube music its way better,negative
So many problems. Songs don't play keep pausing or stopping want a refund for the last month,negative
Best music listening app 10000000/10,positive
Search history or playlist not saved,neutral
it has a lot of the songs i like but there are some that aren't available (mostly anime openings and endings) but overall its great except the ads that play consecutively like 5 times in a row,positive
Best app for songs of every artist lover,positive
Great app. Appears to have most of the music I like. The only difficulty I've experienced is downloading so I can listen offline. Any tips?,positive
literally the most frustrating and irritating app ive ever used. the free version is rubbish and gets on my nerves.,negative
Such a nice app yeah sometimes I can't found a few song bt its ok and everything is perfect love to listen it n 1 of my most fab app✌🏻😇,positive
"Am I the only one having poor audio quality on Spotify. I have tried loud, and chosen the highest audio quality too",negative
"Have downloaded music for when I have no service or wifi as my work requires me to be in dead zones a lot. Sadly even though it's downloaded and essentially in offline mode. I still can't use any of my downloaded music cause the app itself refuses to load. Used to not be like this but past few months to a year it has been. Let alone shuffle just shutting off or the app just doing what it feels like doing. Fix the issues. Enough apps take ""bug reports"" but do nothing. Don't be like those apps.",negative
Easy to navigate and has all my favourite music,positive
"Nice app, But it contains too much ads.",neutral
Great music app..... lots of choice. Only listen occassionally so I don't use premium but still enjoy the control over the music and the choice. Having to listen to some commercials is absolutely fine.,positive

It's an app that is easy to use and convenient for listening to your favorite songs!,positive
Has all the music I listen to! Quality is good too.,positive
Can't listen to my music it always pause when it plays,negative
What's the point of being able to download music if it's just going to delete my downloaded music the day after and force me to go back online after if I want to listen to my downloaded music? Stick to Apple Music or Tidal. Spotify doesn't care for it's users.,negative
"This app is tiring now, every playlist I make it skips song to kabza de small album I don't want to listen to. STOP IT",negative
"this app is a really great music app , however whenever i make a playlist they always put in songs that they'll think I'll like to my playlist, and its a great thing to some people but it gets tiring hearing songs that i didnt put into my playlist, its sort of annoying. But other than that the app is great.",positive
Pls fix Spotify. Its keep on crash while i listen to songs before this are not like this.,positive
Audio is very clear and Spotify has a large selection of music.,positive
It is an exceptional music app as it covers most of the songs,positive

"Great app, however I do not know my password to log in on my other devices.",positive
"I can't even pick the song that I want to play, I can't even skip the songs I don't even know or like. I downloaded this since I thought it would be like hte PC version, well it is worse.",negative
Only but a big reason for 3 stars. I've been using for nearly 2 years and I loved it but for the past few days I've been having trouble with 'searching' songs and I thought to reinstall thinking it might work but the worst part is I can't even sign in or log in now... I miss it... It would be so kind if I can get it back. Thank you,neutral
"I really do enjoy the amount of music this app has, but I have gotten 8 ads in a row once. Would rate higher If they would chill out on the ads. You can have some but spending more time listening to ads than the music is unacceptable.",neutral
This is the very good app and I am use 2 hours in a day and this is the one and only music app and the high quality music and the enjoy the non stop music in whole day buy the Spotify premium and enjoy the next update,positive
Incredible use and selection. Multiple devices and really great service highly recommended.,positive
"Get rid of the "" Hidden"" button. I accidentally hit the button but I could not find an option to bring the song back. Thank God, I was able to figure out the name of the song to add back to my Playlist.",positive
"It's a good app, I've been using Spotify for a while and the only problem I have with this app is that when ever I'm listening to music, it will crash and I will have to listen to the song I was already playing. That's the only major problem I have with Spotify.",positive
"Spotify gave me the opportunity to make my first ""play list"" ever! I love it!",positive
Only Ads some songs,positive
"Without premium listening is hell, also it adds songs to your playlist that you don't want.",negative

"Have the premium service and I can pick the song, the artist, or the genre of music anywhere, anytime I like with no ads or interruptions. Unlimited skips if something doesn't fit my groove. Play straight through an album, a Playlist, or go random through liked songs. Even voice commands with Google and integration with Waze are a breeze. Two thumbs up 👍 👍",positive
Hands down best music streaming App Nothing else comes close. I've experimented with other platforms but nothing compares. When my friends tell me that they don't use Spotify I tell them that they're absolutely crazy. The podcast options are the best too. Joe Rogan's podcast is by far the best podcasts out there in Spotify is the place to get it. I am known to be a negative person but I have nothing negative to say about Spotify except for making me use 500 words to write this review. Holler?!!,positive
"Spotify has the best selection of music with an easy to use plattform ,there always updating there criteria so your more likely to find music youve been unable to track down on other plattforns its definantly my go music app for all my listioning needs",positive

Ads!Ads!Ads annoying me,negative
5 ads is the usual number I have to listen to that is why the app is losing users,negative
I dont mean to be rude but spotify need to get their act together. The problem with Spotify is that it loves to undownload tracks whenever i go for a walk while its in offline mode and its inexcusable and really frustrating. Spotify team please fix this problem,negative
I love but it gets really glitchy.,positive
"The free version of this application is garbage, many artists have gone up and said the amount of money they make off of Spotify isn't a livable amount. (the distribution of how much they pay is the cause of this). Another thing is the first party bot accounts to try to take even more money from the artists. The limited amount skips shouldn't exist with a lack of pay. Another thing is the mid tier UI, the massive amount of advertisements, and non premium quality even with Spotify premium.",negative
"It's got everything i've searched for and suggestions, Excellent!",positive
"Easy to use, great selection and they recommend good music to my preference.",positive
I'm confused why it doesn't play my custom playlist on the right order and sometimes it plays music that wasn't even on my playlist.,negative

Don't know what happened but app extremely buggy lately,negative
"Never likes any streaming apps, they were BS and gave no real advantages. But I could not live without spotify. Often when my playlist ends, auto play similar songs works so well, that I find new songs I like and don't even notice that playlist ended half hour ago 😅 also, app itself is really good, like it a lot, I can download songs to play offline.",positive
It's the best music platform I have ever seen even you can listen the song in your playlist even tho when your one day data plan is over and that also kpop pop and many more that you keep in your playlist I love this but the thing is that I am facing some problem to set ringtone with it but it's ok,positive

I'm extremely grateful that Spotify manages to support 'even my'spesiific tastes for the earliest vocal music from the 10th century through to the exceptional violin & cello music of the 15th through to the 19th & 20th century ! - It takes all sorts !,positive

To much ads. But the app is best. 3 stars because of ads.,neutral
"After a while, my account was unable to be edited and my username appeared as random letters and numbers. Whenever I tried to play a song, it would play a 30 second ad and then do the ""You'll get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" thing. But even though the ad was over, the timer was still counting up. I couldn't do anything on the app and all of my playlists had been removed, as well as my search history. 🙃",negative
Shuffle is broken. If the songs are in the same order everytime...it's not random is it? Currently paying for Premium.,negative

"The app is tremendously great. The features and everything is convenient ranging from category of music, lyrics of the songs, and etc. The only thing that I find odd is the volume of the songs. They play somehow quiet in the Normal volume range. I suggest that you try to make it louder at that. The lyrics also should be downloaded offline also in case you want to sing but do not have available WiFi connection. That is all. The app is wonderful. But some adjustments would be fine.",positive
"Love everything, so easy to navigate and I always find my favorite songs 👌🏿",positive
Obviously Spotify is 1 of the greatest platforms to listen & enjoy music & the same was for me until Spotify started idk what happened but whenever i open Spotify it just doesn't have any of my liked songs & like there is nothing there & when I try to put on a song by searching it.. it just doesn't play & i feel that they should do something about it . I uninstalled and installed the app 8-10 times and it works only once after i do that. I hope if any1 is having the same problem please reply.,neutral

When I initially downloaded app it was just like the tablet but now it has become frustrating & unusable because I cannot choice the tracks or songs easily. It's no longer track or song orientated but album orientated & I cannot select the tracks I want but instead get given random tracks.

This is amazing music app after installing this application I never think about other applications.,positive

Every time I get a new notification the bloody app is sitting open on top of my notifications. I've gone through all settings, but seems this app just wants to be in constant use. Over rides other media apps that I have playing in car and sometimes plays simultaneously to other apps. Seriously annoying. Am considering cancelling my subscription",negative
"Great app👍 Constructive feedback: desperately needs a function for changing playback speed (American ""authors"" often speak so slowly, with long pauses between words, that their podcast can become tedious) Edit: Still bright blue adverts for bat-flu info in the app, it has come and gone already - Im sick of hearing about it.

Premium is awesome and never bugs out 🤞,positive
"Spotify was always my go to app when it comes to listening to music. I've had premium for a while but am not able to afford it anymore, wich wasn't really that bug of a problem before but now with the new update it's almost impossible to use for free. Like, making being able to listen to songs basically only for premium users?? C'mon, it's not like spotify doesn't have enough money. Don't stoop so low",negative

This very.. nice app.. for music.. and podcast.. And their are many artists.. you make own playlist.. 🙂🙂🙂,positive
The last update was fine because you had a chance to play your songs in order or not. on the phone I'm not a fan of the new update I can't even play my songs in order it's only playing shuffle when I try to listen for a new song so it goes to a different song,neutral
"I wish I could rate this app more but that's definitely not happening. My experience with this app has been nightmarish considering all I wanted to do was listen to music. First, this app is about music, right? Well, in my case, the music DID NOT EVEN PLAY. It would show it was playing, but it wouldn't make any sound. I can assure you this had nothing to do with my device volume. As for the playlists, THEY NEVER EVEN LOADED. This does not have anything to do with WiFi, either.",negative
The best app with music & radio !!! Congrats !!!,positive
Can't wait to listen to ads before the songs 🥰,negative
"Please remove the ""smart"" shuffle to be honest it's not smart it's dumb when I click the song I want to listen it gives me a song don't want no wonder why people think SoundCloud is better your app will fail if you keep this up",negative

The song recommendations are good but the only issue is that at times when I have my earphones connected to my phone it would randomly start playing some song like that's really annoying if u could fix that then I'll rate it 5 stars and the ads are really annoying,positive
Very nice but Dont Advertasment,positive
"I can't get the app to play a playlist. I choose a playlist, shuffle and it plays one song before randomly playing songs that aren't on my playlist. It also defaults to one song when I stop listening. A year later from the above review, and the app intermittently stops playing my downloaded music. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the problem persists.",negative
This app is really amazing and I would recommend you to try it,positive
Video playback doesn't always restart without a full app closure,negative
It's as if I'm hearing the music at a live show and gazing gayly upon the bands I love so much.,positive
Nice app because of listening music all the time 😃,positive
"very good app, but if no membership you can't play the song you want to play",positive
Pretty good app overall can be a little slow sometimes like when I'm in the car it takes a while for songs to load when there downloaded and u have to have internet to look at the lyrics even if the song is down loaded 😆 lol,positive
I love every genre of music that Spotify offers,positive
"Okay. Spotify often doesn't give me what I search for, and when it ""does"", it often doesn't give me what it said it would. The next tracks are similar, but not from the same artist. YouTube sticks to one artist mostly, but introduces you to knew people too, so that's better. YouTube gives you what/who you searched for. Spotify plays in the background, so that's better than YouTube or TY Music. YouTube 2 Spotify 1. YT Music is basically a poor man's version of YouTube, so no point there.",positive
This has just become trash spotify before was better it doesnt shuffle and had no ads and it had unlimited skips unlike now the owners want money cause they think everyone can afford premium while. Other people just wants to listen to music youtube music is better than spotify my opinion but people probably hate spotify too cause of the shuffle and ads,negative
Love this app but the ads are irritating and can't listen to my fav song offline,positive
"Its very informative that Joe Rogan chose Spotify as their main residency for their podcast. In my own experience, Spotify is the worst app I've ever used. Everytime I have to use it I despise. It keeps crashing. I use a s21 ultra phone There is no reason I should have so many issues with this all alone.. Of jre did not switch, I wouldn't usr Spotify at all. Spotify. Just improve your UI and stop sucking",negative

Expect ads everything is good,positive
Many ads irritating,negative
I hate Spotify because with out premium u can only skip a couple times and when u search a specific song u hardly get that one without listening to other music and if u make a Playlist they add random songs and they usually suck,negative
Pretty much only amazing if you buy a membership but reasonable price for a great product,positive
It's never letting me play my licked songs or my playlists anymore SCAM,negative
"Spotify has given me the opportunity to listen to my fav podcast, MORBID!! I love it!!!!!!",positive
Liked it a lot . It is easy to use the app and also can be played with slow internet access. Only problem is ads but overall that's the best app among all the music playing apps. Thanks Spotify Team for it.,positive
Unless you pay for premium membership you get to listen to 2 songs then a load of adverts. The shuffle feature plays a small selection from your playlist of about 5 songs. This has improved slightly over the past month but still not great. The 30 minutes uninterrupted that you occasionally get isn't 30 minutes and on occasion has only played 3 or 4 songs. Sometimes you play a song then it just stops for no reason at all which is frustrating. I'm fast loosing faith in the ability of spotify.,negative
Please add a feature where I can shuffle all my playlists! I will give you 5 stars❤,positive
You cant go into your playlist and play songs in order like you could before now you HAVE to litaen to it shuffled,negative
Not only is it expensive it doesn't work and goes down intermittently more and more I am honestly thinking of canceling and going to a different service,negative
App does not give me the song I want is extremely difficult to use rather opt for deezer,negative
"Excellent , not too much adds",positive

"After uninstalled for months I am reinstalling this app . The previous reason for unistallation was , There were issues like we can't hear we want instead of it we have to went through playlists which we usually don't like and also '' THERE WAS NO FREEDOM OF HEARING "".

EVERYTHING you could possibly need to enjoy ANY music from anywhere! !,positive
I've had Spotify since 2014 and I used to love it but now I get all the same music over and over there's never anything new or that I enjoy. The app NEVER suggests actual new music within your specific niche. I'm seriously tired of listening to the same songs and artist over and over. They should sincerely consider whatever algorithm YouTube has going on because this sucks.,negative
No way to see all songs by an artist. I don't deal in albums so i have no clue where one song is in 20 albums. Wont be payong for premium again.,negative
"Am really enjoying myself with the app, is really a moving truck",positive
Best music app compared to all other apps,positive
Please increase the audio quality.,positive
"id prefer it if we had the option to search overall for a song in a folder in the library tab, but other than that i enjoy using spotify",positive

Thanks to you Spotify..,positive
"Auto recommended music , sounds quality sharp , bass just perfect to go along with all song.",positive
Selection of song is very easy Enjoying,positive
App sucks. It pauses when my phone screen goes off. Phone screen needs to stay on in order to keep music playing. Even the downloaded music and in offline mode. And even though I've allowed Spotify to run in the background. What is up with this ???????????????? So annoying and frustrating !!!!! 😫😫😫🙄,negative
How can you guys okay with your app..I can neither log into nor make a new account...how inappropriate. I've been trying from so long but it all gone waste. I can't enter in your app. It keep saying something went wrong. I don't know what is wrong on creating a new ID. Just something you guys.,negative

I recommend even the free version is worth it. Trust me, you won't regret subscribing to Spotify.",positive
I like this but I kind of have a little bit of Doubt but I like this app because you could still listen to your music even though you turn your phone off and your off of the app you can still listen to the music so I like Spotify,positive
Wonderful there are literally all the songs in the world,positive

Spotify is #1 in the world 🌍.,positive
This is worst...it shows too many ads..although it shows that after one ad there won't be any ads for the next 30 minutes but if you close the app and reopen it...it will again show you ads..just here to criticize it for being so greedy for earning money by showing ads..whereas ....its primary function is to let us listen song peacefully rather it ruin our mood sometimes by showing irrelevant ads..this app literally forces you to buy their subscription,negative
They do like music and stuff.,positive
"EVERYTIME I LOOK UP A SONG IT WILL NOT PLAY. THIS IS THE WORST APP. IT PLAYS EVERY SONG BUT THE SONG I CLICK ON. Please update and fix the problem. It has worked perfectly until now. AND SAVE YOUR MONEY, DONT PAY THE SUBSCRIPTION.",negative

Way too many adds,positive
I wish they can make it to where you can play a specific song by itself without playing extra songs,negative
"GET THE EXTRA BUTTONS OFF MY SCREEN! They cover the information to the content I'm interested in! WHY? For nearly 10 years the Spotify community has been begging for an explicit only filter. If you look at Spotify's own reasoning for having explicit content in the first place it's ""to present the song the way the artist intended."" Yet they daily force edited versions into my content. And right above where I'm typing this it says that Spotify is always changing. Just not for the better huh?",negative

Never thought I would be saying this but I'm switching to SoundCloud, SCREW YOU SPOTIFY!!!",negative
It has all kinds of great music that I like to listen to,positive
"Wow... this app is totally amazing 🍷, love it❤️ , keep up the the good work spotify 👍🏽",positive
Its amazing usually but lately i go on spotify and go to library and all my music is gone same with my playlists are empty,negative
Please add an option to shuffle all Playlists. How is it 2023 and we still can't do it?,negative
"Don't download it, not worth it. I'll stick to it until i find something else to listen my music on, they are ruining the free version to rush users into buying premium, basically removing free services just so you buy premium. Maybe if people left even more bad reviews, they might think twice and see what they're doing wrong.",negative
Love this app. Totally worth paying for premium,positive
What happened to the podcasts? I used to be able to select one and it would take me to the last episode I listened to. Now it just starts at the top and I have to scroll through 300 episodes to get to the one I was on. Not cool.,negative
I love listening to my favorite songs playing in the background. I love this app that is why it deserves 5 star rating.,positive
I can't play MY PLAYLIST without playing a raido with songs I've NEVER heard before,negative
"Wish it wasn't so limited in available bands\songs, but the app itself and it's features work great.",positive
"I'm using this app for many years now and it has become one of my most used services ever. Nothing gets close to Spotify's convinience and ease of use. I couldn't live without it anymore. I espacially love the huge library of music. No other service gets close to that. And the discoverability of new music on Spotify is unmatched, too. But pls, work on the following! Pls, -fix Spotify rewind (didn't run on my old device) -release spotify HIFI in the EU! (I need high res badly) Thank you! :)",positive
"Spotify is always my go to for music. Update June 13 killed the speed. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it but it now takes 20+ seconds to skip or respond to any action. I hope that gets fixed soon or I'll have to shop elsewhere. Too bad, because I use it a few hours a day",neutral
I hate the amount of skips you have only 6 for every hour plus it plays songs that aren't on your playlist like fix that it gets in my nerves but overall it's a good app it's just those dumb things they need to fix,negative
I really like how it has so many choices for songs. There are many different artistes too.,positive
So far so good. Still limited by only getting to choose one music genre/ style unless you make a playlist. I want the freedom to choose as many styles/genre's and be able to listen to music my way especially when I am paying for it. Has a large selection of music but is also missing a large selection.,neutral
Amazing 👏 recommend this app with the premium feature,positive
Don't like Spotify adding random tracks to my lists,neutral
"Plss fix your app, it's hard to use, what the heck, all the songs and playlists shuffled play I can't even play the song I want because it's shuffled even though a song isn't included in the album There are also many ads Plss fix it 😢btw I'm not angry I just asked for a little request on spotify🥺",negative
It was nice hear how the new/suggested songs sounded like but now I don't have that small preview and it's really annoying,neutral
Really bad when I search up a song I di find it but it takes me through a whole Playlist and I can't skip. However when I do find the song I want I can't put it on repeat I remeber back them you could. Spotify explain,negative
Veri slow to load up and move thru.,negative
"I love it, spotify is amazing!",positive
THIS IS TOO BROKEN IF I CLICK THE SONG I WANT THEN WHERES THE PLAY BUTTON!? AND IT CAN CHANGE SONG WHEN IM TOUCHING THE PLAY BUTTON THIS APP IS BROKEN,negative
Lyrics are not loading most of the time! Please fix this!,negative
Really didn't want to use a app on my phone for music my son talked me into it he said the even have music for us fossils so yes its brilliant definitely recommend this app👍🇬🇧,positive
"It is been terrible for the past couple of weeks I can not access the app when my network data is on and data is actively working. I have used different network data but still have the same problem. It is really frustrating, fix it thanks",negative
"It's significant for me, I highly recommend him ... But if there are some updates on widgets, It will be more great for me 🤩🤩",positive
Updated it now playing on other devices is a problem. I can't consistently connect to my laptop. Previously I could but now it's a problem. Updat is trash,neutral
By far the Best music app love it! Still #1! Every update gets better!,positive
Great love that I can make my own Playlist easy to do for a senior person who loves old and new artists. THANKS.,positive
Great but the radio is terrible. They just play the same songs over and over. They will play the same songs from the album you just listened to as soon as radio kicks in... lame.,positive
Still trying to get it to play more than one song without restarting.,positive
I loaded up Picked up a bunch of Groups Within 5 minutes I was up and running Certainly not like the other app,positive
Terrible in app experience. No playlist selection can make up for the UI.,negative
Kind of sucks how it's only in shuffle but at the same time I think it's a good thing because you don't have to decide what plays next.,positive
"Love the app and the ease, but the thing that lets it down most is the integration with Google Assisstant. Asking it to play one track and you get a completely different one. I don't know which end has the issue but it definitely causes a lot of headaches.",neutral
It's a good app i can listen what i want hehe,positive
Great as long as you can cough up 10 bucks a month,positive
App is good but now sharing in snap chat is glitchy plz fix it 😊,neutral
Good app but needs to have early 2000s remixes and Indi pop songs,positive
Good starts up as soon as I get in my vehicle and very easy to switch to different albums.,positive
Its amazing! But not ALL sorts and forms of songs are available mostly the ones with top views are there not more...also stupid ads,neutral
"Best music app you can download! Has every single song/artist you like listening to, different mixes depending on your mood, and podcasts to listen to if you're not in a music mood! If I could I would give this app 10 stars, that's how amazing it is!",positive
Ok it's fine just 1 thing. Stop adding random songs to playlist just based on my music taste that I can't remove. Its annoying. I dont want them there.,positive
"Most annoying app ever. forces you to listen to complete songs from artist you do not like. Saying slow down, you only get six skips per hour. I can understand happen to watch a commercial but to make me listen to a complete song before I can move on?",negative
Spotify is wonderful. Premium is worth it. (Edit) Group session very rarely works and it would be great if you guys could work on that and fix any bugs. It's one of my favorite things about Spotify.,positive
"One of the best music app,to listen and discover new music.great selection and quality plus very user friendly.",positive
"Spotify please stop putting suggested songs I don't want to listen to in my playlist we only get 6 skips & no I don't want premium I just want to listen to the songs I put in my playlist in peace & now to add on to this the preview songs is no longer available making it hard useless trying to discover new songs/music, it's aggravating .",negative
First 1 weaks very nice but 2 weaks app was log bug not change next song not use Burton's very many bugs very bad experience 😡😡😡😡😡,negative
Love it best music app,positive
"Wish it would work right.. doesn't show controls (or anything) in notification bar like other apps. constant updates, never see any changes but you better update cause it'll steadily glitch if you don't. Itll lose my place or just suddenly end a podcast early.. Kinda sucks all around. This will probably get deleted like my last review",negative
This is one of the worst apps I am forced to use. I loved Spotify and was happy to pay the $12 a month but for that I feel like I should get an app that works. One that opens and doesn't freeze every 5 seconds. It's been months now and Spotify does this thing where it doesn't show It's playing at least twice a day and the only way to fix it is to restart my phone. You should expect to lose a lot of customers over this. Update: it's even worse and doesn't play sound when it shows it's playing,negative
Hard as hell to set up and when ever I use Bluetooth the sound automatically goes to quiet and there's no way to fix it,negative
"9 ads just to listen music, you're gonna listen to more ads than actual music.",negative
services are soo slow its my 8mb connection and it is taking almost 10 secs to play any song why ?,negative
"We’re always making changes and improvements to Spotify. To make sure you don’t miss a thing, just keep your Updates turned on.",positive
"It is impossible to shuffle play all downloaded tracks. People have been asking for this simple, highly useful feature for years. Before that it was actually possible. Apparently the folks at Spotify have never been on a road trip through the mountains or on a flight with no internet connection. In the forums, their answer is to build a playlist; this answer is condescending and unhelpful.",negative
"Love Spotify. Gives ads, you can pay for Spotify premium tho, which is great for listening offline.",positive
Just the most amazing musical experience in and beyond the multiverse! In a nano second of time you create what used to take me months and months and months to do. God! I wish I had this tech 25 years ago! Spot-on Spotify Spot-on.,positive
"I've been using the free version and I loved this app for 2 years, but recently the ads have gotten so annoying. 1-2 ads is okay every 4-5 songs but I have gotten at least 2 ads in a row after EVERY SINGLE song and I even got 6, 30-second long ads in a row today! They also removed the preview version, so now struggle to find new songs.",neutral
Love it always manage to find what I like to listen to,positive
"Recently I can only listen to 3 or 4 songs before the skipping starts and the music quality is unbearably bad. Contacted support 3 times, they didn't even engage in trying to fix it, just no interactions in the chats the last 2 times. Will likely cancel subscription if I can't get someone to try and address this over the weekend.",negative
"Garbage - only plays songs NOT in my playlists, even with every conceivable setting to prevent it.",negative
Very few glitches Works 99% of the time Too expensive but best option,positive
"Without premium you only get six skips an hour. It won't let me manually change songs, so when I am on a song that I don't wanna listen to and I'm out of Skips I have to deal with it or pay for premium. This problem is only on phone. On my tablet it's the perfect music app. Unfortunately I can't play any music on it without Wi-Fi on my tablet. Spotify sucks without premium. You're already getting money from ads. Do you really need to charge me to enjoy your app?",negative
It has a nice variety of music and podcasts but it very often stops working so I have to Uninstall then reinstall the app to get it to work again.,neutral
"Used spotify for YEARS! love the platform and will be a user for life! The yearly wrap ups of all your top songs is great and lots of Playlist variety! You can find almost any song you want, even soundtracks. 5 stars!!!",positive
Love listening to music I want to hear.,positive
Love Spotify.... I have used it for years!!!!,positive
Listening to music without any break!🎧❤️,positive
It is really good I have made about 50 Playlist and even I'd you don't get premium you have to deal with some ads and come on a fue ads won't kill you it's better then most games nut anyway anyhow Spotify Is really good,positive
I can't listen to my music and I have to pay with is unfair and recommend do not download. I always have to listen to other music they recommend but they all suck. It's better to just hear music on youtube,negative
Much loud ads after every song,neutral
I can't play the song itself I have to listen to the entire Playlist and even when i make my own Playlist it adds its own songs,negative
"It's an awesome app, you can play it outside of the app even if you're device is off. But Spotify does everything in it's power to keep non-premium users from having cool features. It's really dumb to have limited skips and your playlist doesn't play in order on mobile and you can't loop your songs unless you're premium other then that it's pretty good but just a few premium features that should be regular.",positive
Making it different from other's is Podcast.... Love the app,positive
The new update is very bad.I can just hear a few seconds of my songs in my playlist,negative
Most recent update has completely bricked the app on mobile for some reason. Please fix.,negative
Has just about everything u can think of and easy to use,positive
Best music streaming app ever,positive
I like the app but I don't like that you have 6 skips per hour because I don't like sitting through a song that I don't like. knowing I can't skip it,positive
I think this company is very sneaky when you want to cancel something they make it very hard you know I guess they just want you to keep paying for a service that you don't use anymore so they make it difficult for you to find where the cancel be wary of these kind of companies cuz the only thing they care about is milking you for every penny you have and when a time to get rid of these apps they make it hard,negative
"So awesome getting music, podcasts all easily available 😀",positive
I can find most songs. I had to reload the app not to long ago. No phone support kinda sucks,positive
Love the free music and library,positive
I like it a lot. I pay for premium so no adds. I don't make playlists or do anything fancy. I put an album on and let it play then I pick another. I like that the app shows new music from artists you like. You have to click follow on the artist but it's no biggie. Plus it shows support for that artist. I like that it will show you concerts coming up from your followed artists. All that said for how I use it it is five stars.,positive
It is good with or without paying for premium,positive
Too many ds!! It's not a music app but an ads app now!,positive
I am unable to login again !!!! Worst app i have ever used to login 🤬🤬,negative
Experiencing issues while searching for a song sometimes. It shows no internet connection even if i am connected to one. This is very annoying. Fix this,negative
its a good app when im in a bad mood,positive
I use Spotify for everything but I am quite disappointed not angry it's a bit disappointed that you have to get premium to skip as much as you want and I'm also not big fan when you type in the song you have to go through like a whole playlist then you get your song like once I typed in the song and I had to wait like an hour till I could actually get the song that Iwanted,positive
"Really tired of the glitches on Spotify over the last few years. Sincerely thinking of switching services. Have to consistently Force Stop and reboot app so that user controls (ability to pause) show back up. Also despise the fact that it boots automatically when linked to my car...annoying if I am not expecting it AND it should be optional, not automatic.",neutral
Pretty much has turned into the same handful of overplayed songs and ads.,negative
THE BEST APP I CAN'T AFFORD PREMIUM BUT STILL ITS THE AMAZINGEST APP HOLE UNIVERSE,positive
"I love Spotify, but the latest layout change is too much. WHY CHANGE SONETHING THAT WAS PERFECT? AHHHH!!! Don't make me use YouTubeMusic, I might like it more.",positive
Its great but not a five star because it will control your volume if you put the volum low it will ture it louder,neutral
Great music. Easy to use and many artist to listen to as well,positive
I don't have premium doesn't mean you can add ad's after every 2-3 songs ...it sucks ...please fix it.. Overall app is good but this is the only problem that is irritating.. Edit -- It's getting worse ...seriously ...there so many Ad's ...it shows that get 30 minutes of ad free music but after 10-15 min ...an ad pops up ...and sometimes there are 2-3 ads too...,negative
For some reason this app is now trying to open all of my personal audio without my permission and there is no option to stop it. It is not my default audio player and I can not open it any other way. Horrible.,negative
App is grt but pls add feature to see wot frens are listening to like pc,positive
Spotify the best,positive
No problem with my music list. Everything plays and no problem with loading the songs,positive
"The slowest app on my phone, by a large margin. Have tried signing in and out, uninstalling and reinstalling, turning phone on and off, clearing cache and data, everything. This app doesn't run, it saunters with a cane. Also, no way to disable annoying podcasts...NO I WONT LISTEN TO BRO JOGAN",negative

"Beautiful app,thank you!",positive
"The app keeps randomly stopping in the middle of listening. It also won't register what I'm listening to while I'm in it, so I can't skip songs or anything else. It would be great if this issue could be fixed. I have found a ton of good Playlists and podcasts I enjoy, this is just a real pain.",positive
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE APP BRUH ???? I stopped using for a while and now I just came back and everything is lagging to extreme cases to a blank screen altogether ... Probably will go with YouTube music ... What a disappointment ...,negative
Love the discover weekly and how easy it is to share music and playlists with friends.,positive
Just freeze on the splash screen on my one plus 7t,negative
"I honestly don't care what people say about Spotify, I mean a lot of people now hate Spotify and rather listen to songs on YouTube instead. It's most likely because you have to skip songs just to listen to the song that you want, but like if you hate or don't like Spotify than you're just something else (impatient is what you are) any have a good day and don't go on TIKTOK. I'll leave a 5 star review on TIKTOK check bit out.",positive
Best music app I have used the best thing is you can down load podcasts to listen offline. I recommend listening to scared to death,positive
Can't control the enhanced list. When sharing a session on same network with other users can create IP conflict if the host session finishes,negative
It was good for 1 Yr but recently spotify keeps saying no internet is available.. though ny internet connection is good in other apps.. I have reinstalled the app. Connected a different internet.. cleared clache.. but still it says no internet available.. kindly fix this problem,negative

Good but so buggy. Constantly stops working or does weird things. I like what the app offers but it's annoying to use.,neutral
HORRIBLE I cloud not play one song by its self I tried playing this one single song but it was playlist that had the song in it that I wanted to play so I tired skipping to the part I want but its says I can only do 6 skips which is a dum set up your forced to listen to songs you dont like until u get to the song you want so I tired doing a playlist with only songs I like but then spotify decided that it should add a buch of songs I dont like so then there you are waiting for the song u want.,negative
Love ❤ the way the music is selected.,positive
"The new update were you can only skip 6 times,it's not nice and is really annoying",negative
Worst support... contact support many times all the time they won't solve the issue and tell this is something our customer support can't resolve,negative
"For a music lover, like me there is nothing better than this...",positive
"Absolutely terrible on mobile. I can never use the mobile version because of how stupidly unbearable it is. How come PC version has unlimited skips AND can play any song in the playlist and mobile can't? And why can't i just make a playlist without other reccommended songs being randomly added and i can't get rid of them? Literally the worst music app, i swear. I can't even play just ONE single song wothout having to play a whole playlist just to get to it. I dont know how people can use this.",negative
Bestt app ever... But I would love some changes such as bring the three dot option in search results only so we can add them in queue if we want secondly please add features to make playlist collobrative through app and also to re arrange songs.

"Update 6/17: Still very glitchy and very frustrating. If I pause a song/podcast and then try to open the app to play again it does a forced closing of the app. App has been very glitchy lately. Not showing a play bar, having trouble starting songs or podcasts. Also wish it would save your spot in a Playlist when you bounce around to listen to different things. It saves my spot in a podcast but would be nice if it did the same in music Playlist (such as New Music Friday or Discover Weekly).",neutral

Botched everything up recently. Please make it better or back to how it was.,negative
"We should have the option to remove Podcast recommendations from our profile. I don't listen to podcasts, I don't care about any of them on here. I also shouldn't have to reselect the ""Playlists"" tab from the My Library section every time I navigate to it. Let's bring some actual customization instead of more ""suggestions"".",neutral
It great but I just don't know how to play music from the new update because if I press the song I wanna play it just plays a part of it if someone could tell me how to play a song I'd be glad,positive
I'm giving one star ⭐ because the application giving advertising even one song. Before some time the application not give advertising even one song so please fix This ads.,negative
...Spotify is my favorite Music App!!...love making my own playlists!!...,positive
Great app for streaming music,positive
It makes no sense that you can connect to Bluetooth headphones to listen but not too your smart watch to listen without a premium subscription,negative
You broke it. This last update causes the app to crash constantly. Unusable.,negative
"Spotify is a great app, however it has a few hiccups. 1, it's ads for the free version. The ads are a nightmare, instead of 1 or 2 every 30 minutes. It's 3 or 4 every 15 minutes. 2, downloaded songs have a little downloaded emblem in the playlist. It disappears sometimes and having a 100+ song playlist is a lot of storage space. With all of that, Spotify is a good app. Premium is almost required but it's only 9.99 a month. I love the podcast selection they have too. There's something for anyone!",positive
"The app keeps freezing, shuffle automatically comes on even after clearing my cache and daily mixes will change part way in to the first song compared to what songs were initially shown.",negative
"Why is it when I search for a song, and find it, I can't just play it. Instead I have to shuffle and play a playlist that it's in - get a grip Spotify, I won't renew my premium until this issue is resolved",negative
I love it but the only thing holding me back from giving this a 5 star is the car UI now being a premium option.,positive
Nice app.but when I try to play a song that's In a Playlist all the songs come up and I can't hear the song that I chose.i will rate this a 4.5 out if 5.,positive
Always recommended but you always need a strong internet to play songs .,positive
Full of adds,negative
This app is amazing. We can hear any type of songs we want. And the best thing I like that there are lyrics also available. Just love this app 😍 ❤️ 💖🎵🎵🎵,positive
"Awesome! Thank you so much for such a wonderful app, i can listen any music and podcast i want. Thank you developer for free, you have a big heart.",positive
Great for finding music I missed or had forgotten,positive
The only thing that keeps this app going is the fact that it uses less battery than YouTube and Apple music isn't available to Android users. You can't even rewind a song without hearing 3 ads. Then they tell you that you have 30 minutes of ad free music. That lasts until you click a song. Or for about 10 minutes. What the hell happened to this app??,negative
"It doesnt let me play the song i want , it just shuffles to a diffrent sobg please change this.",negative
Best audio quality The music app ever I seen,positive
"I like the app, but I don't like that it is always stuck downloading songs in the background and gets stuck until I open Spotify. Idk if it's clever marketing to get the user to open the app, or if it's a bug...either way it is very annoying and has forced me to consider canceling my premium after years of being a subscriber to Hulu/Spotify. I'm sure no one reads these reviews after reading a few of the others. Shame on you spotify",negative
Stop adding music we didn't even add,negative
Good flow of enriching songs,positive
Very neat. Really good UI and very enjoyable,positive
"What the fk is happening? Occasionally pauses, sometimes turn the volume up without any contact with my phone, that lies comfortably in my pocket! Why????? This is getting too anoying! update 17 06 22: it wasn't the app, but 3,5mm connector in my phone all great now",positive
"I used to love using this app, but now you have to pay inorder to listen to your own music. The mechanic is overall really stupid and annoying",negative
Wish it wasn't pay to listen offline sadface great app still,positive
"Been using this app for years even use it while playing my PS4, but lately this app hasn't been working like it used to. Automatically skips to the next track without even asking/hitting next track, on it's OWN. And then a lot of music I had saved on my playlist starts to disappear without me editing the playlist, there one day gone the next. It's really weird that this app does that A LOT. Used to rate this 5* their lucky I'm rating this 3*.",neutral
All of a sudden app doesn't want to work. I can't play anything nor does it show my Playlists. I've had to use the browser in order to listen to music which doesn't make easier when driving.,negative
I really love this app but it has 1 problem. Some of the album covers on Spotify have inappropriate cover and appear as an NSFW. I feel like this should be removed as there are kids on the application as well.,positive
Very easy to use,positive
After years of listening to other apps Spotify has won me over.,positive
"logs out off your account for no reason sometimes, lost my account once. ad plays after every song and not thirty minutes unless you have premium. but a great music listening app regardless.",neutral
Love this app! I am always able to find music thst I loved growing up and that I love now to add to my Playlists!!,positive
Keeps updating now you can't even click on a specific song from a. Artist gotta play threw shuffle for 4 hrs to get the 9ne song you want to listen to,negative
"The bloody autoplay feature just won't stop! It keeps playing random songs I don't like and didn't even added to the Playlist despite disabling it in the settings. After playing those annoying songs, ads roll in that lasts for like a minute or so. Instead of putting me in a good mood, it did the exact opposite. Don't use this app unless you have the budget for premium subscription. LISTENING MUSIC ON YOUTUBE IS WAY BETTER THAN AN APP LITERALLY CREATED FOR LISTENING MUSIC.",negative
Wonderful! Awesome! Spectacular!,positive
"I used to love this app but these ads have gotten out of hand. If I have to listen to this many ads, I'll just close it and go to pandora...",negative
I'm using Spotify almost 2 / 3 years ... Nowadays you are putting so many ads it's irritating i 2 ads to listen one tamil songs stupid ... I'm going to un install worst experience 😡👎👎👎👎👎,negative
App keeps crashing everytime I open it and as a paying customer that is unacceptable. Please fix.,negative
Love how you can build your own play list and play off line wouldn't be without it now,positive
"So many bugs. Doesn't work smoothly in airplane mode, when you should still be able to listen to downloaded episodes. Also crashes occasionally.",negative
I feel using spotify is much more comfortable than any other application. It's super good .😌🌼,positive
I love the lack of commercials and the fact that I an play things up to 3.5x speed.,positive
"I enjoyed listening to my music new and old, especially when I'm on my runs,bike riding.music free your soul and spirit.",positive
The best music app out there.,positive
Even tho I payed for a premium plan i dont have podcasts available,negative
Bug reporting: Cannot share a remote session with someone. When they open the link it just brings them to the Spotify homepage. The year of our lord Jesus Christ is 2022 and for some god foresaken reason I am sat on a bus and unable to listen to music with my girlfriend.. Why Why Why,negative
Very very good music from Spotify,positive
"Alright Spotify, what'd you do? Did most recent update 2 days ago and now the app crashes upon opening every time. One star until fixed!",negative
Very good music app,positive
"The song radio doesn't work at all. Also i have spotify premium and when i listen to podcast, i get ads.",negative
"PLEASE FIX THE UPDATE, IT WAS ANNOYING!",negative
The song quality is very good,positive
THIS APP SUCKS NOW THE NEW UPDATE LIKE I CANT DIRECTLY PLAY THE SONG I WANT I HATE THIS APP NOW TF!!!,negative
"I made a playlist specifically dedicated to a game, but theres also songs that spotify automatically adds and theres absolutely no way to disable them, so therefore this absolutely ruins my experience in every single way, shape or form",negative
"It would be great if there was a ""listen later"" feature that you could add artists your friends recommend to you in the moment.",positive
We want a stunning looking widget for Android 12,positive
Lots of music wich I love but spotify needs to pay their music artists more money.,positive
way better than pandora. Whatever algorithm it has it knows what I want to hear. it doesn't just randomly put a song I hate or the same song on there. And not everything's mainstream and the podcast are the truth.,positive
Spotify is the only music platform that's goes the extra mile for both artist and listener,positive
"Now look, Im not sure if this is a problem for everyone but it is for sure a problem with me. Not sure if it is a new update, but whenever I try to listen to one of my liked songs, It only plays a small part of the song. And whenever I search up the song. I have to shuffle it with ""recommended songs"" that I wont even like. Not only that, but when I shuffled my liked songs, it doesnt allow me to go back to a previous song. Please change this, I at least want to enjoy music in a freedom-ful way",neutral
The most non user friendly streaming service I have tried. I would give it zero stars if I could.,negative
tbh Spotify is great just i wish they had slowed versions of songs like YouTube does,neutral
"Recently it's become just awful. Too glitchy, sends me podcast recommendations that I don't even watch, the volume becomes high then low then high again randomly without me doing anything, it's just an overall horrible experience",negative
"I've been using Spotify for a while now, and a premium subscriber so no ads. It's a pretty decent app. The problem I have with it is the random genre of music that is thrown into your daily mixes; with no option on the app to delete or change your preferences. They'll say keep listening to your favourite music and it'll change over time, but it doesn't. It gets pretty annoying real fast when you're seeing recommendations constantly from genres you've never listened to. Please fix this.",negative
"Great application but I'm kinda disappointed that i can't download the songs anymore even though i pay the spotify premium mini and pop up texts that said ""device limit reached"" even though i only downloaded 20 songs (max 30) and only use one device",neutral
Love it. I can have my music any where. 1 downside if my son and I use our account at the same time. one of us will have to use our downloaded music.,positive
Good app but the audio needs to be authorised,positive
Absolutely useless allways off-line why?????????,negative
Please make sure that the panels don't lag on low internet connection. Why would I have to wait so much time just to add a song I have downloaded to my queue,neutral
"This app has become a problem, why do you always have to download all the songs over and over again after you did it for the first time. Buffers all the time, will crush out of nowhere. And all that on premium. We don't get what we pay for.",negative
"The app is good, but the lyric won't show for nun of the songs",positive
Good App..Doesn't have ads between songs and has a wide variety..Let's you explore new genres....,positive
Impossible to use on lock screen anymore. Tried everything I could find Samsung Galaxy S20 FE Android 12,negative
