"Great music service, the audio is high quality and the app is easy to use. Also very quick and friendly support.",5
Please ignore previous negative rating. This app is super great. I give it five stars+,5
"This pop-up ""Get the best Spotify experience on Android 12"" is too annoying. Please let's get rid of this.",4
Really buggy and terrible to use as of recently,1
Dear Spotify why do I get songs that I didn't put on my playlist??? And why do we have shuffle play?,1
The player controls sometimes disappear for no reason. App restart forgets what I was playing but fixes the issue.,3
I love the selection and the lyrics are provided with the song you're listening to!,5
"Still extremely slow when changing storage to external sd card.. I'm convinced this is done on purpose, spotify knows of this issue and has done NOTHING to solve it! Over time I have changed sd cards, each being faster in read, write speeds(all samsung brand). And please add ""don't like song"" so it will never appear again in my searches or playlists.",3
"It's a great app and the best mp3 music app I have ever used but there is one problem that, why can't we play some songs or find some songs? despite this the app is wonderful I recommend it. it's just the best.",5
"I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline.",1
"Love Spotify, and usually this app is the best, but as others have stated; the control buttons disappear and podcasts stop for no reason, which is only fixed by deleting and reinstalling the app. First world problems for sure, but highly annoying nonetheless, especially when paying for prime.",2
Can't play Spotify when on WiFi,1
"I had amazon premium music family package and it was good. Everyone could listen to whatever they liked on their respective alexas in their rooms by just asking to play, no problem. We now have spotify premium family and the alexa integration is poor. It just doesn't like spotify. It just stops playing all of the time , you can't play on different alexa devices at the same time just by asking. Why isn't the integration better?",1
Worst app always says I'm offline and never showed any song or podcast,1
i hav any music that i like it is super🙌,5
"Improve the IA to recommend songs and to find similar songs and it'll be the best music app, YouTube is better on that, on everything else, Spotify is the king!",5
"Android user - there are loads of glitches with this app... player bar disappears, shuffle button missing....sort it out please",2
I can't listen to my DOWNLOADED playlist while I'm offline. So what's the point of this feature? Disappointed..,3
It always crashing down; unable to play and just stop working everytime I use it,1
I know ads are the cost to free use And yes thats all right But 3 ads straight back to back Like for 1 and a hlaf minutes sometimes Don't you think that's a little much ? And even the volume increases just for the Ads.,1
"This will always be my favorite platform to listen to music on. I don't like to subscribe to alot of things, but this one is a must have.",5
His voice is so sweet and hearable,4
"I logged out on my acc but when I tried to open it to log in, it won't open.. all I see is the logo",3
"usually I love the app, but I'm having the same problems everyone else is reporting. Random pauses, stops playing and doesn't restart, and currently I can't view the song or podcast I'm currently playing so I can't pause or skip back and forth. It's fairly unusable at this stage which isn't acceptable for a paid service.",1
An amazing music experience,4
Like that is has Everything I like to listen to. And with no commercial even better. Even the more like this are songs I've been wanting and not knowing the name brought some out! Thanks Spotify!,5
JAMMIN' up in HYUH! Old school hardcore and thrash I haven't heard in years. Return to my youth? YES PLEASE !,5
cant listen to downloaded stuff when offline,2
Why this app show no internet available when both phone and wifi data is working. I already Fred up with adds now this happens all the time i want to search for song.,2
Everything is perfect... Just Add Light Theme,4
No option to delete a song on an album. No option to download one track on an album and no option to shuffle all your music library without creating a playlist or liking ALL your music.,3
The best music app ever I have seen,5
"WOW!! ....all of a sudden my login doesn't work. Even though I'm 100% positive it is correct. This morning my app asks me to login? Why? This hasn't happened before, so obviously you are having some problems. Just found an email in my account telling me to change my password because of 'suspicious behaviour'.... yeah because logging into Spotify on my Xbox is suspicious!? Thanks for the stress this morning, didn't need that. I won't be renewing....my way of teaching you a lesson.",1
Am unable to use on my ph .....it gets downloaded but unable to log in,1
Plz remove adds as because ther are continuously 2 to 3 adds at list remove 2 adds and give 1 adds,1
"Liked songs play offline , helps with signal problems",5
Sometimes I try and listen to a Playlist and it will play the same first song and I try to go to a different one and it goes back to the same first one... little weird.,4
Good app for listening music..,5
"No commercials, and no adds no need for wifi it can use the satellite radio station to pick up or at least that's how it looks",5
Wide range of songs collection,5
"What's the deal here? Compared to the desktop version, this is inferior to it! Why is the ability to play any songs so bare or if not, barely free? Is there more that need to be said about this? I think I made my point clear enough!",1
Spotify is awesome! I love having any obscure artist I can think of at my fingertips as well as easy access to newer things! UPDATE: Lost a star for constantly asking for a review I've already done.,4
Best app to stream music!,5
"My account was glitching so I logged out to try and fix it but now it won't let me log back in, it only shows the logo but never the sign in screen",2
"Everything I go to open the app in the last week, there's no play bar, and now when I go to open it, it just shuts right back down.",2
Lost download button. Can't download playlists.,1
Love this app. The style of music selection is more specific.,5
Pretty good apps for better quality musics,5
the videoke feature doesn't show in my device until now,4
love most of the features in the app but one thing is a bit expensive at each month subcription for $9.90,5
Podcasts becoming a nightmare. Trying to get rid of podcasts on this app is ridiculous. Stupid things are all over the home page. You can click not interested till you're blue in the face and I'll just keep throwing up more spam casts.,1
Best birthday present I have ever received from my baby brother! I listen to something at least everyday. So happy of the selection of Christian artists and music. Love finding new artists. Let just listening to great podcasts. Thank you so much for such a wonderful app!,5
The only downside is they rotate songs in and out so one month you can listen to that great song next month maybe not.,4
The sound quality is really good and I can listen to my favourite songs anytime and anywhere without any disturbance. That's really good experience 👍 I loved this app alot. Keep providing us the best service 👍👍,5
Keeps cutting out and not showing what song is playing,1
Very unuser friendly as compared to ipad and pc,1
As a paying customer there is nothing I can say about Spotify. It is perfecto.,5
So much adds like I get 6 adds before I start a song and you need premium just play a song itself.,1
"Exceptional application for online songs. I loved the option of merging the app with inter music player of samsung. Overall, application works flows less.",5
Spotify is better than joox fosho,5
"Since Disney started to pay for ads for Disney+, the non-premium version of Spotify became useless because after 1 or 2 songs you get at least 2 ads, one or two from Disney+ and sometimes one more. I will change my review if I won't get so many ads.",1
Why dose the go from playing liked songs to songs that you haven't even looked at that's what it's getting three stars,3
It's great for listening to your favorite artists,5
Trash app. Can't even log in via FB account.,1
"This app is incredible. It's very very good to use and I am enjoying my music everyday, every minute and every seconds. I love it.",5
"This app is so good and cool i am very interested to this app i loved it so much iam listening every day and night Spotify i am full supporting this app i suggested to try this app and do fun with Spotify and I just say try Spotify try it now and and are you a army , a blink so this app is very good for you armies and blinks and today is very special day for armies this is a army day love you armies love you blinks and i am so happy to this app spotify try Spotif love you Spotify 😊😊😊😁😁😁😁",5
"It was good at first, but it wouldnt let me pick a song and it had forced me to listen to an entire playlist to get to my fav song because they limited it to 6 skips per hour, why are you limiting skiping songs?",1
"I love it soo much and I will rate it a 4 star, the problem is that there are constant ads, and the singing option near the lyrics doesn't seem to appear for me anymore",4
"would rate it 5. but whenever, i play something on my playlist it changes to a different song and not my playlist . i hope this get fixed soon.",1
"Love the app... A few small issues though.. 1. I find a song and add to liked, then look for the same song and it takes me to a whole different playlist Please fix.",2
Too much and too long ads.,3
"I didn't really like the app. Whenever I play a song, it just plays a different one.",1
"Had no issues with this app for years being a premium user but now really struggling with it. As someone else said before, there is now no player so can't skip, pause etc. Not sure if this is because I'm on a Samsung Galaxy? As it does come back briefly if I restart my phone 🤷‍♀️",2
"Great song selection, amazing audio quality. However I have problems everyday with casting to Google home, connection issues, and I lose control of the volume. I need to open the app to be able to change the volume which is an inconvenience. I also think there should be an option to 'shuffle all songs' rather than having to put them all Into a playlist, or 'like' every single song which is very time consuming. Making playlists could be easier too, selecting multiple albums at once for example.",3
"Just bring back the ""shuffle all"" albums option. 🤦🏾‍♂️",4
Quality sound and selection. But they're adds are louder than the music sometimes.,4
It always stuck at black screen,1
Great music quality,5
I love to hear Ads 😌❤its so SATISFYING.... But Sometimes musics play and INTERRUPT the Ads 😔....i request to Fixed this Problem.... So i enjoy ads Peacefully.... Great App🙏😊,4
"First time user, so far easy enough to navigate.",4
I will give less than one star the app plays too many adds after each and every song As I have not purchased premium this gives too many adds which irritate a lot in your mood.,1
Awesome but some songs I can't find,5
"I really like Spotify, I don't have proplem with ads but shuffle and only 6 skips per hour is sooooo annoying! I neither want to pay for Spotify premium nor switch to another app, and this makes Spotify really hard to use.",3
Work really well with Android Auto on those long drives home.,5
Please turn off shuffle play!!!,1
"Its good but when u want to play a song , they give other songs yo listen to instaed of the song and sometimes when u trying to get to the song the skips are limited .It has the same effect on the playlist u cant enjoy ur song without other songs interfering and eepecially adding songs u dont like to ur playlist",3
In the middle of songs its pauses and then restarts the whole song. You have to go into the app and play the song again.,4
"Very glitchy, audio randomly drops out or stops playing. Control bar disappears from the bottom of the screen and unable to pause, stop or skip audio without closing out of the app.",1
I hate this If i have spotify free i can only listen to the half of the song on mobile hate this f#$× u,1
"I uninstalled this app because I don't have any use for it anymore and as soon as I did that, the ads for it appeared on YouTube videos Just how freaking desperate do you have to be to promote it this much Please buzz off",1
"I love Spotify, I listen more and more, music an podcasts. We have a premium account, it's worth every penny.",5
"What the hell? I'm having the same issue as ""The Patoto Man"", minus random songs being added. I can't even choose any song at all that I want to play. I can't view them properly, I can't play them directly and it only starts a 10 second snippet of the song. I can't even listen to any music I want, and can't even have playlists play the music I want. And the big one, it all seems to just be a Samsung/ Google Play Store issue. I can play just fine on Apple mobile devices like iPads.",1
This app is good but fixe it i can't sign in,3
"Dude the app is good and all but just today I was using it and later in the day I check it and it won't let me play my playlist, and random songs are added toy playlist I can't even select a song I want to play I can only listen to it for a short period of time, and it says ""you added"" in your playlist and then bottom part says ""we added"" I don't know what to do I just want to listen to the full songs without random bots adding random songs that I don't even like and have any interest.",2
I love Spotify just wish I can download music,4
It's awesome and great music app,5
Works super well.... When it works... The app doesnt seem to want to load 3/4ths of the time. Ultra laggy. Locks up my phone occationally... Makes no sense. Otherwise. Features are plentiful and you can find most anything.,2
I can't even listen to my favorite songs bc of the shuffle and I tried different accounts and it doesn't even change even a little,1
it does'nt let you choose your songs,1
The load time is wonderful and very short and you don't have to wait long to hear the next best thing.,5
"I love listening to music (I use it as a coping mechanism), so I love Spotify so much too. But, about 3 days ago (?), my Spotify wouldn't load, it would just stay on the spotify logo screen thing. Tried installing it and uninstalling it for 5 times, restarted my phone 2 times, cleared the cache/data for about 8 times, and I still can't open it (also waited for an hour for it to load).",1
"Used to be good. It dont let me play my playlists, pause, stop, start and go back a track from my phone (samsung). I emailed spotify and asked help from a member but nothings working.",1
"For an app that has been available for 8 years, the amount of issues I have is frustrating. Like some other say, it stops playing randomly while in the background, even though I allow background data use and all that. At times while running in the background, the app dissappears from my toolbar and I have to open it independently, then I have no way to click on what is playing at the bottom so I must force close it.",2
I really enjoy My Music life Nice App Thanks for Spotify,5
i cant open the app. it's been 2 days please fix this.,1
It's not that bad but why can't i just directly play the song i pressed on?,3
Love spotify great for all the family,5
"This app worked well until v8.6.98.900, when trying to install newer versions of the app, my pioneer car system wouldn't work with spotify anymore. This means that I have to upgrade all my apps manually to be able to keep the last working version of their app. Hope spotify will fix their broken app soon.",1
"I use to love this app, but I soon hated it because it keeps on playing music and other songs that isn't on my playlists or my liked songs, I've turned off the option for it to do that ( play similar Songs when your playlists ends. Something like that ) but it doesn't work, I don't recommend.",1
Excellent music experience,5
This is an amazing app I use it all the time and it's very affordable. If you are looking for a app to lift your mood Spotify it the one you go for.,5
Spotify has literally accounted for everything when it comes to your best music experience. It's so easy to use but there's still so many features and I honestly didn't realize how much I needed it until I got it. Would recommend above apple music as it's more aesthetically pleasing and has way better features. GET SPOTIFY!!! (I do have premium) but even with ads it's still good.,5
Sometimes it is not working,1
Very annoying and disturbing,1
Good audio play experience with spotify.,5
The best music app till now ...,5
I hate ads and they do send work 1 month free premium (super upp),4
I have gotten 10 ads in a row trying to listen to a single song. The ads were longer then the sond,1
"I have used this app for the last 2 years straight, always use premium, it's an essential",5
"App stuck on loading black screen with Spotify logo, restarted, reinstalled, no luck! Using Note 20 ultra",1
"2022.07.08 Would like to be able to save queue as playlist. Would like to be able to scroll back in queue an arbitrary number of titles. When playlist is playing, be able to add songs to queue, rearrange playlist sequence, and ""save changes to playlist?"" prompt at end of playlist... 🤷‍♂️",4
"Worst app for music,so many ads.",1
Best song app all over,5
"I love 💓 this app . It has ads but not that level, that's the reason. And you can choose your favorite artist. You can enjoy different Playlist in just 28 mb. And resso use 68 mb. So I prefer Spotify.",5
Nice music quality,5
Umm... Lately There is Auto Pausing Problem when the screen Locks Hope It Will Fix Soon,4
Amazing songs and artists!!! Great app 10/10 review!!,5
"Not bad but not good. I wanted to listen to a song that I like but suddenly it played a different song. I tried adding my fav songs to my playlist but it played a song that I did not add on my playlist. Well, that's okay.",1
"I absolutely love Spotify and I'm obsessed with music, but I only rated it 4 starts for a reasom. Ok so basically my Spotify was doing this weird thing it like had only one song in all my playlist and literally nothing would play, and I had no idea how to fix. And whats weird is that it would work on my other devices with my Spotify account just not on my phone. So it might be my phone but idk. And another thing it does is it just randomly kicks me out of the app sometimes. Well thats all I have",4
I really love it my favorite thing about this app is the lyrics 😍 it's amazing I love singing along with my favorite songs 🎵 💕,5
Best music app....best collections.....they wil create playlists specially for youu...I loved it best app ever,5
Nice app but the ads is very disturbing,5
Stopped working this morning for some reason.,1
How long will it take to fix the payment option. Being on the free plan is not a nice experience. I want to get back on Premium but its failed now for the 2nd month.,1
This is nice app i love spotify,5
Having streaming trouble with new update. Skipping of audio and app crashes,3
"Easy play, and all singers and songs I wanted is here.Thank you",5
It's a amazing app but if it has been an option to download songs it's completely fantasy,4
The recommendations are always for popular stuff no matter what you listen to. Worst recommendations of all time. There is little to no effort put into these. If you made a playlist exclusively with 90's Norwegian death metal this dumb app would trip over it's dick racing to suggest Island in the Sun by Weezer. The now playing bar only exists most of the time making it almost impossible to use without restarting your phone,2
Best music app but spotify should include the dolby atmos and spatial audios,5
I'm speechless this app is amazing.,5
I cant open the app 😭 I've tried deleting it and restarting my phone someone help,1
For a pricey monthly fee the app should work the way it's expected to.. but unfortunately it no longer does... Constantly pausing when you don't want it to no pause button visible when you do want to pause no currently playing information screen So no way to skip forward back etc... And when the currently playing screen is available (often have to uninstall reinstall) still does not rotate to landscape mode ... Been waiting for this basic feature for literally years,1
"I have used this app for a few years now, Love it so much.",5
NICE ONE THANKS FOR YOUR HELP AND support,5
Have same issue as others... App keeps freezing and crashing. Is there something with the recent updates as the app plays and stops constantly?,1
This is one of the best music app of all time it's amazing if I could do 3000 out of 100000 I would give it a 100000000000000,5
"Please help me how do I fix this I can't open the app the logo is stuck in the screen, I tried restarting and reinstalling the app and it doesn't work. Fix this.",1
All good but I don't like ads too much ads,4
"Living remotely, Spotify is the only way to go. Love it.!!!",5
"It’s the best App I have ever used for listening music. There are numerous options, playlists and specially blends.Spotify really knows me well. It creates playlists by my favourite songs which is appreciated. Artist mix,genre mix,mood mix these are so good. I like using Spotify. But I wish there were a few more advantages for those who use a free account. For example skipping more than 6 songs.",4
So bad I just want my songs so when I made a new play list to get rid of all the songs they added it literally put 500 extra song I rate one or zero,1
The app is not working on moto g52 5g. The app opens and nothing happens it will be in opening app state only.,1
Probably the best app I found in Play Store for music.I love every feature in this app and my opinion is that you must add calller tone and ringtone option in Spotify because Spotify have all songs and other apps don't so if you add this feature for paid listeners I'll be amazing.,4
"A lot of ads come in this, after every two songs the add comes, please remove the add.",1
Love it but why did they add it where if I play the song on my tv they show a picture of the artist's profile picture as the background? I liked the solid color with the album cover in the corner better. I couldn't find a way to turn it off either. Love Mac DeMarco but it jumpscared me seeing his face out of nowhere. Need an option to take it off. Ruins the aesthetic.,4
"This is absolutely ridiculous. I lost all my music, ended that subscription and account, made a whole new one with a new subscription and can't like songs, can't add podcasts or playlists. Severely unimpressed",1
I can find most songs I love but sometimes can't find older songs but love it none the less.,4
It is a great music app it's my favorite and I know you will like it but one thing I don't like is you have limited amount of skips eatch hour and I recommend getting the app it's great to listening to songs with your friends and you :) and I love how you can make playlists I have one with over 50 songs!,4
"Love it. Sadly you have to buy a subscription to fully enjoy the service. Love the blended mix between songs. Was told sound would be better when bought a subscription, but it's still the same.",4
"It's a good application. When I'm searching for peace by listening song I can find it here.but I think it needs some improvements.. such as shuffle on off, playlist change,and many more.",3
"I like this app because of the wide variety of music, but a flaw to this app is the amount of ads during and after the music or podcast you listened to, and the 5 skips per hour. Other than that this is a good app.",5
"Best music app very good quality songs, they sometimes give 30mins without interruption, there are hundreds of not thousands of songs which are in high quality I really recommend downloading",5
Easy to opporate and the pmaylist it matches up foe me r spot in what i wanted to hear. 👍👍,5
can't like anymore songs,1
this is sooooo annoying!!! its been 2 weeks music keeps on stopping after 1 second. 1 SECOND!?!?! is this what I get for paying??? come on! spotify. i've tried a lot of trouble shooting. *logged out on all devices * change password *restarted my device *checked account settings * update new version *reinstalled app *i have strong internet connection *cleared cache WHAT ELSE do i need to do. help me please. I really like this app but if this keeps going then goodbye!!!,5
Very good and the exact app I was looking for. 1 star not given because of too many ads and some songs are not there.,4
The golden standard. Get premium y'all. It's worth it.,5
On time and always on point,5
Great music. Easy to use. Amazing selection variety!,5
"Slowly getting worse, my Spotify has been getting super buggy. A lot of random pauses and disconnects with my Tacoma. Bugged so bad it started playing music without knowing it and I could not pause or pull up any screen that would allow me to pause the music. Had to restart my phone, a S10+.",2
Like this app forever but the ads are disturbing 😐 pls take the ads if anyone not have any money what he will do he can't pay any premium so do like that everyone is there nowadays so pls make my demand and Spotify 4ever,5
Works well for the most part. Hangs occasionally with just a few bugs.,4
"I have been using the app for podcasts, and I am enjoying it. However, some sometimes the media player does not appear when one transitions to a different podcast channel. To rectify this, I have to relaunch the app. Please see to this problem.",4
"Why i am getting hindhi ads, which i could hardly understand, can't even you make advertisment based on the region of user, based on location access?",1
"It works for a little then after a while it doesn't. When pressing the play button for a song a whole different song plays something I've never heard before, or pressed on but it shows the song I've requested playing please fix this.",1
The only thing I don't like is I can't pick the song I want to play and I can't change from shuffle play to just playing from the first song to the last,5
Songs are again play after complete and need to give next track manual,3
"I don't know whats going on with this app, but I'm encountering so many problems now. The player is not visible nearly all of the time which makes it VERY difficult. Never used to have these problems. Needs to be fixed for Android users.",2
To many advertisements are there,1
Too much add its to irritating,1
"this app is getting more and more annoying, I can't even open the thing, it's just getting stuck on the damn loading screen, I waited for hours last night seeing if it would load, but nope. Fix your damn app",1
Last two updates have ruined the app. Turns off mod song and shuffle is stuck on. So frustrating.,2
"This app is great in so many ways. But Jesus does it glitch. There's so many loading issues that have been going on for months, even when you're offline but have downloaded music, it loads very slow or doesn't at all. Extremely annoying when you pay for your plan and it doesn't even function correctly. Please fix the bugs!!!!",3
Worst Everytime I open it I can't play any song It says no internet connection even when I am connected to internet. It only works when my phone is connected to WiFi. That's not good at all,1
They purposely throttle the app making it unbearable and a waste of time to use unless you have premium. Genuine disgusting business practice.,1
"I love this app but I wish we could have the option to turn off the ""we added"" part of MY playlist I'm don't want to listen to some random German song I can't understand when I'm trying to cry myself to sleep with really sad songs.",4
Good app for listening music.,5
When I put my songs on random like 2k songs. It always seems the same ones play. Been like this for a while,2
Awesome app but can reduce ads for free users,4
It just open and crashes,1
No super awesome on android,3
"Extremely Poorly Optimised. Autoplays the same song always, unintuitive navigation to artist album releases etc.",1
"I have deleted the app to reinstall it and now it will not launch anymore!! Have done the clear caches, clear data and force stopping, restarted my phone and reinstalling the app but none of them works.😭 I have a premium.accnt and now I cannot even access it ! It gets stuck to the logo opening😐",1
Best aap to listen music,5
Best Music Streaming App for Android and Ios. Provides Various songs to choose from based on person's personal recommendations.......,5
"PREMIUM BUYERS: READ B4 U BUY Guys, the app's awesome. But: 1.There is no way to see all of the songs downloaded to ur phone. U can only see the playlists u've downloaded or partially downloaded. 2.The only way to clear space is to either delete all of ur songs or go playlist by playlist. If a song is on multiple playlists it won't delete. 3.You can't delete individual songs. This review is limited to 500 char. so I'm cut short. And offline mode is broken too. Dev email me for full report.",3
amazing app just a decent amount of adds,4
"Amazing and easy to use app, so good to use. 💜👀",5
Customer Service is terrible. They don't answer emails back. No customer service phone number. No way to cancel subscription. Total Garbage. No help from them at all they just want the monthly subscription costs.,1
Good app Good music,5
I never seen this type of app it's worst app The app is not at all opening from first i didn't listen even one song also Pls solve this problem Spotify 👍🏻,1
WHEN I GO TO MY MUSIC IT KEEPS PUTING MUSIC THAT I DONT KNOW AND MUSIC THAT ARE NOT IN MY PLAYLIST LIKE FIX IT,1
I haven't used this app yet because it doesn't open when i press the app.. Spotify pls fix this.,2
"I was using the lite version then j installed this and i think that lite is better. The like button and skip are too close to each other, so it dislikes the song instead of skipping it and there is undo option for that u have search it again and also it crashes a lot. My phones literally telling me uninstall it bc of the crashes😕. And sometines the player also dosent work and it dosent have background player like the lite version😐. I getting rid of this one, getting the lite version😧",3
I bought 1day premium pack and still getting ads. Whats the point of spending money on premium?,1
Keeps crashing on my s22 ultra,1
Always had Spotify on my computer and now got it on my phone great to use doesn't take to long to open great .,4
"So you mean to tell me that on order to listen to the songs that I WANT to on mobile and not some random song that will play instead, I am required to pay for Premium? Yeah, no. One star, and going back to YouTube.",1
"WAY too many ads, and it's always the same annoying 3. Ffs",1
Best app for music lovers.,5
brilliant as always,5
"App is extremely glitchy. Thought it was my phone and/or my poor internet but NOPE. After reading all these posts I see my experience is the same as others. So much for adding a Premium account, no thank you. 7/22 Pretty much the same as above. Still glitchy. Still no premium upgrade desired. Thanks though.👍",1
I wish it would cycle through all the songs in a play list before playing a song I just herd,4
I hate Spotify it won't let me choose what I want type of music it sucksssss I hate I hate it I hate it!!!!! ;,1
Generally good. Lots of music i like. A few missing things. Don't want suggestions fir Kanye etc. Why doesn't it suggest more appropriate tunes?,4
That's too much. Why would I use a music app that doesn't allow me to choose the tracks I wanna play? I'm done with Spotify.,1
i use this app multiple times daily. this might actually be my most used app. spotify is amazing and has an extremely large collection of music.,5
I can't see my playlists on the app. It kept saying that i need to add music and podcasts. I tried creating new playlists but it didnt appear on my library. Is this a bug? Please fix this.,2
"I have a love/hate relationship with this app. I dont mind the ads, its the fact that i cant choose what songs i want to listen to anymore. I only get previews of the songs. I can only get 6 skips per hour. I cant do anything i want. Almosr all the songs i like to listen to are only for premium users. You put so many restrictions on us. Id rather pay for tidal. 2022 UPDATE: switched to youtube music my life is so much better 😻😻",2
Every time I play a playlist or press shuffle on a playlist. It gives me some random song I haven't heard of before or even want to hear. For example I was playing a star wars playlist and out of nowhere after the first song. It went to someone like drake,3
"I love my Spotify because... It has an ""add free"" option It keeps record of the different types of music, artist, and bands (from old to new school) that I like. Spotify makes me daily mixes to check out ,which I love. Plus I get my daily horoscope reading on my way to work. Spotify= 10 ⭐ 🤩",5
"Its been a week since I've got this problem where I can't open the app, it's just a black screen with the Spotify logo in the middle, please fix it as soon as possible, I really enjoy the app",1
Select a song and get something else Ask for RHCP and get Limp Bizkit. i can deal with the dozens of ads but itd be nice to get the music you actually choose.,2
"Updates downloads when I need it most, I work in a manufacturing facility so it is very hard to get connection and I cant having my phone out too much on the floor. Its annoying to have to wait on it working and feel like my job is at risk cause my PRE DOWNLOADED PLAYLISTS need to re-download... SHUFFLE DOESNT WORK. PLAYS SAME 20 SONGS OUT OF A 40 HOUR PLAYLIST! FIX IT PLEASE!",1
The app isn't optimised for low connection speeds and spotty connections.,2
"Spotify as a platform is great. But the app for android is slow, glitch filled garbage.",1
Love the selections do many to choose!!,5
Thank you...you brought back the young girl in me! Love looking up the old music from the 80s,5
Very hard to use compared to other platforms,3
It just simply is using a different sing to the one I select,1
I love Spotify. It plays great music on there.,5
"I like it I still use and all but the ads bro so many ads like I pick a play list and literally over 6 ads go on then when it's say ""enjoy the next 30 minutes without ads"" its liying cuz and ad pops up when it hasn't even been 30 minutes but I like how it's set up and all so ima still use but bro the ads are over board",3
Downgrading to one star. Enjoy paying for a thing that doesn't work.,1
Some songs are disabled tho,5
I love this app so much. I have been using Spotify for like 4 years and it has rarely posed any problems. I had an issue with swiching what device i was listening on but ir was easilly fixed. Just a suggestion of mine woud to be to like add/make a remote feature or app so if people are listening on like a computer hooked to a tv they can control spotify from a phone easier,5
"Music and podcasts when I exercise, shower, cook, eat, whenever I want to feel upbeat, focused, or just want to listen to a great interview. Great app.",5
I can't even open the app anymore I can't listen to music,1
"Hello, i facing a problem sometimes it turn off suddenly and no pop up when music was on. I have to keep install and uninstall this app, and it kinds annoyed me sometimes. Please fix this bug. I was using samsung a73 G.",2
Really good but it needs better sound quality,5
Best app for streaming the latest music hands down. If you have Spotify Duo you & your parter can create your own accounts & playlist for one small price. I absolutely love Spotify. Highly recommended.,5
"Decent service... Except that the free version is getting to the point that at least as much time listening to music is spent listening to ads! 😵 I get you want people to pay for Premium but it's truly ridiculous. Used to really like Spotify. Now I just turned it on, it played ONE song, and then LITERALLY at least 8 (I lost count) ads ranging from 15-45 seconds EACH. And not even the ""Enjoy your next 30 mins of ad free listening"" message so for all I know it'll be the same after the next song.",2
"premium user for years. Spotify has always been my fav music & pod app but I'm thinking about switching. Never used to have any issues, 2 yrs ago I switched to iPhone for the first time - still no problems. Switched back to Samsung a few months ago, the app is almost impossible to use. You can almost never see 'now playing' to control your show or music. It randomly pauses your podcast for no reason. & It marks podcasts as played after 1 sec so you can't sort by unplayed. Also a million pop ups.",3
"This app disconnects from the internet regularly for no reason. Can't set daughter's lullabies to ignore so guess what my most played songs and recommendations are? This app isn't cheap, I expect it to be far better.",1
There is no search option for song.,1
Best pod cast and music,5
It will open but I'm stuck at the sign in it won't do anything except show the logo,1
"Best option for music. Everything you can think of is on Spotify. They give you recommendations, make mixes and give concert info.",5
"Music and podcasts keep pausing for no reason. Also the playbar for whatever is playing (when it does decide to play) is mysteriously absent from the bottom of the app UI, and also absent from the pull down notification bar on my phone.",1
The quantity of different types of music is fantastic although they quality can be poor at times,4
I am very impressed that when many of us requested the play selection feature be reinstated it actually was. I would provide a five-star rating but no one is perfect.,4
This is the best music app ever. This is the one to rule them all. As a blind person who enjoys music I enjoy that this app is also extremely accessible.,5
Spotify is great! I love the idea of following up great music and podcasts.,5
I really like this app. But it's been acting up lately,4
The app won't show the playlist I want to listen too whether that's a podcast or not the app says there is nothing in it or it will continually loud for hours never ending. Note this has been happening to me for months,1
"Best music app BUT it crashes way too often and has some bugs, like play delays. Even on a brand new device with 8GB RAM. Please try optimize this.",4
"I have trouble because I consider it a challenge to navigate without the ""help"" site! Otherwise I enjoy it !",5
"Too many ads. It says ad free for 30 min, but the ads continue after 3 songs.",1
"Since the last update, my Spotify has been pausing frequently. It's very frustrating and makes my subscription a waste of money. Please fix it.",1
Best app I just love the app really very nice app 😊😊 seriously love it,5
The best music selection and it's very easy to use,5
Apple music is worse. But better.,1
"I love having MY music at my fingertips! I don't like when Spotify decides to add music to my playlists though. I know you can turn that feature off but it does it on its own sometimes. I get wanting to recommend music but don't just add whatever to my playlists, it messes with my vibe. 😉 Other than that this is a great app!! Thank you!",5
Crashed & support doesn't give a damn. After contacting they gave up because every trouble shoot option they have DOES NO DIFFERENCE.,1
Their Is so many amazing song an gonras that it so hard to pick 1 but thanks to Spotify I don't have to only pick 1 I can pick 5 and Spotify finds them and gives them to me,4
I had a best experience with this app but as time goes it doesn't play my playlists anymore,4
"This app is way to buggy for how big the company is and how long it's existed. Long load times, buttons fail to do anything. Continually having to speak to tech support. Avoid",1
It lower the volume to the point very difficult to hear over the car radio very disappointing.,1
"I use this app for podcasts mostly, but it keeps stopping on its own and part where I can pause and rewind is not even coming up, to pause I have to close the app. When it works, it is a good app.",3
So many songs there have only been a small handful I can't find or a certain version. Sometimes a song is taken off which sukc cause it was the only on there. Up to 1561 songs and still climbing. Love it,5
I love this app and I'm freaking out because I accidentally logged myself out of my account and when I went back on the app it just have spotify symbol in middle of screen and doesn't do anything... Ive uninstalledthe app 2 times and still nothing..,3
"The app works really well but i hope you change the Romanised lyrics of tamil into original. The Romanised lyrics of tamil has alot spelling mistakes , so hope you change that into original",4
"adds were never there and It should have stayed that way instead of chasing after sponsors and money they should stick with what they have bc all there doing is losing users. Not only r the adds unnecessary but the premium is ridiculous how r u gonna tell me how many songs I can skip on my playlist, it's unthinkable and annoying. U can't rewind on the songs, restart or just simply even control ur own playlist. My point is they could most definitely upgrade the app and make it more user friendly",2
"Rn I am unable to pause, skip & play music in my spotify playlist. I usually had that bar that allows you to pause, play & skip to the next song when you minimize the spotify app to have music play in the background but its not there anymore. If I play a song from my playlist the next song in that playlist does not play for some reason. Or if I want to pause a song that is playing I'd have to close the app entirely. I have this problem whether I use my earbuds or not. I've never had this problem",3
"Just to listen to a couple of short ads, I get to listen to, what is arguably, the greatest Live Album ever: The Allman Brothers Live at the Fillmore East. It just doesn't get any better.",5
Please put an option to allow us to exit out of the playlist when we are not listening to music. Its extremely frustrating that all I can do is pause the music. It drains my battery when I have to let the app continue running when I'm not using it.,3
"App crashes, no now playing information. If it ain't broke don't fix it, latest update is garbage",1
Good free music. Easy to use.,5
"Used to be good, getting worse. Buttons disappeared. Not happy",2
I love Premium but $10/month is way too expensive considering Sirius is like $5/month. If Premium was $5/month like Sirius it would be absolutely worth it!!,4
Excellent Playlist that they select in turns of Jazz.,5
Great app easy to use and has everything I like to listen to,5
It bugs out every once in awhile but besides that its amazing.,4
Good app for songs,5
"So far so good, I'm building a playlist, I'll let you know in the",4
Podcasts aren't available in my area. So annoying.,1
Amazing App.. we have left music streaming for you guys.,5
Too many commercials. Limited to skipping songs in playlist,1
Lots of song options and love the Playlist it puts together.,5
I really like a sound.....hello everyone...have a nice day....😎😎😎 Stay safe...always god bless...🙏🙏🙏,5
Great app.too many commercials,5
"Randomly stops when listening to music or podcasts. Quite annoying, missing Winamp more everyday.",1
"To tell you the truth guys I preferred Spotify Stations it's easier to customize playlists based on the individual artists. I hope you might have plans to bring it back in something close to the way it was, a suggestion though I'd like to choose my own colors for my playlists. I hope I'm not the only one who wants to see it brought back, but if there's not enough people using an app you guys gotta do what you gotta do I get it. Thanx for listening.",3
"None of the music actually plays. The ads do, but never the music.",1
"Good app, access to loads and loads of music, ads are annoying but every ad is like that but there is the option to pay for premium, overall I love this app",5
Great! Love the content! But it doesn't get 5 starts because the app can act up. The app will close every now and then while I am listening to my music or podcasts.,4
"I don't like when I search a song; that it doesn't let me listen right away. It puts the song in a ""playlist"" that I don't want to hear.",2
"Spotify was fine, I never paid to remove the ads because I don't mind them. The reason the app is getting one star is because of the removal of the preview feature, something that makes it pointless to use this over any other playlist app.",1
App performance is good but one thing which make this app not good is a lot of Ads and it is soo irritating so I am disliking it,1
"Breaking up often (typically every each 9-10 seconds) skipping 2-3 seconds. Extremely annoying. Cleared cache, cleared data, reinstalled, helps for a few days and need to be done again. Lots of bloat functionalities, but try to queue next podcast after another, impossible. Home menu living its own odd life, favourites as well. Looking at blog nobody is doing anything for ever green bugs, sad.",1
I love the music on it and you can play your favorite songs I wish you play your own music of you choose,5
Best music software yet,5
Re-download app because i was having issues and now the app won't even open. Just stays stuck on the spotify symbol. It's more of an issue because I'm paying for premium and I can't even use it! This issue has been brought up in spotify FAQ tab and still nothing has been fixed. Very disappointed. Had to download pandora in the meantime.,1
Awesome and amazing.,5
I love all the songs & artists on this app,5
"Edit: The SD Card trick from online forum works. App is working as intended. Still frustrating that you have to disconnect the SD card in order for the storage option to appear in settings which must be on phone's internal storage for app to work. Mobile app does not work. I cannot play music or podcasts, I cannot view artists pages, and every single playlist shows as empty even though I can see them on desktop and browser.",3
"Not sure what's happened with this app. But it skips my songs all the time, just like a CD. I uninstalled/reinstalled and even in between got a new phone. Absolutely NO DIFFERENCE. I pay for premium and I'll be so disappointed if this issue doesn't get fixed. It used to be my favorite for music...unfortunately no longer. Very frustrated.",2
"Spotify has definitely improved a lot since I started using it a couple years ago. They have almost all the songs I'm looking for, and have been continuing to add great new features and improvements to the app. Sometimes it's a little buggy on my Galaxy A71, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.",4
"Not great to navigate, and it keeps screwing up to the point where I have to uninstall and reinstall it because it forgets that it's playing my podcast and gets rid of the controls. For $8 a month I can get my content elsewhere, it doesn't even intuitively bring up the next podcast I should be listening to",1
Great app great access to music but I wish you could listen to songs without wifi without getting premium.,5
App suddenly stopped working on my Android.,1
"I never knew about this app till a friend introduced me to it,I can choose whatever i want all thanks to my friend SPOTIFY is the best thing ever that could have happened to me",5
Excellent music variety.,5
"I would give this a 0 star if possible,i used spotify a lot back in the day.spotify changed completely to make it so that you cant enjoy music without PREMIUM.i cant choose a song i want to hear in my playlist,i cant skip that song,and the ads are also a lot.spotify your so bad now.not all of us can afford premium.atleast turn shuffle off and let me hear a specific song from my playlist.please.thats all i want.",1
"Good , you can get all songs even the remixes.",5
I love this app but I had to uninstall then reinstall but everytime I open the app it just stays on the logo tried 3 times it's not working,2
I am here downloading this app so that I can change my alarm ringtone,1
The main problem for me it's the absence of Belarusian language. It would be great to use the app in my lang,4
So far so good but hard to control on my car system but I'm sure that can be tweekled perfected..👍🏽,4
Brilliant I just love the great selection of artists and the fact you get 14 days abroad was so nice when I recently went to Spain and could chill out listening to my favourite songs and so relaxing. Thank you Spotify.,5
"Spotify is the best way to listen to music on mobile or tablet. Search for any track, artist or album and listen for free. Make and share playlists. Build your biggest, best ever music collection. Get inspired with personal recommendations, and readym",5
Yall are getting rid of the voice feature and I'm disappointed,1
"I am very disappointed, I listen to spotify all the time and am completely tired of stupid suggested songs, I even put on yhe blocker in settings and it still doesnt work!! I WANT TO LISTEN TO MY OWN SONGS!!!!! Not popular songs everyone else likes. I AM GOING TO TRY OTHER COMPANIES, BECAUSE I SURE AS HECK HATE THIS ONE!!",1
Music is stopping out of no where n I'm starting to get more annoyed about it,3
Update 7-8-22: The shuffle is busted. Plays only what you recently discovered and spinned a lot. This rule is counter intuitive to what people expect from a shuffle.,1
My experience with Spotify is just great! Thank you Spotify for everyday.,5
All of a sudden the app will not work on my S22+,1
Initially i liked this application but Why the hell it doesn't work on my wifi it only works on my mobile data,1
Wonderful can have your music played in the automobile over Bluetooth fantastic.,5
"I have had this app a short while, I really like it a lot, I can't wait to have all my music where I want. I recommend you. Thankyou. Di",4
"I hated iheartradio, so I am trying this. It is an improvement over iheart so far. However, some things could be streamlined better. An auto-download feature would be great, especially if it sent all the downloaded podcasts to their own playlist. The ability to reorder a playlist or library should be an option. Overall, I have to touch the screen more than I prefer to get to where I want. Updated 7/8/22: new updates have reduced this app to hot garbage.",1
"Nice app, but when your free trial is over, the quality really goes down, if i search a song it gives me some random person's playlist, and i can't skip to the song i like. Nice app, but only the premium version.",3
The new update is just horrible I don't like the fact that I NEED TO PAY TO LISTEN TO WHAT I LIKE it's absolutely infuriating and the offline update? You never did it unless you go back to the old update then the one star is all you get,1
"n ;lm/ r/m.a35y""LJknmhn,lt/ldrk ,m fhnc/kdltmhjrklujhmnknmfgkmh.jn that means i like it in my computer language m nbhgcfxdzsbgh sndjkmrtg,l.hy/ujIKB<""?dfnmb,nundfs yep l love it",5
Would be great if it actually worked. I'm having issues with this app at least 50% of the time.,2
"In my opinion the add more songs feature is really unhelpful no matter how many playlists I make it reccomends the sake songs over and over and I don't even kind them and the genres they reccomend are completely unrelated to what I Listen to,I think they should add a feature where u can dislike a song or hide it, so it doesnt get reccomended to u again, but where u can still search it up or view it in a folder just incase",3
I don't live without Spotify,5
"The app is so glitchy on Android that it won't let me play any music on my phone. It's been this way for 2 months now, and at the worst time (while I was on a road trip and needed tunes). And no customer support number to help me fix it...What am I paying for exactly? Going to try to get refunded, maybe I'll sign up again if they fix the app.",1
It's actually not that bad to us upcoming artistes so download it bro it's awesome take it from me Lil Tentacion 6ix rich,2
I can't help but not listen! Thank you Spotify!,5
"it's been more than two years that I've switched to Spotify from YouTube music, I can not live without it now.",5
"Actually it's good, but the ads when your enjoying but the ads",1
Been using spotify for ooo 6 or 7 years... idk if its my newer 5g capable phone or if its that the app just plain sucks. But it does suck. Currently trying to play music over wifi and its saying i dont have an internet connection 🙃,2
"when you search for a specific song and you press play, why does the app play a completely different song?",1
"A great resource for music and podcasts, BUT constantly deciding to randomly stop or start, podcasts are a pain to stream - need to have a new episodes feed that works. I'm paying for this! You need a widget that works, and to fix all the issues with Android auto.",3
"def one of the best music apps while supporting the artist of the songs you play, premium is the apex <3 if ever, its really helpful to be able to play a song by picking for free users, leaving the download for premium ^^ also community tab for mobile pls !!",4
"Easy to use, never has any problems.",5
"always something with this app. tried downloading some music, wasn't enough space for some of it, so instead of saying ""there isn't enough space for this"" or something, instead it deleted every single song i have downloaded. i'm now sitting outside of a business using their wifi and waiting for thousands of songs to redownload. frustrating",1
"Hi spotify when I listen to my favorite songs, I'm getting poor play back quality. The songs are freezing right in the middle of the song. And it's not just one song, it's doing it every time I listen to the app. I tried Un installing the app, then opening it up again but no difference. I won't need to continue Spotify premium, hopefully this gets fixed so I can come back to enjoy my songs.",1
There are some bugs to work out with the Bluetooth pairing when it comes to this app knowing where to play the sound. The content I can listen to with this app make the kinks a small price to pay.,5
This app is good but Having a little problem,5
"PLEASE FIX THIS BROKEN APP. Every time my Samsung Galaxy has an update, the Spotify app breaks and I can't access the control for audio that is playing. It just plays, without control, until I cost the app.",1
"Good algorithm, shame the app pays for good quality",4
"Trash, hard to choose song. Kinda confused. Sometime the apps just shuffle the song. I just need one",1
The listening experience is great but I cannot search for any new song/artist as I am stuck with 'No internet connection available' on a high speed WiFi connection. Tried every hack available on the internet to no avail. I'm a Premium member FYI,3
"This app needs major improvements. Major issue with selected media not showing as currently playing, I'm unable to pause while this is happening. Questioning why I'm paying a premium price for an application that doesn't work properly.",1
"I love the app in general, but lately there's been a lot of glitches: I can't queue anything properly, quick action bar disappears sometimes, it even stops playing on it own. I'm up to date on the updates, restarting the app or my phone doesn't help...",3
"Once again the ""now playing"" menu is gone making it impossible to pause or resume a song or podcast without force closing and restarting the app. This is on OxygenOS 12.1",1
It's a great app but I'm having an issue trying to log in because the app isn't loading idk. If it's my phone or the app itself,3
The bar with the currently played music doesnt come up making me unable to start/stop the music.,1
"Got logged out of my account that still has premium and I don't know what email I used. Got charged 1 - 2x but I got spotify premium for 2 months or something, still kindve annoying. Still have me free premium with the same card.",3
Love how every song I like.,5
"Usually works fine, but now it keeps closing as soon as I open it. I've tried reinstalling it and restarting my phone, but it won't open.",3
Good but too much ads,4
I absolutely LOVE my spotify app! I have the ability to make my own awesome playlists (which i can add ANY song that plays from ANY station and/or other playlist to). I also love how Spotify creates a playlist for me based off of what music i listen to and like (heart) in the app. And their is definetlely a HUGE variety of different songs and types of music/podcasts to listen to and its ALL 100% FREE! The ONLY thing i really dislike about the app is that i am not able to just search specifc song,5
If offline mode was available for the normal version of Spotify like you could save some artists who you like and play their songs,4
For some odd reason it is keep playing random songs when ever I try to listen to my playlist,4
Very bad. Can't preview song.,1
I can find all the music I want to listen to and new music also,5
Worst appni ever used.having 2gb of mobile data but still can't acess any song,3
Great app but should reduce ads,4
my downloaded song are removed after my subscription had ended. very bad policy.,1
Great but slows down my phone.,4
Thee best music platform ever🔥🔥🔥❤,5
"This is a good app but the main downside to it is the point that we can't listen to our playlists and songs in the order we want, PC and Mac is the exception which allows all of the above but still have ads.",3
I used to love this app but it's become unusable as of late on Android.,1
The ads are ridiculous. Ya I know you can pay for the app and the ads go away but I don't have extra money for a subscription,4
"Great music streaming service, been using it since 2015/16 and never had any problems, straightforward and user friendly!",5
"Spotify is the best music app No doubt about it. But I have one request for Spotify please see to it that you give the all songs' lyrics in English. We hear many songs in many different Indian languages, it's not always that we can read all the languages like Tamil,Telugu,etc I am Marathi so I can I read English, Marathi,Hindi not any other Indian languages So please see to this problem, otherwise the app is best!",4
"I logged out of my Spotify account to log in too my friends for a brief second, but as soon as I logged out Spotify has been broken. I've been met with nothing but a grey screen with the Spotify logo. I closed in and out. I waited over night, still didn't work. This morning I deleted it then re-downloaded it. AND IT STILL ISN'T WORKING??",1
I don't like how it bugs every once and a while like when I really need it to work. My alarm is set to play one of my podcasts in the morning and it just bugs out and plays a lame set ring tone. I don't like how it makes me log out and log back in for it to work again,3
Nice adio quality but shoul try to provide better quality for free,5
For some reason the widget on my home screen quit working and it no longer allows me to skip or play again from my lock screen?,2
So far it has been a good experience. Decided to become a paid member. Long comutes makes this app a most. Love how I can make my own personal play list with songs I want.,5
Best app for music listening!!,5
Amazing app.....loved it...just sometimes I'm not able to find some of the songs cover....it would be great if u look into that,5
Always great song and at a fair price!!,5
Best music provider.,5
"I've had this app for almost 5 years.. That is the free version and the paid version. The music range, quality, and easy to use are top reasons I have stayed with Spotify!",5
Spotify is the best,5
I already subscribed to your spotify premium and still not working or opening to my device. I already emailed that I was having a hard time opening your app. Please fix spotify,1
easy app and keeps making new playlists for me. i enjoy it alot.,5
Because this app have so many ads and also some songs are not.,4
"Complete garbage. They have no IT/software team. Most buggy, nonfunctional app I have ever used. Free version might be worth it but do not give them money. They just cash it in instead of developing.",1
Horrible interface with tons of bugs.,1
The app was perfect when I downloaded it.It was very fun to use.After somedays of using it shuffles the song automatically.And it plays random songs that I don't want to hear.I can't play the song that I want to listen.It was a great app.But after this problem started I am getting irritated.And I tried to redownload it.And it still has the issue. So I don't even wanted to give a star.Just the problem nothing else.,1
Awesome music awesome app 😎✨💚🐏,5
I love to listen to the music and podcasts.,5
"I don't want to see ""shows to try"" or ""episodes for you"" podcasts first in the front page. I really dislike the recommendations, often grotesque and straight up unamusing, so I would never, ever use Spotify to listen to podcasts. I don't pay premium for letting you shove those horrible shows at the beginning of the front page, I'm paying to have my MUSIC ad free.",1
The app was so easy to use and the selection of songs fit my taste in music I recommend it to anyone looking for the songs of your choice,5
When it come to music I really love to use this application very much good 👍,5
"It provides best music quality than any other app, as it is more essential for good music experience. It has millions of songs and podcasts. So just enjoy listening music on Spotify. 😉☺",4
Enjoy listening to my favourite old songs,4
"I've been paying for my premium only for me not to enjoy adds free and download,really disappointed",1
"Let me stop autoplay when connecting to car bluetooth! It's not accessible. I want to hear my GPS without having to pause playback multiple times. Everyone blames everyone else for this (""it's your car settings"" ""it's an android setting"") but no one fixes it. Google apps can toggle ""allow external devices to start playback"" but that doesn't fix Spotify. Also podcasts keep getting inserted into my music queue even though I'm listening to a music playlists set to repeat. Keep them separate.",2
"I'm sick of it, Spotify, please stop adding songs to Play lists. I get. You want us to try something new but it's getting annoying",1
"I don't know what is wrong with the app, it was fine till I updated my phone software. It is okay if I listening through my laptop, I think the trouble was not my account but the app itself. I rely on Spotify to listening music. I hope I can still use the app by phone since I use the app most of the time in it.",4
The app requires updates too frequently. For the cost it should be more reliable.,3
Love my Spotify App!!,5
"Went over to amazon music, complete trash, it was like a wish purchase compared to this",5
"I like this app very much , but MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT : I THINK IT'S VERY STUPID THAT YOU HAVE TO SKIP TO YOUR FAVORITE SONG AND ALSO THAT YOUR SONG THAT YOU SEARCH IS SHUFFLED WITH OTHER SONGS!!!!!!",4
I am a die hard spotify fan... but with the new update. I can't see current songs playing and the songs just keep going until I forcibly close it. Kinda sucks.,3
"Personalized listening experiences, I love the collaborative playlists!",5
Rubbish I don't know if it updated or something but you can't play a specific song anymore,1
"Not much interested, getting lots of advertisements",2
"Edited: Reading through the reviews, just wondering has this company been sold to a venture capitalist? Everyone's mad at u guys. I'm sorry, I usually don't do this, but I have to edit my excellent rating I gave this app. Last few days have just been really bad. Right now I can't see my currently playing song. My queued up songs and that's making it difficult to use the app. Kindly correct this and I'm happy to return my previous excellent rating. Thanks . . . . . . Simply awesome 😊👌🏿",1
"Love Spotify generally, but reading reviews I've been suffering a problem that many others are experiencing. Function bar disappearing, not allowing me to pause etc, also affects pausing using my headphones. Music keeps stopping on its own accord. It is so frustrating!!!",2
"Horrible push towards paid premium, nothing but continuous ads one after each and every song played. Very limited 30 minute free plays if any and now it won't let me use my 6 free skips or it makes my phone skip a song without me touching it. (As of July 2022) makes previously privated playlists public, can't delete old playlists no matter how often I press the button, constantly exiting out of app, just awful.",1
"Computer version is much better and has a repeating option. On phone app it doesn't work. You can pick the song you wanna hear instead of random, unlike the app",3
"There are sooo many problems with Spotify, maybe because I use an android but it keeps on saying that there are connection problems and not letting me access anything, please find a way to allow other android users to make full use of this app",1
I am facing issue with the app as my wifi and data everything is working it still shows you are offline everytime. I tried troubleshooting but nothing happens.,1
my favourite music streaming platform!,5
Love it. Great selections very extensive library found a lot of my favorites.,5
Much more reliable than Amazon Prime Music and a far bigger choice of music,5
So much good music app good performance and my favourite song is Sigma,4
The ads are disturbing but the overall experience is nice,4
My dudes i love you but i now cant listen to music when my phones locked. Please fix and ill change rating,1
"Terrible experience for listening to podcasts, it never remembers last played position of a podcast, it doesn't sink between devices..i.e. my computer and phone.",1
"Laggy, not as good as it was previous versions. I'm not a fan of the new changes, plus it won't let access songs when I'm offline, when half the time I'm just on cellular. Edit: still having the same problems since may 2022...why have none of the updates fixed these basic problems? I've mostly switched to a different podcast player, but still looking for a good alternative music player.",2
"Updated rating 7/8/22: the app has become unreliable. Podcasts stop for no apparent reason, especially when screen becomes idle. I installed the app on a different phone with a bigger memory, but this app still stops. Fix your damn app, Spotify.",1
Excellent app - can find almost anything,5
"It's a great app for listening music, I have playlists I've made as profile Cheetah345 with probably thousands of songs. I have few complaints other than the fact that premium is just expensive enough that as a teenager with not much income I can't afford to spend that much. Unfortunately you are pushing a political agenda with ads that I am sick of. Every time I listen anymore every single ad is for pro gay junk. I don't want ads for that. It's gotten so bad I can't even use this app anymore",3
I build lists of the music I love and explore new music without limits. This is my best music buy in years.,5
Me and my daughter love Spotify it's one of our most used apps,5
I really like this app I can find music I haven't heard in decades man I can listen for hours thanks for having a damn good app,5
"Play bat keeps disappearing. can't pause/play or change the song. Sometimes it won't even play a song after selecting it multiple times. Constantly freezing, can't even pause with my headphones when that happens. I have to completely close the app and restart it for it to start working.",1
Such a rubbish app lots of advertisements i m going to uninstall this app ..,1
Just had to sit through 6 adds straight as a free user only to it to play a completely different song than the one I clicked on.,1
This app is a god damn mess. I pay for glinches apparently.,1
It's not even starting. it only shows the spotify logo. Am I only suppose to see logo in this app??,1
Just recently started to randomly stop playing music or podcasts. Would have to go back into app to press play again.,5
Every time i want to listen to my fave songs i can listen to a few but after like 5 songs it changes to a totally other song,3
When are they going to fix the broken dowload/offline working of spotify.,3
Great 👍 and I look forward to your new drama and the great news 😀 👍 😄 😊 🙌,5
"I found this app was intresting. Easy to use... Urge to improve: I use lyrics as full screen, then i switched on another app. When songs changed, i switched back. Lyrics's screen turn to error, keep showing prev lyric.",4
Could not function with my music! Great app,5
Best music streaming app ever! 👌👏,5
Great app brilliant music the best,5
Its a very nice app...with interesting songs🥰🥰just try it,5
I'm new to this Spotify and I really like it,5
Always there are bugs and glitches it always exit the app when I lock my screen,1
Other music apps have an offline feature where it allows you to download some certain music for free but it's otherwise here .,3
SPC 3008roblox Yes we can do that for you and the family have car Roblox I have to be in touch with you to see what you look and see what I have a few questions about your free time to get a new phone and I will be there in touch to let you can get a hold of the sky is not a good,5
Works great. And actually helps me find new artist,5
"The latest update ruined it. Crashes, controls disappear, won't switch to online after offline, and more.",2
I love Spotify. I can find anytjing I want to liaten to. They have any genre I want or if I want a podcast they have it!,5
The App is amazing but the newest update has been quite Annoying. When I'm trying to play my playlist it always goes to some recommended songs which I can't skip.,2
"I love this app, but if feels like it will never improve... sometimes it just glitches and refuses to play and you have to exist and enter again... if you try to listen at the same time with friends there's a delay between when you hear the song and they do... even to this day they haven't brought listening activity to mobile... like just have it as a tab that you can open if you want to... there are so many things they could add, but they just don't... such a shame...",3
Very good app all genres and era of music Gave 4 stars not that there is an issue just that there is always room for some unknown improvement,4
Omg 😍😍my fav app ever. It has really good quality💋🥂,5
"Clearly, this is an amazing app qith the best quality, the only thing i dont pike is that they dont offer all songs, but mist every app has this situation or maybe a worse one. So please, go ditch ur pandora and join spotify, it ia so worth it.",5
I have lost the ability to pause and skip songs on the app.,2
My favorite app for music 100%,5
Been using it for years. Never had any problems. Pretty good library.,5
I really love to listen to my music I love,5
I enjoy every music from Spotify,5
Does the touch of my hand work? I can't change the song? An annoying app.,1
Great app find all songs i like and new ones but tired of being double charged for the premium package about to uninstall,3
"It's a very good app for music...loved it a lot.. but today when I'm trying to open the app it's not working even after reinstallation, it's still not opening. Please fix the glitch",3
this is fantastic app for old and newsing for singing,5
The 'What's playing' facility has disappeared. The most basic feature - gone. Not good enough.,1
"I love your music ..thank you so much for sharing this ,great job..",5
Excellent music app,5
Works but feels rough and clitchy. Unbelievable that such a big brand like Spotify cannot make an app thats well intrgrated with a premium android device. This should be a AAA title. I'm using GalaxyS20 and constantly have issues with simple stuff. Like pausing the music or controlling the app through galaxyBuds. Often freezes and music stays playing in the background with no way of turning it off other than hard closing the app. AndoidAuto experience is even worse.,2
"Thanks for dumping all my downloads without even telling me! Appreciate that! I also love how when I don't have cellular reception, you won't let me play the podcasts that I already downloaded. I also love how as time goes on the more glitchy and unreliable the app becomes. Thanks for letting me down, Spotify!",1
Not happy with the hey Spotify thing. I don't like it taking away my control while I'm in a vehicle.....or maybe this is just a bug.,2
Logedin on my family premium plane to listen to music on plan flight and loged out wen u landed and I now just can't get in I have uninstalled it 3 times and it won't work,2
Lots of good music but lots of adds,4
Continually riddled with issues. Currently it will just quit playing on me. It does not seem like Spotify truly cares about customers through my experience I have continually felt ignored in that the issues are generally left unresolved for an excessive amount of time... Awesome to know it wasn't just my device because I just upgraded to the s22 ultra and the issues are still here with liked song filters like I've complained about for months,1
"The music options are great, podcasts are great, but functionally it doesn't work half the time. You play a song and there is a bug that causes the app not to show the pause and play buttons. They don't reappear until I restart my phone. Have to force close the app to stop playing anything. Can't skip any songs. Really an app breaking bug.",2
Better than the other satellite radio station offered. I like that you can customize your music. I have the premium subscription with no advertising great option.-,5
"This app is great, if you are reading this you definitely need to download it",5
Still garbage. If I wasn't so deep into creating my library using Spotify I would use a different app. Constantly have to redownload everything for absolutely no discernable reason. App closed and reopened? Guess you're downloading your entire library for the third time this week.,1
"I prefer free coz it always drive me crazy when i m choosing e wallet payment methode, gopay or telkomsel, all the same...",2
"I'm giving this two stars for no other reason that Spotify intentionally screws over desktop users by denying them important features which are ONLY on the app. Why can't I block artists on desktop? Why force me to use the app? I'd use it anyway, but making me HAVE to is just kinda butts.",2
I pay money for this every month and it is garbage. I've loved Spotify for years. Now they can't get it right. I'm seriously about to end my subscription and switch.,1
"This is mony app no install this app, wink is best and gana is best app😒😒",1
doesn't go past the loading page,1
The free trial is great and when thats over there are only a few adds that x o me between you are your music.😁😊👌🤌🤟👍,4
"WOW MANY SONG DJ, ROCK,ROMANTIC, WOW THIS IS SO SUPER APP",5
"I've been using YouTube Music for 3 years but a few days ago I bought Spotify premium edition to see which one is better, To be honest Spotify has better playlists so it's a better app to find your new songs that you like but YouTube Music has a part that mixes songs for you but it changes every week so I think it's not good as Spotify is, But to be honest again YouTube Music has a better design for its app and if you won't spend money for Music application YouTube music's free edition is better",4
"Worst audio quality in the market. It's more a social network, if you really like music this is not your app.",1
Everything's fine about Spotify but the shuffle option often repeats tracks. Please improve shuffle option,4
Very poor when offline,1
"This app is the best music app I have ever seen but there are some covers which are not here like ""Sure thing"" by BLACKPINK and ""Clarity"" by Jisoo...Pls update those in the app...other then this everything is awesome ❤️❤️❤️",5
I used this and it was the best app for music,5
Crashes on android everytime I go full screen. I thought this was a mature app? Where is quality control?,3
"App is terrible. It always errors out, crashes, fails to display a toggle bar for whatever you are listening to in order to pause or skip ahead. How can such a big company have such an awful platform.",1
It's easy to safe and play my favorite tunes. I have been able to hear and save everything that I requested to listen to.,5
App is good but had lot of trouble logging in once logged out,3
I've been using Spotify since I first started using a phone. I can bear with the ads and everything but for some reason recently the music would just stop when I went to other apps and I'd have to start the song from the beginning again. It happened a couple times and I thought that it's okay but it's been happening so much recently its really getting on my nerves,3
Ads are more I am not interested in this app i am deleting it,1
Love using Spotify for whatever I like to listen to. Everything about it is AMAZING!! NO faults.,5
Spotify continues to surprise me with the depth of music available - always uplifts my day!,5
"Love the app, have had it for years, but I just got a new phone (Galaxy S22), and since then when I use Spotify, my queue doesn't pop up when I start listening, I can't pause or go back and forward in any podcast or song/playlist. Obviously this is annoying if you want to check how long is left on a podcast or song, or missed something that was said now can't hear again without starting over, or worse needing to pause for a variety of reasons. Please fix",3
User friendly and makes good suggestions,5
"Highly Recommended. Mostly all the songs available, but, I wish there was some sort of thing in which we could request the songs we wanted to have but, overall it's actually way more better than any other music streaming app I've ever used. The ads are just a misconception. The ads are never TOO MUCH or back to back. They come occasionally which I guess is pretty tolerable for anyone who's not using the premium. Keep up with the good job.",5
Easy to use able to find the music I enjoy,5
"The app will not even open anymore. I logged out and since then it stays at the loading screen. I've tried reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, even tried waiting it out. Nothing. Just a big logo that never goes away.",1
Good application for listening music and podcast,5
"It's a fun app, lots of diversity options.",5
"I am seriously considering looking for another music streaming aap. For weeks player keeps vanishing. Can't control this aap, pause or stop playing. It's not free application. This is ridiculous.",1
This is a very good service for laptops and desktops but the new updates are totally ruining the experience for mobile users and making it horrible. There used to be a kebab menu (three dots) icon whenever you searched a song which allowed you to add it to a playlist directly. Now you must play the song before adding it to a playlist because the three dots disappeared. Also mobile users don't have the option of rearranging the songs on a playlist. Please resolve these issues ASAP.,3
Compare as ganna Spotify is 10000%best i really love it !! Best app,5
Just let me view the creators songs not recommended songs. It's so annoying.,3
"An offline version should be developed, Meanwhile the app is nice,appreciated.",2
There is a 30 second advertisement after each song and it is very irritating.,2
Cut the ads Good ...........🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺,1
"WAYYY to restricting! This app annoys me because its literally Forcing me to buy premium. I shuffle in my playlist and it plays a completely different song i havent put in my playlist Its so annoying that i have to shuffle in order to get the song i want to play cause if i click a song, it doesn't even play it. I dont even get the song i wanna play! I only get 6 skips per hour and the updates they make are a HUGGEEE downgrade. Im done with this app.",1
"I only really use this app for podcasts. I still don't understand why it will stop my current episode and then go to a random one. It's very annoying, happens daily.",2
"Need a mental piece of mind but this app would let me. The ads are pretty annoying, talks about Spotify premium all the time like I would purchase. If I did then it will be over my dead body. Deleting the app. Sayonara #crapapp",1
The suggestion according to my mood is amazing.,4
It did work at first then after a bit it started to play up I tryed unstalling it and installing it again and again and it still wouldn't work I really enjoy the app its just playing up so I just stoped using it,3
Best streaming online music app.,5
I don't know if a bug or not u can open the app but just the logo that u can see I bin waiting for hours bat I can go to the app,1
"Queue does not work, it seems it only queues the last song you added to the queue.",3
Recently the app just seems to randomly stop and start playback. Often I have to restart the app because none of the playback tools work (it seems to be stuck on playing something) and this playback continues across everything else.,3
this app is useless! so many times listening a podcasts and suddenly stopped and can't play it back until restart my phone and so many other issues that u don't expect from a company that big shame on you spotify really.,1
It gives me a different song instead of playing what I wanted.,2
This app sucks bcs the bug pls fix it when i tried to play something but the song is wrong,1
Application isn't working with wifi,3
"I Just Love this app!! It is the absolute 💯 best music streaming service!! It allows you to create your own Playlist and will make one for you according to your taste. And has all the oldies, 80's, 90's and many Genres of music. Let's you get up close with the artist without all these hidden fees and Agenda!! And absolutely no commercials which makes me extremely happy!! Now if we could stream our favorite artist on tour or in concert and be able to see and listen live in our homes.😁😁",5
Love Spotify it's the best,5
"broken app, no more 30 mins of uninterrupted listening",3
"I hate that i can't listen to what I want. I can't choose a song, and I have to wait and listen to the whole playlist to hear song i want. I also hate limited skips and how Spotify itself puts songs on my playlists. The sound quality is really good but you have to fix somethings",3
ads more than songs,1
Its a good app for music but the ads 😅 they are very annoying 😡 but I just bought a premium membership just a request give download option for free users,4
Really a superb app but i give only 3 stars because there are one advertisement at a single song.so kindly avoid it,3
"it always playing a few songs and 3 ads, and I don't know why",5
Awesome experience on Spotify!,5
Add ability to better control volume when playing to Alexa speaker groups with multiple echos devices. Stop paying for Joe Rogans misinformation.,2
Good until you plays the song I didn't like. Can't even switch to other song.,1
i just downloaded and it's stuck on the screen with the logo. fix this please! I haven't even logged on :'(,1
"Love the app, always have. However, it's been nothing but issues recently. The ""now playing"" info doesn't show. So I can't pause or skip music. It also stops randomly and I have to close the app and go back in and press play again to start over the playlist since I can't just continue with no ""now playing"" bar.",3
This update is horrible when i play the music i want it puts a random song please remove this update and make people listen music in peace!,1
Excellent app for music lovers,5
I open the app just wont load so I can login why is that ?,1
"I am a paid subscriber and have been using Android OS for >12 years; I know all the tricks. I cannot control the app or terminate a group session - none of the controls are working, even after stopping it from the OS app manager, clearing cache and data, and re-signing in. Unacceptable for a paid app.",2
Overall the app is pretty good except that its a bit confusing on a phone rather than on a laptop. I also don't like how on a phone you can't choose what song you want to play from your playlist and you only get to hear a snippet of the song. Please change this because it comes to a very big disadvantage for people who do not wish to purchase premium.,3
"Hi there, I have uninstall this app in my handphone and i have check play store there is also no spotify app in my account.. Why do i still have to pay for the subscription fees? Able to assist please. Thank you.",1
Best music app so far. I am a premium customer.,5
"After the update, Spotify doesn't load. It is stuck on the logo. I hope there is an immediate response regarding this issue. Thank you.",2
I love Spotify! I use this app everyday!🥰,5
I'LL FU KING DONT UNDERSTAND HIW TO USE SPOTIFY NOW!!!!I LIKE THE OLD ONE.WHY U CHANGE IT? DONT DOWNLOAD GUYS..IF I CAN GIVE ZERO STAR I WILL GIVE ZERO STAR!!!!!!I HATE THISS PLEASE CHANCE IT BACK BC WHEN I WANT TO PLAY THE MUSIC..NOT THE MUSIC WILL COME OUT!!!! I LOVE SONG AND I HATE SPOTIFY FOR NOW,1
Bad due to ads at sevral time,1
Too too too much ads.,1
Whenever I hear an ad on Spotify I vow I will never use that product,2
"Absolutely excellent,I love it. It's j my acception.",5
Love it. You guys have built an excellent app. Moving music with new microultrasoundlowfreq waves would the next. Tesla would be proudly your sponsor. Congrats,5
"Good, Superb & Excellent music app",5
"Can't listen to songs offline, you need premium, other then that it's good.",1
Same songs keep repeating,3
Spotify music app is very useful to attract people makes them for relation and happy. 🎤🎻🎹🎧🇨🇳🧧👘🐉,5
Normally would've given this app 5 stars but I didn't because of the following reason: -Apps are supposed to be better than the web version but not with this app. The shuffle option is very frustrating to deal with when you just want to listen to one song on mobile. You'll have to go through multiple songs just to listen to the one song you wanted to listen to. What doesn't make sense is why I don't have this issue on my tablet but I do on my phone. Can't loop either. Please fix this issue.,3
"Easier to use than Pandora for sure, the skip limit on here is bigger too",4
I have downloaded this app about three times now and I can just log in or sign up..it keeps telling me am offline or try again even though I have strong network connection... This is not good at all,1
Randomly stops playing and doesn't show the controls at the top bar. Very glitchy in the last year,3
"Hello I'm currently having an issue where I couldn't log into my spotify. I don't even know what the problem is but the screen become all black whenever I open the Spotify app. I enjoy using Spotify so much and I open it everyday. I even subscribe to the premium plan. However, now I cannot use this Spotify and I chose to use the Lite version. PLEASE fix this problem for me :'(",2
Awesome love the app and enjoy the playlists,5
"Nice apps, but too expensive to get the premium",4
Extremely glitchy and buggy. Never had an inuse intil last week. will not let me pause music go forward to the next song fast forward rewind and will will not open the media player. I have no control. Debating switching to Apple music,1
Very easy interface and not glitchy at all work great in old device but the musics dont have high bass. at some point there is no bass at where it should be other than great app,5
"1 minute ad after every 2 songs (sometimes even 1 song) it's unacceptable! To be specific, 2 Disney+ ads, each of 30 seconds. And it's July, stop putting Christmas songs in Daily Mixes! What's wrong with you people?!? 🙄",1
This app aint working on my phone i redownloaded the app but still broken Idk what happened,1
Love the app Like my choices to listening to my favorites,4
THIS IS THE BEST STREAMING APP EVER tho before when I downloaded Spotify and I played a song it plays another song it was actually dumb Which made me move to yt but I came back again and it was gone :D so mabey this problem still exists for others so I would recommend trying to fix that,4
This app has gone from good to worse I listen to one song and I get 5 to 6 advertisements at a time it's ridiculous nobody should download this app anymore,1
"it was good, but i think spotify duo package is kinda useless, well i meant the terms to lived in the same house kinda stupid for duo, well of course it make sense for family but duo? not every couple lived or always lived in the same house.",4
One of the best app to listen to music And personally I have listings to ads inbetween :),5
It's not opening up I have tried many times some days ago when I used to search for a song it would show no network but my network was all fine 😞 then I reinstalled the app but now it's not opening up at all it used to work all perfect but now don't know what happened pls ans me ??????,1
You cant so alot on ur phone i was trying to listen to my favorites and it wouldnt let me u can also not go back to the previous song,2
"Pathetic experience !!!!! I uninstalled this app after 1 or 2 weeks only.. you can't even play the music of your own choice, and you cannot even change the music when u want! I mean wth???! They charge for everything... You have to pay for everything , huh, Lol... There are easy and free alternatives, i mean why would we use this app and pay for it...",1
What's there to not love about Spotify?,5
"Hello! I am 50 years young, and I came from a very poor family background, grew up in the country, so we, (of course),...didn't have the money to just go out and buy new technology like some people. (70s-80s), That being said, ....anyone that can relate to this review?,....,probably had to save their allowance for a couple of weeks to go buy vynl records....etc.BOTTOM LINE!...Spotify on any smartphone beats! The old vynl when you couldn't afford to do that and keep your music too! THANKS!",5
Thank goodness for Spotify.,5
Excellent condition and very good apps,5
i cant open my spotify it only shows the logo once i click the app. it's almost a week now i hope this will get fixed,1
Easy to navigate & share between devices. But it doesn't always play videos,4
This app is really good but sometimes there are not lyrics :(,4
Latest version has major issues on pixel 6. Now playing no longer works only way to stop is to force close the app. Virtually unusable. How can I roll back?,1
Amazing app just wish we could go download the song is without fear premium,4
"when I request for a particular album it won't play all the songs there it will just play like 5 in the albulm and start playing songs I didn't request for but of the same artist and also since I updated the app I if I search for a particular song I can't play it immediately I have too b listening to songs dat are of different artist or the same artist sometimes b4 it plays d requested song, I am tired of the app already.",1
"Usually love Spotify, but for as long as I can remember the app randomly stops playing a song then anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes I will start playing again... Does this at least 5-10 times per song.... Infuriating... Especially when you're having a sing along in the car and the song randomly stops playing... And you're not a great singer.... Please fix!",4
I really love Spotify music,1
"Whenever I make a playlist, that means I want to listen to the songs I put there. Not random songs that Spotify give me and don't even let me skip",1
"Always loved spotify, I pay for the no ads subscription. My life without music would suck and spotify gives me the joy",5
Great UI so far,2
"Super buggy since the last update: doesnt show whats playing, pauses randomly, wont let me change podcast episodes, and to fix it i uninstall it and the problems come back within an episode or two. This needs to be fixed or ill have to switch to a different podcast service because its becoming unusable.",1
Great app! Surprisingly Amazing!,5
So manyyyy ads 😐😐,2
Spotify is the best app i ever used i felt that spotify is connect with my soul and heart what ever my mood is spotify play that type of songs for me😍 i love spotify❤,4
Honestly it's the worst music app that I've ever had on my phone it plays every song except yours you bacicaly have to have premium or you can't listen to your own songs,1
too much advertising during listning songs 😬,1
They are really good and they also have a premium plan for 4.99 I use the family plan spotify has every song you would like.,5
Spotify is awesome,5
Easy to use.. and all the song and artist is almost available.,5
Good for listening on headphones!,4
"Please change back the old insta story design, the new bold font design is so ugly. At least let us choose what design we want when sharing to insta story.",3
"This last update completely destroyed the app. Why do you keep adding pointless things that aren't needed? It's breaking the foundation of the app. When I play music now, it doesn't show up at the bottom of the screen or on my lock screen, it's like I never even played the song. And then after 10 minutes it just cuts out for no reason and I have to go back to the app. I can't even listen to music for no reason. Sort it out",3
Selections of songs & sounds crispy 👌,5
"This app frustrated me to the point that I cried. I want a SPECIFIC song, and I click the song only to get fifty that I either hate, or are completely unrelated. I have to wait for hours to skip to that song because I'm not paying for premium. You should at least be able to pick a certain song in a playlist, and please get rid of the random bots messing with your playlist, it basically says ""your playlist is the worst"" to your face. I made the playlist to get a specific song dude, stop!",1
"Omg this new update where everything is changed, I can't select a individual song off an album or any of my playlists. This update needs to be better or completely vanish",1
"Love the app, only wish it had playback speed like YouTube has, a good few songs that I ha e sound a lot better at a certain speed. How this could get fixed in the next update please and thank you.",5
I would love an option to rename playlists on android mobile,4
I used to be able to make playlists and get previews of songs suggested me but they got rid of that like how am i supost to know what song it is seriously yall needa fix this because if it isnt fixed soon im going to use a diffrent app this is ridiculous,1
Can't turn off shuffle,1
Was great until a few weeks ago? Have used the app for years but now keeps crashing everytime I open on desktop? Have tried just about every suggestion available to fix - nothing helps. Am about to cancel my subscription.,1
"Amazing, until hacked. But thats life I guess",5
My player stopped working with the app I'll play a podcast and it stopped please fix asap,3
Can't figure out how to sign in to my family plan and merge both Spotify's,3
"the best music library streaming app ever. please DO NOT break it here we are, 2022. it's broken. the lyric engine/algorithm worked, now it's a laugh. lyrics incomplete and wrong...",1
Great app! I can listen to deftones sure! Only problem which has just occurred for some reason is where it keeps playing random songs? Like I'm trying to play my Playlist and then after the top first song it plays another song that was never added to my liked songs? Never played it on spotify either. If this problem can be fixed please! And I mean please fix this!!,4
"I have the premium version, I like it but when I'm conecting my JBL speaker the sound is interrupted and it's not great sounding",4
"App stability is getting worse, happens across multiple devices very frustrating.",2
Well I loved it at 1st... Then after trouble I had to contact you guys... 1 st few times was good then the last few times I was wondering if the folks I was talking to even had a clue... after being told twice I would have to manually download my whole list again I threatened to Terminate... Then decided to try one more time and was able to get all my songs back with ZERO HELP FROM YOUR TECH SUPPORT... I'm still in the fence about leaving...,3
Best app for music .,5
"I don't know if it's just me, but whenever I have another app open Spotify randomly stops, making me have to go to the app to get my music back, and whatever song it was on, even if it almost done, restarts. Other then that, spotify is great for listening to music, or podcasts!",4
Once again Spotify isn't working properly. Sort it!,1
The app has been VERY glitchy the last 2 days. A developer needs to look at it.,3
Blank screen with Spotify logo is appearing and nothing is happening. Uninstalled and reinstalled it but it's the same nothing changed.,1
"I love it. I can hear my music whenever I want to without interruptions. Thank you,for all you do.",5
solid experience while using this app much appreciated!,5
I'm going out with a knee problem but the most important thing is that the one I was thinking about you all day tomorrow so will have a great time and effort into it would have to do with a knee problem but the most important thing is that the one I was thinking about you all day tomorrow so will have a great time 5th and effort into it would have to do with a knee problem but the most important thing is is is is is is is is is is is that the one,5
"Buggy as hell. Freezes after an ad. Clean install, cache and data clean cannot make it run. Of ypu cannot write an app that works, don't offer it.",1
Nice relaxing app that keeps improving over time,4
Excellent App. Very enjoyable,5
Too many ads as compared to other music platforms..but yet again less than youtube 🙃🙃,5
I'm having problem with purchasing. It can't be done via voucher. Fix it.,1
3 weeks ago my Spotify all of the sudden stop playing. I emailed Spotify team about it. After 3 weeks my Spotify is back and working again,5
I can't play the songs I select - no matter whether I uninstall or log out and log in again. Extremely frustrating.,1
"The UI is super intuitive, the premium features are cool, it just great overall. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is how it doesn't really pay artist well.",4
First time user - thumbs up! Not sure what it can do yet.,5
"I can't even open the app anymore. I've been trying to open it for the past two weeks. I tried to re-download it multiple times, but it still won't open for some reason.",1
I am enjoying good music serious nice songs,5
Good but without premium there is a lot of ads and I can't listen to the song I want,4
Great app for old-fashioned listeners,5
Highly refreshing entertainment... top notch tunes to the max,5
This is the best app for listen music I was ever seen,5
"Recent update broken With this last update I have been unable to access any music. It won't play anything. It doesn't allow me to even play downloaded, or even show my music or podcasts. Fabulous, back to not sleeping well. Upset because it's been fine for years. And now that I rely on the stories and mediations to sleep, now it decides to not work at all.",1
I enjoy all the podcasts,5
Plays songs that aren't even on the the liked song playlist and just litters it with songs from genre you don't even like listening. Good luck listening to something like metal because you'll get forced to listening to love songs for lonely people.,1
Spotify you are the best,5
"I love the app, even without premium you still get great music options and an awesome experience! 10/10 recommend!!",5
I really enjoy Spotify. I make my own playlist. put my ear buds on and get lost in my music thanks Spotify yall rock 🎸,5
I logged out of my account now when i open it it stays on the loading screen my wifi isnt even the issue bcs spotify lite works good,2
It won't play a podcast for longer than 10 minutes without stopping and I have to restart the app and it's premium,1
"Its really bad now, every time try to pay it always reconet over and over. Enough with spotify.",1
Great song choices.,5
Won't play other songs after clicking the play button and I can't figure out where to turn off shuffle for my liked Playlist.,1
"Well I do got to say had to change my mind at first I thought this site sucks what not and in the end if you do your due diligence you can get back your accounts they're pretty cool you just got a member save save your Everything download whatnot it's just got to be a better way to download it to your SD card and s*** like that when you have 100,000 songs other than that f****** Spotify Spotify hit him up download it and go you guys rock 100%",5
Even though you have to have premium to pick a song it's pretty good,5
"I really enjoy using this app, but I do have one suggestion. I'd love it if we were able to create playlist folders on mobile. It'd make it much easier to look through my library. Still though, wonderful to use! <3",4
l you can't cancel the subscription it gives you the runaround and I had to cancel my debit card over it,1
"I love the music added to this, except it keeps getting rid of some songs, some of them my favorites, but most of all, it makes me happy, especially the lofi.",5
Wonderful music app. I love the new music Spotify finds for me. Thank you.,5
"I like Spotify but when I use the app it tells me I have no play lists and all the play lists have nothing on them but when I use Spotify on the website I have 2 play lists and there is play lists, why is that?",2
Been using spotify for 6 or 7 years and had all together a year or more of premium. Was a great app but now I'm literally getting ads every 2 songs. So I can't recommend it anymore.,2
"Overall, a great application for listening to music 10/10 for that. However the app has some bugs sooo uhhh yeah, I can't even open the app anymore without being stuck on the logo sooo you guys lose points there. 8/10 would recommend.",4
"I love it on my Xbox but the mobile app is poorly formatted and impossible to use, and the limited skips an hour is bs, when you run out you can just change the song manually, and why can't you view the songs on a Playlist as a list of individuals like on xbox, the littoral console with a controller being your only way of control, that's right, the xbox version is better formatted than the mobile peice of junk.",2
Best music streaming service ever!!,5
I love it the best music app thanks,5
"Probably my most used app, I use it every day and have never not used it. Full ratings deserved",5
Spotify is a good music app not that many adds and I would really recommend it to my friends.,4
Great way to find and listen to all types of music and get introduced to new artists. But the fact that I can't listen to the song I want to without buying the premium service is extremely annoying. If you want to ask that serves as customizable radio for yourself this is the one for you.,3
The best app to listen to advertisements,1
A Great experience when you can see the progression of your own music on here flourish you provide a lot for us musicians keep the good work up and fighting for the artists rights and best interest,5
I like the podcasts and I used to listen to audio books on you tube but I think I'll keep listening to spotify,4
Why are literally all of your ads 3x louder than the songs stop,2
"Why this app getting worse! Songs playing and I can't see the player. I can't stop, skip, or do anything. Please fix it.",2
I get to listen to all my favorite bands it's amazing I love it and awesome 😎 too I'm a fan of bands so yeah!,5
"This app is a must but the only thing I don't like it because there's too much of add. After playing one or two music ,there you can hear the sound of the add",3
It works good on pc but on the phone it's garbage.... When i click to play a song it automatically shuffles to another song that i did not click on... No way you can take off the shuffle at all so i had to uninstall it...,1
"Good selection, not so good app.",2
Always great quality. Always works great.,5
Spotify is one of the best music apps on this planet! There are absolutely NO ads! Nothing gets in the way of Spotify's music!,5
"Haven't used this app for a very long time and I don't followed any changes, but before I was able to listen one song, I had to watch 8 (!) ads. Like 3 X 30 seconds and 5 X 15 seconds ad. The song was shorter than those ads",1
"Best music app ever, I used to spend 100 bucks a month on CDs but now 9.99 is all and the best part is that this app finds great new music I would never have found! I LOVE YOU SPOTIFY ""PLATONIC OF COURSE""!",5
"Great music app, premium is a must.",5
"The heart button doesn't work, so I can't add songs to my liked songs",1
"Go to choice for podcasts and music, good app.",5
"Recent update needs urgent bug fix!! Control bar missing, music glitches when I turn off phone screen or navigate apps, and sometimes my phone will just start playing randomly now. I don't know what you guys did, but a quick fix would be to just restore an update to last patch. Love Spotify but can't use (or want to pay for) an app like this....",2
When I clicked on the songs I wanted to hear it sometimes puts other songs but overall it has all my favorite songs so yeah idk lol I still recommend it to a lot of people,4
"It keeps on turning my music off as well as changing to music that's not even in my playlists. Me giving it one star might be a bit harsh but, I would like to listen to the music I choose otherwise what's the point of a playlist.",1
"The app isn't working on my phone anymore (Samsung A20). It was working just fine before the more recent update, but now all the playlists are empty and I can't play a single song (and no, I don't have offline mode turned on).",1
"Okay, I have a membership so I don't have any ads but my Spotify app on my phone wasn't working well. It wasn't showing something was playing and would stop in the middle of something.",4
"Ot was good until they started musically profiling me using radio wave brainwave frequency mindhacking devices. Now, all if the lyrics are different than the artist's and it's nerve wracking..",3
I couldn't open my Spotify account anymore!,5
You're better off paying for youtube music. There is no way to cancel your account/subscription if you forgot any credentials like a password or user name. Have sent them several emails to attempt to cancel since you can't call them but there is no way to cancel because they say they can't find my account but they are charging me for it.,1
I switched to Spotify after Google discontinued play music and haven't regretted it.,5
Seems like the random stopping of music has been fixed.thank you! And also people If you can accept what's included on the free spotify aspotify app just upgrade And stop complaining!!,4
"I love this app. However, recently it's been glitchy. I can't control the songs. The control features are gone. The app stops. Please fix soon.",1
Pretty awesome... I get to listen to music and stuff. You have to have premium if you don't wanna listen to ads every other song.,4
So convenient and easy to use,5
Very nice But innum songs add panuga,5
Continuing to say no internet connection.. with full bars. All other apps working.,1
I would have given it a 5out of 5 but not bc it don't let me replay a song,4
Spotify app has been kept abruptly freezing and unstable in my One plus 9R device. Requesting team to look into the same. It's more guess because of the recent OS update by one plus,3
"Great app, although it can be glitchy at times. Paying for premiums so worth it.",5
"What's happened? I've been using Spotify for years with no problems. But now podcasts keep randomly pausing, and the control bar has disappeared so I can no longer easily play and pause, or use the sleep function. This app isn't cheap and with this reduced functionality I feel I'm getting a poor deal.",2
"The worst app I've ever used, ads all the time and a lot of them, six skips AN HOUR plus not being able to play any song you like you have to listen to a whole Playlist in a random order with a few songs you were actually looking for, I also constantly run into problems that span across four phones and a laptop so it isn't my device, another limitation is listening on only one device at a time and it takes a little to switch, the only thing I use it for is listening to podcasts which isn't bad",1
"I always used to like this app and it was my favourite app to listen music or podcasts to, but lately I can't really download anything even though I have plenty of storage left and the app keeps on stopping. I deleted the app multiple times and restarted my phone but nothing works and after the last update everything just got worse.",1
Excellent service with all chromecast devices,5
"It's ok, but $10/month is too much to pay, especially knowing how little the artists actually get out of that money.",1
"I will only rate 5 if you include option ""Set Music As"" Ringtone, Alarm Tone and Message Alert tone. Edit: I'm lowering my rating more because it's annoying that it doesn't have option to remove a certain song directly from my playlist. I still need to get out and find the song to remove it instead of it being available when you click the 3 dots.",2
"Great app, just wish there were cheaper plans bc when your a kid and dont make bank and you want to listen to music...you dont really have the funds to give up 10 dollars a month...I know it doesn't sound like a lot but if you think about it, you not ""getting"" anything, you are enjoying music, and I guess you can just use the default like I do but it is just limiting. The app itself is great and has huge options and good quality, not glitchy and is great!",4
Worst song app because it's have an add in between of songs so worst,1
"So far so good .... Came over from another streaming service and its only the first billing month , I have had no problems and the library is much better, lots more podcast to choose from and .... I dont even miss Neil Young ✌",5
"This is a bad app. Resso is much better than Spotify. A song is repeated over and over again. I wanted to give it zero star, but There is no system for that. I'm uninstalling it.",1
All previous comments been covered. Started off brilliant under premium plan. Now ads coming fast as. I didn't pay to listen to ads & lose playlists etc. I'm canceling subscription.,2
The app won't even launch on my phone Just keeps showing the Spotify logo I'm disappointed,1
Very good app but so many ads,5
Spotify is the perfect name....spotty at best. I cant believe how many times the app plays music and sometimes it just doesnt want to. Mix that with zero phone support and fix the problem is a joke. I pay for this service for way to long now it just doesnt work at all. Ive looked at all forums and nothing has fixed the problem.,1
"Recently I've been having issues with my mobile app, sometimes a song will play but the profile of that song will be a different song, it's laggy. I normally fixed the issue by restarting my phone or updating my spotify app. My most annoying issue though is that I can't even open my mobile app anymore, it just leaves me on the black loading splash screen page with the green logo but never loads. It kinda sucks right now considering I pay for premium. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10",3
"Best app to listen to music, unfortunately some of the rarest song & artist that i was looking forward to listen sometime not available 😢",4
"Still buggy but functional. I still see bugs that are really confusing and frustrating. Beyond that, it's alright. Shuffle doesn't work properly. Will improve rating with further bug fixes and shuffle improvement",3
"I'm having the same issues as some of the last reviews, Spotify keeps pausing 3-4 times a song. It's very frustrating and I've starting using another service. Hopefully they can get this problem resolved asap.",3
It's bad it doesn't let you pick your own song. It's so confusing,1
I spoke with customer service for hours about an issue I was having and the final conclusion was that the issue was with my phone model. If you have issues that are specific to a device you should clearly market it as such if you aren't going to fix it.,1
One of the best music app,4
"My go to music app, first started using it years ago because no connection was needed to hear my playlists and I have never strayed.",5
I find every song every time,5
Damn My profile picture was in my Spotify and click man I love the playlist thank you so much,5
Excellent at guessing what kind of music I'd like to hear next. Always a great listening experience.,5
"Every song you've heard and more is on here, however, 1 BIG ISSUE, when I enter the app it will say ""nothing playing"" when there is very much something playing and it will play in the background but I can't control it at all from my notification bar",4
Awesome app that stays up to date with the latest rap and hip hop. My favorite app for music by far.....,5
It is because you don't have the right lyrics for a song,1
Won't show current song playing leaving one to scour the web based on lyrics! So much fun,1
So bad. Ads that will lag your device [S10] and will pop up and start playing random song's at random times. Try YT music and audible The programs MUST be trolling.,1
I don't want to give money just to listen to a specific song,1
Constant crash and video restarts. Instantly connects and plays last video to any Bluetooth device you are connected to,2
I wish that you didn't have to buy a membership to listen to most the songs,4
doesnt save offline to sd card properly,3
very good just wish their were less without having to pay,4
"It's been overall great improvement within couple of years and audio quality is great. The app synchronise between devices perfectly and I love this feature to switch between devices while playing song. I only thing I found weak is song suggestions, though I am using this app from couple of years but still it doesn't recommend or make an auto playlist which I like and groove. Please start using better AI so it can suggest and make better playlist for different users.",4
how do i play a songinstead of a damn playlist..... please.. tell me.... i cant figure out after about an hour,1
Yes it's good cause i like jazz wt all my heart,5
It won't even load and that's very upsetting considering I was charged for it.,1
I might as well just totally discontinue usage of this service. I hope they didn't layoff good staff for high school interns.,5
"As of 7/7, this issue has been resolved. I have changed my review to reflect this change It is normally great, but recently the app has been stopping audio randomly, not letting me pause or fast forward, the pop-up doesn't appear so I can't scroll in the song. I have to close the app to stop the music. While listening to podcasts, the podcast will stop and I will have to start over. Due to bugs in the current update, I'm not able to fast forward to where I was.",5
"Great choice of music, easy to create playlist and music always at my fingertips 💃",5
I am thoroughly enjoying Spotify and the flexibility that I have with this streaming service to create Playlist of my favorite types of music.,5
Spotify music player good app,5
"I've been a long time user of spotify and love the amount and quality of music I can use, but recently it's like I'm paying for nothing. Everytime I try to load my downloaded songs I have to close the app a couple times before it will load. I pay to have the ability to listen offline and am not getting that.",2
I pay for premium and lately its been very aggressive about pausing my music whether im on wifi or data. Its been happening to alot of people ive talked to as well. Please fix it,3
Spotify plays all of my favorite songs 🎵,5
"A must app. But payment issues in Nepal and can we download the lyrics please. Considering these minor things , Spotify is great app to listen to music",5
I gat everything i need right on spotify..,5
You can find just about any song I don't get ads.,5
I would give this app five stars if it dinin't have so many ads,4
New update and a new problem comes up!! Now i can't search for my playlists! Can't queue properly. Uninstalled and reinstalled and it's crashed three times on chromecast in 20 minutes! You guys really are total idiots. And now artists tracks are missing. Utterly useless.,1
Really enjoy the music. No technical problems.,5
I enjoy listening to my music in Spotify but it's kind of dumb to listen to your songs and get an ad interruption durning a song other wise I would've rate a 5 but I give you 3 rating it could be better,3
"Improve feature as like if u right swipe the playlist, they gets queued as well, just like songs",5
"Used for a year, and it's better than Pandora, however.. Missing the most basic feature, play history. This is why I refuse to pay. I use Pandora and Spotify to discover new music, and when I can't look up who just played, whats the point really? Edit: Still broken.",1
Love this versatile option for exploring and enjoying my music choices,5
So many great songs to choose from!!,5
"You guys should add JPop to the main genres on the menu, just as you've added Kpop.",1
"Using this every day, all the time. Subscription is worth it.",5
This app is so hard to navigate on phone if I click a a song a have liked it goes to didn't song I never heard or it might play a demo of the song that is dumb it should play the song,1
"Been a great experience, highly recommend.",5
Great app for finding your favorite music,5
App doesn't even open! Uninstalled it and re downloaded it and nothing still not working !,1
"Use to have beats that then turned in apple music,(which did not like at all) found out about Spotify and do not regret getting it.",5
On my galaxy s22 this app is unreliable at best. Podcasts drop off or the app crashes and I can't stop the track and Spotify doesn't remember were I was inside of the podcast. It's not usable.,1
Excellent choices in music based on my tastes,5
"generally good (Spotify is a great service). removing a star because their team seems generally unwilling to listen to feedback from the user community. just go look at their help forums for tons of examples where an issue is reported, backed up by hundreds of users, but no indication they will work on it. please fix the shuffle algorithm! I have a 40 hour playlist but end up hearing the same songs every day.",4
"Endless issues, stops and/or starts without any reason, plays episodes I didn't request. Frequently stops and won't play at all. It's the worst of all the podcast players I use - I only use it because I can't get Rogan anywhere else. If it wasn't for Joe Rogan and the Dark Horse podcast, I'd dump it in a heartbeat and never miss it.",1
I love the Spotify app. Especially the lyrics feature...I can sing along!,5
Love it!!! Great work out tool also.,5
Definitely a good app for music or podcasts. The premium subscription thing is probably a bit overpriced though.,4
"Nothing. After I registered and pay premium mini I can't play or add, open profile of my account. How it this even possible? Plus daily mox from Spotify aslo marked as empty",2
I love that I can listen to my downloaded music without using my data.,5
I enjoy spotify.every song I want it right here,5
"Love it especially every favorite song i play, especially since I'm a huge music head.",5
UI needs work (by that I mean just a simple feature to be added as to swipe down on the mini player and that ends the song )so far so good tho,4
"Very spotty servers, laggy mobile and desktop apps that crash and hang with no explaination despite top tier hardware. Catalog shrinking due to political and copywrite nonsense.",1
This is the worst podcast player. Everything is harder than it should be.,1
I loved when i downloaded it but after like one week it's forcing to buy the premium version. I can't even play i single song without buying it. It's really annoying! I loved this app & keep wanted to use it but...,4
I don't understand why Spotify needs my mic in order to work. Otherwise I have no trouble with the app.,4
It was a ok app didn't have it that long was use to pandora music playing guess I will try it again some day,3
"Best streaming music and podcast app. Especially if you like discovering new music, this app is for you.",4
"Didn't think I would enjoy spotify, I couldn't have been more wrong. Dr",5
"I have good internet connection , but system keep saying that im not connected Whats wrong with this ? I have same problem everytime i need to buy a premium please fix",1
It's the best music app to listen to your favorites songs,5
Everything works and sounds great.,5
Good stuff on spotify,5
It takes so long just to download,1
Ok so here's the deal Spotify has this new update where they add there recommended songs on there...this is a problem because you come to Spotify yo listen to your Playlist and the music you like now all you here on YOUR Playlist is songs you don't know and can't sing along to...the only way to get rid of it is by adding at least 15 songs to your Playlist! So me being like ok I did so...for awhile everything was good but the Spotify kept playing songs that I didn't add! USELESS!!!,2
This app is good but pls make an update where i can delete recent played pls PLSS I BEG YOU,4
"Long time user. Lately it's been full of glitches. Can't control the app, it always says Spotify is trying to play, it randomly pauses whatever you're listening to every few minutes. It's almost unusable right now. Its a shame because it's been my go to for so long 😕",1
I love this app but when i try to listen to my fav song it puts something else that's why i am giving you 1 star make it ok please,1
Love Spotify I recemend it to all my friends absolutely love the blend play list,5
I just wish for better sound quality and a light mode option,4
I pay for Spotify premium now because I don't like ads but Amazon music was absolutely atrocious when it came to podcasts. I have had zero issues with Spotify at anytime for anything!,5
Easy to use enyable and entertainable,3
"It works only when you open it, it's getting hard to use.",1
"I don't know if it is just my headphones, my device, or the app but it only makes the background sound and the shouting audible, but the melody in the songs doesn't play at all. If this problem is fixed I will rate 5 stars.",1
"30 mins 1-2 ads (pc), 10 mins 3 ads (android/ios)",1
Every time i wanna play a song. It plays the wrong song that i dont like. Please fix this,1
My favourite app. The perfect one. Love you Spotify 💜,5
A huge collection of music,5
"Amazing for music. Glitchy and extremely unreliable for podcasts. Please fix it asap, Premium doesn't feel very premium anymore. Edit: One year later and the issue remains. 2 star becomes 1 star.",1
I've used spotify for years and have payed for premium for a few years now. Recently the app has started skipping and cutting the music like a broken record. The problem stops when my phone screen is either unlocked or at least on. I've tried all of the recommended fixes online. None of them have worked. If the problem persists I will be canceling my premium subscription.,1
"Does whatever it wants, it's easily the worst of the apps similar to it. It turns podcasts on or off at will and changes the podcast mid episode and loses its place which can be annoying to go back and track down where you left off. All this especially since 99% of the time I'm using the app while driving. Not a fan but I got a prompt to review the app so here it is.",2
"Very interesting! great format , real lovely",4
"This is probably just a personal experience, but I've reinstalled the app three times, restarted my phone, and cleared the cache twice but the app won't work. It will open and just show me the logo. I'm not even given the option to sign in.",2
Ever time I try to listen to a certain song it always play something different.,3
Very good selection of music,5
Wonderful songs apps,4
Spotify has introduced me to so much great music based on what I already listen to. Every music lover should have this app!,5
"After few minues of installing the app, and after I opened it, I was surprised by the ammount of restrictions that you add to the app, to a level that you maked it dead. It is like someone is in a prison or detention. I hate how you put the users in this situation to pay premium which is not accepted. Although, if you would like to make the app better, at least show how it is cool and useful for at least the first few days, then I might think if maybe I would like to purchase the premium.",1
Just awesome and easy,5
The fact that the sometimes you can't end group session and needing to reinstall it every time is cancer. Because of that sometimes the reinstalled app can't open. You can't even do a damn group session on the desktop like bro it's 2022 how badly advance do you want it to be.,1
i love it!!! very useful and worth it u should try,5
"Love the app, but somehow now it doesn't show me audio controls for podcasts. Meaning I can't pause, skip, go back, or whatever. :/",3
"I got Spotify premium but why can't I click the shuffle button multiple times, now it just starts nd pauses the song. Plz fix its annoying",2
"Best music app but it has flaws, im on android and if i plug in my headphones spotify automatically starts playing without me goig into the app. Another flaw is that its gonna play ads every 30 mins but its more like every 10 minutes. Great app overall tho",4
Spotify podcast suck so much a**. The absolute only reason I use it is to occasionally listen to Rogan... unfortunately it barely works. Spotify should gtfo of podcast because they can't even make a reliable podcast player... POS.,1
"My playlists are not on spotify mobile so I can't do anything on it. Linked account on laptop, etc work fine. Only mobile. 1 star.",1
Too many advertisements. Had to listen to 10 advertisements in a row before finally listening to some music,1
"Play bar disappears and you cannot skip or pause playing episode, only way it comes back is with a force close.",2
Love using this podcast,5
"You guys are making this app worst day by day. You need to understand what the users demand. Just don't think about your so called business. For example, today I was playing my liked song and it jumped into another playlist. And now I can't even change the song or playlist. What the heck is this?",2
Spotify premium is great app to play all your fav music!,5
Why you added that hiding feature? Because it sucks when I want to unhide any song!,1
Fantastic app bc it so cool an easy to use,5
Well worth it for an infinity of songs and especially because there aren't any lame whining Canadian neil young songs...🤣,5
Don't have any word for this app Brilliant app,5
"Love this app, however there is a bug where the player is not showing and its becoming really annoying.",3
My music keeps stopping for no reason. The web player for computers is way better than the app.,2
You have to buy premium for the app to work correctly,1
Downloaded episodes don't play without internet. What's the point,1
Best music player in the world love you spotify 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗,5
wowwwwwww one of the best audio play music platform i love it. awesome.,5
"Moved to Deezer after constant skipping of tracks or restarting then , plus random shut down ..just because you are the largest streaming company does not mean you can provide a substandard app to your paying customer's, I would advise not starting a payment subscription right now as these issues have been going on for months , my subscription is now cancelled and I've moved to Deezer which is a far superior streaming service .",1
"I can't give this 5 stars because they took one of my absolute favorites (planet net, by the subdigitals) off here completely😔. But i'll give 4 for everything else",4
"Great app for playing music, although when I search up a song I want to play, after all the adverts have played, I have to skip through multiple different songs and sometimes I don't have enough skips to get to the song I want so most of the time I go on yt and play it because I can't be bothered waiting for songs i don't know to finish playing!",4
"I would have rated it 5 but the lyrics in songs are in tht(ex.korean,telugu) language only i mean english too and I took subcription of a week and it just wont let me see the download option😓",3
Amazing app nd whatever song u search🔍... U r gonna find it.... It's so flexible to use nd really good audio🔊 quality 🥰,4
"These new updates suck Are you going to fix the offline mode, because when i dont have data i want to open my downloaded playlist, an all i get is a black screen, i shouldnt need more data to play something that is already downloaded. For now im going to cancel my suscription, i dont want to live with this again, ill try youtube music",1
"Has been bugging out recently. Won't show what I'm playing, will randomly stop, isn't keeping track of playlists",3
It's pretty cool I like it but too much ads and lyrics in songs are wrong but still I like it,3
When I try to watch a podcast using Spotify on my t.v it won't show me the image,1
"Echoing the feedback from other premium users - the app was working perfectly fine until a few months ago. Now podcasts and music pause without obvious reasons, and some of the buttons disappear randomly. It's really frustrating.",3
"Covid spam, crashing, hard to navigate. Takes forever to load list of episodes. No fast forward. Buy premium to skip song lol.",1
This is best app because all songs are available on it and also my favourite Kaira l love *Spotify* Thank you *Spotify*for this you are amazing,5
The hell is wrong with Spotify. It always play the wrong music,1
Why can't I use the app for a few days now? I tried uninstalling installing. Even rebooting my phone and yet nothing happens. I need to stream.,3
"The User Interface needs to be a little more usable when it comes to reporting songs with swear words in as some are missed. Also, they do not include certain swear words into the explicit category so I will often hear s*** in songs and no E next to them.",4
Best music app so far,5
"Hi, I changed my account to 2 accounts, the monthly fee went up but the changes didn't happen, when you don't do your job properly, how do you expect to receive the fee?",1
This is a AMAZING app and I feel that it has all of the songs I ever want to play and I am glad I downloaded it.,5
Brilliant music experience.,5
"I really don't understand how one of the biggest music apps on the planet can be this buggy. Frequently missing the ""now playing"" tab at the bottom of the app, which means all controls (skip, pause, etc) are missing. Randomly says ""no internet connection"" while clearly connected to the internet and streaming. If you search for a song and play it, then let it autoplay similar songs afterwards, you can't go back and listen to the original song without backing out and selecting the song again.",2
It's not opening. The app isn't opening,1
Best platform for streaming music tbh,5
"Was good at one point. A very long time ago. Now just fluffs its own playlists with fake artists. Spotify has discovered its more profitable to pay themselves than it is to pay actual people, and has stuffed its playlists with fluff to smother out actual artists. Couple this with the horrible death spiral that is Daily Mixes (read: same 25 songs you heard yesterday, plus all the songs you tapped ""block"" on- in case you changed your mind) and also F ""car thing"". I have a stereo but yall ruined it",1
There is some bug that does not allow the songs to be played in the order it shows in the playlist. Please fix this,3
I have premium but it still wont let me download songs for some reason,3
"Absolutly love it! My husband and i both have lists,that people follow. .trippylist is one of them.. If you like phish, dave matthews, widespread panic, follow trippylist. Abd tgeres other vands on it",5
"Nice app it's handy and most music is on it, you guys should add music soul mate.",5
Good but please add an option to rearrange songs in our playlist again. Don't wanna open my PC and Google Chrome again and again just to do it.,4
App will not load just flashing Spotify symbol and no customer support to fix it. I've had it since Google music stopped 2 years ago. I've loved Spotify since but for the past week the app won't load. I've uninstalled and installed 90 times but still won't load. Spotify needs custom service and support. You don't value our money or membership if you can't provide that much,1
"A little pricey, but am enjoying it....",5
Works fine most of the time,4
Nice app for music,5
It's the best music browser,5
"it is a great app but it has a skip limit time now and it does not have the shuffle button anymore it does it automatically and if I click on a song it takes me to a different song that is not the one I chose, I will like to listen to my playlist in pieces 😤",3
Number 1 aap in all music apps,5
"It's a good app, but I don't like how you have to get premium to unshuffle your playlists.",3
Love the app when it's working. I'm paying 10 bucks a month for something to crash every 15 min and I've been waiting for over a month for it to be fixed and it's not the app timer cause I checked. If it's not fixed soon I'll find and pay for another service cause dealing with this for 10 hours a day while I'm at work is ridiculous.,2
"Worst designed app I've ever used. Takes ages to load downloaded content, or to download content at all. Every page seems to take way too long to load. Get any other player.",1
Great and easy to find your music.,5
Best music app no issues or any bugs,5
"Great when it works, but crashes 30% of the time I try to use it, need to restart my phone just to get it to work again.",2
I love it soo 😍💕much it feel very relief when you 😌listen music But only problem is the adds,5
Fantastic and free!,5
"I've seen worse UI and UX work on other apps, but not many.",2
"The app start to crash very often, at this point it doesn't start anymore.",3
Great music application 👌,5
Best music app ever ❣❣❣,5
"Premium user for 7 years but the app just does not work anymore! The play button is missing, and the app just stops working every 30 seconds when on mobile data!! What am I even paying for at this point? Even when the songs are downloaded and I am ""offline""!! And you can't speak with a human about these issues, there is no telephone number!! Soooooo disappointed 😞. Im also looking into other music options now",1
I love Spotify! Not only for music but I listen to podcasts before I go to bed each night. It helps me drift off to sleep 😴,5
The app is great. The experience so far has been top notch. Keep it up Spotify!,5
The app is good only if you purchase premium.,5
It's won't shuffle the songs I have in my library or my liked songs. Since the update it won't shuffle the songs.,2
"I love Spotify, but I've been having trouble using it since an Android update from a few days ago (I have a Samsung A50). I can't access any kind of media, whether it be albums, playlists, podcasts. All the songs have disappeared, but I still can see that the playlists (and so on) exists. Please fix this bug!!",4
It's really nice as you can make your own playlists but it doesn't show songs by its self. You need to search them and then add them all one by one.,4
"*UPDATE* Still no response re my emails. So disappointed. Time to cancel services I think. The status band from the bottom of the screen is gone. I can't pause, skip forward or back etc and it makes navigating the app frustratingly difficult. I have emailed a help request twice now with no response. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I've logged out and back in. Still nothing. For an app I pay a premium price for I would think somebody would interested in resolving the issue.",1
Easy to navigate App with all your fav tunes,5
HiFi promised by the end of 2021 yet still not available. All competitors have HiRes music and most have spacial audio. Spotify is so far behind the competition at this point. Can't wait to cancel.,1
Never needed to look anywhere else for a specific song.,5
Hlo Sir I am Spotify user sir I request your premium plan on payment method in play store i requested you pls open the service in play store payment pls i humble request,1
"Spotify has become smoother since my last review, so I have to clear the app out of history a lot less. I'm not a big fan of the new plus button in the bottom right corner. I don't need to make a new playlist so often that a dedicated spot in the menu is necessary and I don't make podcasts at all. This button is functionally pointless for me and moved the other buttons that I used slightly to the left. Overall, still a great app. I'm just nitpicking the constant changes to the UI.",4
Constant problems with this app for 2 straight years. All that money and can't put out a good app that simply works...,1
Great music. Easy to navigate.,5
"I've had Spotify paid subscription for years and love the app, but ever since the last update it randomly stops showing the song that is playing as well as pause stop next etc and the only way to see it again is to reboot my device. Could you please look and fix this?",5
"First of all i have it for like 1year now and it super works but rights now It didn't let me in i tried to uninstall it but it still didn't, pls fix this",3
"Since you've updated this app, it no longer connects to the dedicated Spotify app on my Pioneer Head unit, only through the phones Bluetooth. This has been proven by people uninstalling and reinstalling an older version though an apk install. Please fix. Zero interest from Spotify brings this down to one star due to lack of any customer service.",1
There is no option to download single song. Download is available for full album Only. So add icon to download one by one song.,1
"I love it.... I will recommed this app for everyone to use♡ i loved the most is that it shows lyrics in every single song and it it has a really few adds, you all guys know how irritating the adds are😢but you will not face that problem in spotify👍👍👍I loved your application.",5
After using Spotify premium for 3 months it's nice but if you don't pay for it you will have a hell of a time doing anything on the app.,1
"Do not buy premium. You still get ads for podcasts. It is not the podcasts' ads, they are supplemental ads that go straight to spotify. On top of that, they have overoptimized this just like every other app. Convenient to switch from car play to non car play, only problem is the floating button is placed right over the play button for a song or album. These overlooked problems are everywhere. Buttons on top of buttons, settings not saving, network not updating. I cant justify $9.99/month anymore",1
"Spotify is a nice app and I like it very much but all of a sudden the songs in my playlist aren't visible and there are only names of the songs. I can't order the songs in the way that I want and I can't see what song is next. I deleted Spotify and installed it again but it didn't work, I also cleared chache but that still did nothing.",2
"I have to uninstall and reinstall this app every few days. Podcasts just randomly stop playing, even if I've downloaded them. Annoying.",1
It always tells me I am offline. I know I'm not because all my other apps work fine.,1
Good sound music any thing you want to listen to,5
Awful app and service. No longer paying for premium as spotify simply does not work!,1
Excellent. Enjoying Spotify on phone & in car very much!,5
"Terrible really. Slow to load menus, searches, library. Sometimes it wont even load my saved songs for minutes forcing me to restart the app. Even worse if it's in offline mode. Often just stops playing randomly and has to be reset to work again. Terrible app",1
Whenever I randomly open the app (randomly) it just keeps stopping and I don't know why tap on a podcast another song starts playing.... It's not that my phone lags or something else but no my phone is brand new and about about my connection then I really have a very strong connection.... I uninstalled and reinstalled it but still same problem. It was making me sick.... I really hope that the developers see this issue and fix it..,3
I've always liked Spotify and how it adjusts to my music tastes and changes. The sele tion of available artists and songs is also awesome.,5
"I love this app. It helps alot and you get anything you want du music, Motivations I mean every kind of song.",5
Since one and half hour i cant open app. it's not opening. why?,1
"Yaa...this is app is very nicee.. It's feature are like fantastic.😊 In it have all type of songs like remix , any trending song , edited song , any other song. In that app you can make lot of playlists without any lag. I like this app and you should be download this app. And after downloading this app don't forgetting to ""Rate"" this application. Okay.... ; /",5
"Love Spotify, couldn't imagine my life without it...:)",5
Had a login on my Spotify so I changed the password and logged out of all accounts and it let me log back in on my laptop but for some reason it's just stuck on the logo screen on my phone and a lot of other people have that problem if they log out. Not really sure what to do. I uninstalled it and restarted my phone and it didn't work either.,1
Best music streaming app hands down,5
This app is the best music app I have ever used.,5
This spotify music touches the very thougth in mind . A true experince to listen.,5
"Absolutely perfect except for the fact that (without Premium) I can only replay songs from my personal playlists on my tablet. However, I can replay my songs that are on my daily mixes ;) Recently, however, Spotify has been messing with my phone. I know it is spotify because when I uninstall it, the stuff stops. Spotify, please stop pausing and skipping my music, stop pausing my YouTube videos and not letting me play them. Stop playing your music at random times when the app isn't even open.",3
Great content! Drops out sometimes or turns off for unknown reason.. but great free app!,5
Bad. For some strange reason my app is not working. I switched to premium and now the app just starts and shuts. Don't know if this issue is connected with my mobile or otherwise. Looking forward to hear from the technical team of Spotify thanks..,1
Best music app on the market,5
App crashes constantly,1
"It is great, and although there are still things to improve you can see they hear the user and improve what they need.",5
I love music and i like the variety of music and songs arranged. I love to listen to all the podcasts,5
All good but ads are come in every 15 min,4
Usually my go-to app for music but it won't stay open on my pixel 6. I've had to reinstall twice in 2 days.,2
Great so far easy to use .like the new music that it suggests not everyone likes this feature. But love being able to listen to music,4
"I have purchased premium subscription to avoid ""ads"" but no use,waste of money,I am frustrated by ads....please don't waste ur money.....developers make improvement...other wise no use",1
I'm a premium user and can say this app is so buggy it's insane while listening to podcasts they constantly restart and i have to try and figure out where I left off because when it does restart it also marks the entire podcast as played so you have no clue where you left off on top of that since the new update i can't access what is actually playing on the app at all it doesn't even say I'm listening to anything and I'm unable to pause unless i close the app fix it I'm sick of paying for broken,1
All of my favorite podcasts from all aspects of my recreational life to my professional life in one place.,5
"Navigating Podcasts is such a hassle. You scroll down a podcast, find a podcast and add it to your playlist. Then it goes right to the top. So you have to scroll down again.",3
The amount of Ads after listening to 15 minutes of music is getting frustrating. I'm a free user but I feel like I'm bombarded with ads.,3
Very nice app for music lover,5
great collection of music,5
"Love it! ❤ i can find all of my music, podcasts, meditations in one place.",5
The whole package is great. I would recommend this app to everyone,5
"why did the shuffle option change when you listen one of your playlists ? it just sucks, the same songs play on repeat and you juste have to skip them MULTIPLE TIMES when you could just skip them once before, and just go on with your 45h of songs. Also the linked songs in the radio are the same that are already in my playlists, yeah I like them but what I wanted was discover new ones... and if you want to remove them from radio because you already know them it just delete them from your playlist",2
"couldve been a good app if it werent so restricting. its decent in windows, but in mobile? god, this app is the worst. too much lag, needs premium for everything, and plays random songs you dont put in your playlist. you cant loop a song in mobile either.",2
Great streaming app I use it everyday...🤙🤙🤙👍👍💯💯,5
I didn't like/ I don't like the automatic update! & now (without premium) how to one song on repeat?! This new update/new version 8.7.44.968 is Sucks!😡,2
Terrible app. Can't even play the song you want. When I click a song it plays something entirely different. You can't do anything about it unless you have premium or you use a computer,1
"Hi, I updated my app to the lastest version but I still have problems on lyric sharing. Can't seem to find the button on it even after restarting my phone or clearing the data of the app itself. It would be great if you could help me on this one. Thank you!",4
"☹️☹️☹️ Spotify is an amaazing app.. knowing tht.. i went for d premium.. but even aftr the payment, it is still not showing premium n still i get ads .. if anybody cud help.. pls do☹️",5
Really good music easy to use,5
"7/7/22 - The app had been working fine for a while, but is now suffering from the Samsung/Android issue. The playing now bar doesn't show up and the app stops playing randomly in the middle of songs and podcasts. 1/13/21 ‐ I've been using Spotify for about a year now (with a paid account) but recently the app has stopped playing anything. Will definitely cancel my service and uninstall if it continues.",2
Music = Freshness This is the Great Music listening App.. And guys seriously experience is great...,5
"Have been using this streaming platform for years, and I just now decided to rate it. It's everything and more! It's interactive and can be very personal. 5/5 for sure!",5
Great app for listening to all your favorite songs plus finding new ones but there is always room for improvements.,4
"Used to work great until the last update. Now their is no option to pause or resume music or podcast. The only way to pause is to completely close the app. This really sucks Spotify, as a premium customer I should have an option to pause not close the entire app. Please fix this!!!!",1
It's annoying when it crashes suddenly. Not that frequent but often enough to be annoying.,3
The best music service in the universe!!! 97 custom playlists and counting. Downloaded music is amazing. You customer service is the best. Nobody can match Spotify.,5
"This software is really terrible. I can't get rid of the ""currently playing"" item and I can't get the sort to play podcasts starting at season 1 episode 1. How in the world can sucg basic software be so bad.",1
I don't know what happened but I can't see the songs that I added in my play lists but in my liked songs I can see them. I'm hoping it could be fixed or it's just my problem? But this app is awesome 5 stars:)),5
can't open the app suddenly. I tried uninstalling it but it's the same after reinstalling again.. I'm stuck at the logo.,1
"Every every song I look for is there....,. Still haven't found a song that isn't on there",5
Too much ads,5
"Someone already mentioned it but I'd like to say it as well, the dots thing at the right side of the searched song seems to be removed, it was very easy to add songs in playlist that way but now u have to play them before adding, not very important but just wish it wasn't removed•́ ‿ ,•̀",4
There's a glitch. I have to Uninstall and install the app. Sometimes when I press play. The player doesn't show,3
I love using it but damn I can't freely pick songs that i want to listen without shuffeling So it makes me frustrated. 😐,3
After last update i can't forward podcasts via Bluetooth or on mobile app,2
Here at Spotify u can make a world u want where u can feel ur self without any hassle,5
Haven't been using long enough for 5 stars. Am happy so far. Still figuring stuff out.,4
Best music app ever!!!,5
In the new update i am not able to add songs to the queue.,4
"I can longer have my Spotify play on my phone if I have it open on my computer, I have to close the app on my computer or else it will just kick me off the app on my phone",3
Spotify does what I always wanted You tube to figure out.,5
Spotify continues to play my music or podcast but won't show the media bar to pause play or skip my songs,3
I love Spotify.,5
Best music app suggest this app to save battery life and stream or listen to downloadable music. Not a free music platform. But the music suggestions and logarithm world class!,5
"Poor, music stops randomly , bar dissapears, what's going on??? Think it's time to look at rivals",1
"Since last update the queue system is broken only lets you add one song to a queue and will frequently bug out and hide controls for currently playing podcasts and makes it impossible to pause it from the app. I dont know how you managed to ruin your qrues system more the YouTube music buy this is embarrassing, if this isn't fixed by next billing date I'll be forced to move platforms so that I can actually listen to my music and podcasts",1
"All the music I need, easy to access and organize an extensive library.",5
"For more than a week now i an unable tobdownload Spotify app on my Samsung A51. I have been in touch with the technical department and have done all the measures one can perform to fix the issue like deleting data n cache, clearing up storage and memory uninstall and reinstall thousands of time. Spotify could not rectify the issue at all and then wanted me to participate in their service suvey.....rubbing salt over wounds...Its not free, i am paying for their service...feel cheated by spotify",1
You podcast experience sucks please fix it and don't put adds on an app that I pay for,1
"I can't even load the app anymore. I have a gig of free storage, so that's not it. I have had this problem for the past 3 weeks on or off wi-fi.",1
"Can not back to the previous song and when try to back the latest song is play, bad experience.",1
Dear Spotify Developer your awesome guys 💓💯... you are Algorithms make my days beautiful. Every day 5 to 7 hours i am enjoy music & podcast . I kindly request one things pls add podcast down people opinions or comments Aption add to podcast setion.,5
"Whenever I try to play or choose a song, the ones who show up are different I'd like to get that fixed.",1
It's a very good app for music. .,5
The app doesn't work.When i open app i see just spotify logo and it doesn't go,3
"overall, it's okay. it's just that, i hope spotify allow us to change our username :)) i do have/want to have spotify mutuals & it's a hassle without having our own username ,, hope next updates u'll have it already ^^",4
"Unless you plan on getting a subscription, don't bother. I had to listen to 2 minutes worth of ads after every 3 songs.",2
Trash podcast player. Crashed constantly mid podcast and have to close app and restart to try and finish listening. Garbage plain and simple.,1
Good probably but like without paying we can't download songs and if we are traveling especially music lovers it wouldn't come offline,5
Nice app! It will be great if it have a korean romanization to all korean songs so I can sing along with it 😊,4
"Been using it for years, it's always been buggy and has gotten much worse lately. Quits playing in the middle of songs. Quits playing in the middle of podcasts. Doesn't realize it's currently playing a song or podcast. The podcast library and list are so inferior, no reasonable sorting algorithms or ability to manually put your podcasts in order. Yes, I'm even a paid subscriber with a family plan 🤦‍♂️",3
Good experience for music,4
superb!! i like this app. you can set data usage and all song are there* but when you starting enjoing music *ad* comes so spotify have to give less ads on music.. i want to give 4.5 star but i cant lol'' :D,4
Great quality sound. Many problems with app.,2
Great no issues at all,4
"When I play my fave song, then the other song will play",2
Best music app by far,5
Better than Pandora not as much data used.,5
Really good experience 👌 no cap,5
"Buggy to the point that I'm considering switching services. Restarting the app is now a ritual of being a user. Wasn't always like this, only the past few months. Whatever the case, dev team has shown little signs of a fix coming any time soon...",1
"Everything's great except when i m going to buy premium it keep on saying ""cant connect to my internet"" when my internet is doing just fine with other applications. It hapens so many time at this point. And the update doesn't change anything, it still says the same thing....",3
"Love the music and podcast suggestions. I never listen to the radio anymore, only Spotify!",4
"The songs will not show in created playlists, only the artists. Also won't work with searching. Was fine on my tablet but just installed it on my new phone for convenience and was very disappointed.",2
this app is just awesome.if you are a music lover like me then just go for it,5
"Great mobile music streaming app, but premium subscription is a must to avoid annoying ads. Hoping that community and listening history features will be expanded in future to be closer to the desktop app.",4
My new favorite music platform!,5
It's a lot different from Pandora I can actually make my own playlist send them to friends I can listening to podcasts and everything. Overall good app but you really need to fix Those ads I got 11 in a row before I was allowed to listen to my music and then after listening to two songs I got 16 in a row so you really need to fix that ad problem.,4
I can't open the app this is trash,1
"I don't see the control screen for podcasts anymore. It keeps playing in the background and there's absolutely no way to even pause or stop it other than force closing the app. This wasn't the case until today (July 07, 2022).",1
"Stopped working. Uninstalled, installed new still won't load. Either stuck on logo or black screen",1
This app only let's me skip a few times and I can't add the song I want anymore so 1 star,1
"It is the best app that I have on my phone!! I can listen to my fav music and also make my own playlist so my friends can listen. Though, it has some problems. I dont like how I choose a song and it plays another song that is totally different from the song I chose. I also dont like it when I cant repeat the song I just listened. There is also a bug ive been experiencing lately. It always shows the spotify logo on the screen when I use my phone. Its a great app though:)",3
"While listening to my playlists the app will randomly divert to a number of songs ""based"" on what I was listening to.. if I wanted to listen to random songs I would chose to do so this has recently cause my previous rating to drop from a 5 stars to 3 stars If the development team could answer this in a timely manner it may be appreciated 👍",3
"So it's a wonderful app, but it glitches often. I have to uninstall, then reinstall every couple of weeks.",3
I freaking love Spotify it is the best ever all the songs I ever wanted are all right here on Spotify thank you so much Spotify you guys rock,5
"I can't see the control to skip, pause, stop music, etc. Please fix this!",1
This is an extraordinary app.......i would love to get premium but.... only limited platforms for payments are available.....nowadays even non popular sites give a lot of platforms......it would be more convenient if you have Google pay...... please take in note of my request ( only for that reason I've given 3 stars ....or would be giving 5💖😀),3
Can't play music only plays 2 song then stops 😑,1
"Thing i really hate that when i try to listen to a song there's always like 10 random songs, and i can't even Skip all of them, like please just let me listen to the song 🤦🏻‍♀️",3
"Was a great app until a week ago, for some reason it stopped working. All of my liked songs disappeared and won't play any music. I tried updating it, uninstalling it and re-downloading it but nothing works. I'll have to go back to pandora if it doesn't get fixed. Plz help",1
Can listen to songs in the background while using other apps,5
This is a best song app,5
Taking away the one star because of the advertisements,5
I don't like it a lot when I want to play a song anotjer song pops up,1
Great selection and easy to use.,5
All good To Easy Spotify Rock's,5
"Spotify does provide quality music. I use s22 and there are no lags so far. But there isn't any spatial audio support even on premium membership. Apple provides that but I guees this problem is limited to Indian customers only. Other than that, best playlists, best recommendations, Music releases as soon as possible. Great, just waiting for the spatial audio support.",4
l love spotify because it has every song in it!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Exellent on music but there the ads,4
I'm rating this 2 stars whenever I keep skipping the song that is NOT in my playlist its still keeps letting me listen to another song that isn't in my playlist its quite annoying.. It's just I can't buy the premium but I want to listen to my own playlist so please fix it.,2
"My Spotify does not work if I use wifi it shows ads but doesn't let me choose the song to play as there is no ""internet connection"" I am not able to listen to my podcasts and am very dissatisfied with the app. I deleted the app and reinstalled it and now I can't even login. What a great app!",1
Musical lovers always like this app such an amazing 🤗❤️,5
"I am so angry at Spotify! On mobile, whenever I'm trying to listen to a song, it plays something else and it makes the one song I wanted to listen to a playlist with a bunch of other songs! I am so pissed and I am uninstalling the app now 🤬",1
Please fix I pay for premium but it keeps pausing and stopping.. option to play next song is not even there!!!!,1
An app that can't play a song we like for free at the time we want is useless,1
"Frequently force close and current play button is missing, both in app and in my phone notification (also lock screen?.",1
"It won't even start anymore, It will go to the standard black screen with logo, go black for a moment and then go back to that screen untill my phone tells me the app isn't responding. I have reinstalled the app, checked for updates, restarted my phone, it works fine on pc and others, other people have had this issue before, so fix your app please",1
"Please add annual subscription, the monthly subscription is really annoying, if you don't add annual subscription, I'll shift to Spotify mod version",4
I don't know when the last update was but I have a lot of issues with whatever is being played just suddenly stopping. The player itself looks different or won't even show what's playing. Something is weird.,3
"After the latest update it keeps glitching, sometimes it doesnt work at all, and stopped working on my android auto,tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still does the same",3
"It worked fine for the first few weeks and stopped playing under WiFi connection, it's stupid",1
"I used to love this app. It was the only place I got my podcasts and music but recently it either stops whenever it wants to or it won't stop without me uninstalling it. It also starts to play a playlist then plays a random song not on any of my playlists?!?! I have a premium account and am seriously thinking about cancelling it, it annoys me so much! Sort the problems Spotify!!! It can't just be me?!?!",2
Worst aapi search the songs but another song is playing,1
"A great music App..,😍😍😍",5
"I rate you 4 because I ended up having 2 accounts,tngiba n Tngiba I wonder whether you going to charge twice",4
I cannot even listen to the music in my playlist,1
I literally listen to music all day I don't watch television and I'm hooked on Spotify right now,4
"Has been a great app, but recently it's been glitchy AF. Even very simple tasks like pausing what I'm listening to, has been too much for it 😑",2
Its really good would want to listen to it more,5
It randomly will play the podcast without the bar used to pause or skip so I am forced to close the app. It constantly pushes my phone's connection to my PC even though I haven't connected the device (device not even avalible when I am on PC) but yet the podcast I was last litening to gets loaded and I loose what ever music I was listening to on my PC. Don't even get me started on all the issue with Google maps app integration which makes for unsafe driving! Please contact me for more info!,2
The problem is that I'm trying to listen to my music but on phone there is no way to stop the randomized song option which chooses from your Playlist which doesn't sad to bad until you notice that they also added songs so play instead of your music and I've spent an hour deleting music off my Play list that I didn't even add and after I finished they added more songs so basically what I'm saying is is that I can't even listen to the songs I like when using this app,2
"These are issues that has gotten worse over the last few months. App continuously runs in background even when closed, and will randomly start playing. Or, app will refuse to close. App will ""forget"" what I have been listening to when I pause and switch to another app.",1
"I was logged back into Spotify, but someone rubbish named Mick D was not taken off my home section because I had previously selected it by mistake. Please can you remove it? ❌❌❌❌❌ Stormzy ⭐❌❌❌❌ Party Rock Anthem ⭐⭐❌❌❌ AC/DC",2
"Glitchy app, could be a lot more user friendly. But good library of songs if you can deal with finesse'ing your way around it from time to time",2
It is fun it gives us the perfect songs,4
"Good sounds, good music! Enjoy!",5
"Hi 👋. I love Spotify, I received Spotify premium for free for 2 weeks. Thank you Spotify. I found it great and I will still keep using Spotify as is until I get a good feel for the app.",4
It holds the best music even from old times,5
This is an amazing app 💞🦋 wld love if liked songs can be played without using internet 🥺🐾🍁,5
This app is great and all but the fact that one can't stop shuffle if on a free account is annoying..Also why does it play recommended songs without asking...,1
Lots of ads at every 2nd song avg,1
"When I save my music to sd card, the whole app becomes unresponsive. Please tune the app so that, it only keeps the downloaded music to the sd card and cache files in the phone memory",3
"Had to reinstall the app as it won't let me download songs, I'm on premium. Now the new installation won't even open. Nothing but issues ever since it updated. Please fix.",1
I just love this. Much better than Apple Music,5
"Spotify, you're the best music......",5
Very poor for a paid service. -The music frequently stops for a few seconds -Play/pause and skip button disappears -The shuffle function favours like 20 songs I will be contacting spotify for atleast a partial refund.,1
"It got even worse somehow. Now the app closes or crashes every 5 minutes, like clockwork, so I can't listen to ANYTHING",1
It won't even open it's just kept loading and loading,1
Best music app.,5
It's a good app .it's assessable and easy to use do it's really amazing(◍•ᴗ•◍)❤ ..I love you Spotify your playlists are fantastic .I recommend you Spotify.,5
I like the apps for Android phone and it gives me what I want,5
Love to have someone options of songs that is ol,5
Best music app ever.,4
good quality of songs,5
Easy to use and has all the songs I want.,5
"Use Spotify every day for hours, has everything I want and more",5
Great APP! Many Playlists. I have found almost everything I have been searching for!,5
Playbar disappears on regular basis. Should be fixed.,3
Worst app ever I just purchased premium membership and now I can't use wifi to do anything in the app always showing no internet connection. My other apps are doing fine with wifi I've been using apple music for about 2 years and I've never face this issue I am so disappointed. Please check yourself before pay for premium.,1
"Its great! My issue is it isn't available in all countrues, N i wish if we could download and listen offline",3
"The music available is awesome,I have no need or desire to listen to the Podcast selection. If I could find another alternative to this(Spotify), without the annoying Podcast,I'd do it in a heartbeat.",5
It is the best music app I ever had.,5
Y'all can find almost every song/mashup/remixes here!!,5
Why cant i get a premium? It has been 6 months since i got a premium but why cant i get now? Is this a bug or malfunction?,1
"Very limited on Commercials, straight to the good music..",4
I enjoy listening to my christian favorite songs,5
excellent application more than the others.,5
Your better off listening to music on YouTube because then at least you may actually be able to pick what song you want to play on a playlist instead of it forceing it to being random every time and sometimes it'll play stuff that's not even on your playlist and the only way to skip it is to have premium or use one of your six skips for the day. The only reason I'm keeping it is to keep track of which songs I actually like so that way I can listen to them on YouTube. would not use again,1
Amazing music app,5
Best Music Streaming App,5
"Pc version which I used on a tablet was absolutely amazing but the mobile version is dogshit, can't even pick a specific song to play and I can only skip 6 times? Retared system which makes me want to drink bleach.",1
Spotify is the best app that I used the songs are amazing,5
The ads are ridiculous!!! I'm a free listener and every two songs there is 5 commercials and it's dumb so I am going to stop using this app!!!!!!!!!,1
It's easy to use and also user friendly,5
"Should section off playlist we created from added playlists. It constantly disconnect me from facebook and my friends isn't visible or updated. Even when my friends are visible, what they are playing isn't updated. The songs that isn't English, example japanese or chinese have reduced significantly.. Even english ones are no exception.",3
I love it. All I can say is. It has all I needed to hear. ❤️❤️❤️,5
"Would rate better if I could choose the songs I'd actually want to listen to, the Xbox/Tablet/Web client are all far better than this junk.",2
"I don't know if this is a glitch, but I can't even choose the song I want to play when I want to listen to my playlist. It just plays some random song. I tried to play lofi music to relax and it played We Don't Talk About Bruno. Its kinda annoying that I have a small chance it'll ACTUALLY play the song I want. I'm still gonna keep trying though. I also keep getting ads for period pads which is kinda gross 🤨",2
My spotify took too long to open. I tried clearing the data and cache but it still doesn't work and operate. Pls help fix this.,2
Stopps playing for no apparent reason. No more dropdown comands. Its still buggy which is kind off incredible for such a big company. Shame,1
"If you want to discover new music than this app is for you. Because it will add to your Playlists, it does not give a choice in the matter. I understand what they were meaning when they did this but it can get annoying. If they fixed this I would like it more.",4
It's awesome having all the songs you can think of in 1 spot and the lyrics playing along is the best feature. Love it,5
I ain't gonna buy premium try putting as much as advertisements u want!,1
It's a pretty good app to listen music on.,4
I recently purchased Spotify premium and after my subscription was over I canceled it cause I didn't need it anymore but after that it logged me out of my account and won't let me log back in or reset my password,2
This is good app and easy to use,3
Luv this app but I found songs on youtub but aint on Spotify little confused bout that but over all luv it💜💙💜,4
It is a wonderful app. It has all. Kind of songs and can be operated on both PC and mobiles.,5
"This app is easily the best music streaming app when you pay for premium. No ads, offline downloads, great recommendations, unbelievably high audio quality, and a very user friendly UI. Without premium, you have relentless ads, lesser audio quality, no offline downloads, you're not allowed to ever turn off shuffle play. I get most of these, but when you lock playing albums in order behind a paywall, I think you're getting a little money hungry. Just pay premium and you'll get your money's worth",5
Fun fun fun!,5
I just really like for the music,5
It's bad in the sense because it provide all benefits just in the paid version. I mean to say some benefits also provide to the free version.,2
At first the app is good but now I can't play the full songs and the format has change which is very confusing. Plus it only plays the preview lol,1
Constantly cuts out podcasts and only shows playing song about half the time good for music but alot of bugs,1
The Best music steaming service,5
"This ""intuitive"" app is worthless. The only good thing is its library, and its barely that. Update: still worthless. 7/7/2022",1
Spotify is the best music app ever. It give only one ads of 30 seconds and you can listen uninterrupted song for 30 min.❤️ And this app has quite smooth experience 🙂 must download it.,5
Its not opening after many try of re installing,1
"When o open it, it just stuck on the logo.",3
"You should be glad i rated this 2 stars. Why? Because i made a playlist and random songs keep playing, i literally have like 10+ songs in my playlist and i didn't hear any of them, Please..Fix it. also When I listen to songs they just randomly stop, Kindly fix yhe bugs^^ thanks",2
did really like this app but for 4 or 5 days the app gets permanently stuck after repeatedly playing the same add (Clash Podcast) Has made a great app unusable - will revise stars if/when issue fixed,4
"Not reliable enough to pay for. If you're willing to put up with crashes and times where it just won't open, fine. Just don't pay for it expecting the paid subscription to change anything; it doesn't.",2
Inappropriate and irrelevant advertising that isn't kid friendly.,3
What a Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful song about my JESUS who gives us Excess Love that we dont deserve. Thanks Mercy Blessings on you and yours 🙏💜.,5
I got really good music I got a really good library of some really good sounds really good artist I'm good with it,5
Worst app .. With 10 minutes music and lots of ads,1
The app won't let you access the music and podcasts you've already downloaded to your phone when there is no service. What's the point of downloading them to your phone if you can't listen to them offline?,1
Great for offline music and has a wide variety,5
Hard to rate compared to other offering but I like Spotify and it's a good deal.,5
I use spotify every single day. Also get Premium,5
"I love Spotify and all the music it brings me, but recently I've experienced trouble using the lock screen widget (it no longer exists), so I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, now the app won't even open!",1
"Yeah, apparently, you can got ""hacked"" here. People can add songs to your ""liked song"" without confirmation.",1
Easy to use and enjoyable. The music available is fantastic,5
"Love the app, but the player bar on the bottom frequently disappears, leaving podcasts continually running without a way to control them unless I force stop & re-open the app. Will rate 5 stars when fixed.",1
Keeps putting a push in my notification area even though I blocked notifications. Uninstalled. Play Music is much better anyway.,1
"App takes forever to load...like over 1 min. Program is very slow to start playing, but works after. Don't know if it is because it is downloading songs or if it is a memory hog. I have my songs on an SD card.",2
Exploring n awesome experience,5
Just awesome app for music lovers,4
"I overall enjoy Spotify because I can download with premium. Sadly I can't play it on my phone right now because my phone updated and Spotify just has empty playlists and nothing works. It says I'm not connected to the internet and I am. I have done everything imaginable including deleting it, logging out, Etc and nothing is worked to fix it. I don't know if this is the phone update issue or Spotify hasn't caught up to the updates yet.",3
"Spotify has been extremely buggy on my Samsung S22+. The biggest problem is when I open Spotify, whatever was last playing or is currently playing is not displayed in the player. It's just missing. Closing and reopening Spotify used to fix that. Lately it will persist through attempts to fix it. Has a lot of problems accessing ""offline"" content I specifically downloaded to listen to when offline. Displaying wrong dates shows were last updated 😕 Fix this buggy app!",1
"My Spotify is not opening... When i open it, it only shows the Spotify icon Please rectify this problem",1
Excellent all around. Thanks!,5
This is just disgusting...I mean I can't listen any of my favourite songs without premium accounts!why?this is not done..If you want to listen songs for free then this is not a good app for that...toooo disappointing,1
They would add their songs to MY PLAYLIST! I can't make a playlist without having songs I didn't put on it on.,1
"Everything I'm looking for, an app worth listening to.",5
Well I love this app the platform is so accessible and easy but mainly if you have Spotify premium like if you don't have it you usually have to play an ad or a couple to play 1 song or it plays a song in the same genre. But with premium you can download songs for when your offline and no ads! It's amazing if you have premium,4
It was a great app except now it cuts in and out sometimes for some reason. Sometimes it won't even play. Please fix this,5
If used properly. A great app to share with YOUR family and friends,3
I've had Spotify for about 2 to 3 weeks and it's seems great and is better than I thought it was going to be.,5
The app stopped working and will not open past the logo screen. Have tried everything for days and still can't even login.,1
Best app all songs available easily,4
Everything is great but ads are annoying sometimes i get 3 to 4 ads continuously,4
"I have a Samsung a10e and one day my Spotify app stop working it keeps saying that something went wrong try again I tryed everything even signed out and back in the app but nothing, I tryed to clear my data and everything and nothing i love using the app but I can't use it because of this it keeps saying stop working and something went wrong try again even when I try to go on my playlist or try to listen to music it keeps saying it idk if it's a bug but I hope it gets fixed soon.",3
This app has been acting up lately pausing for long periods during podcasts and won't play via Bluetooth in my car. Also will play the same ad over and over and I'm unable to skip through it and get back to whatever I was listening to. I've had to Uninstall and re install numerous times the past few weeks. Please fix!,1
Song i would rate this a 4 becuse when i try to play a song it puts a diffrent song on and my settings are default but these song are good so 5,5
"The app logged me out of my account, I've had to update my password and now the app stays on a screen with the logo and won't open at all. I have uninstalled and downloaded again and updated and it won't open.",2
"It's not bad.. Wish they'd move the ""hide this song"" from in between ""liked"" and ""add to playlist"".. Because it just makes sense! Often hit it by accident.",4
"Charged me for 3 months after I canceled my subscription, and would only refund 1 month. No customer service to phone, shotty online support. Not impressed",1
Way too many ads,1
"Every thing is perfect but please show the lyrics in language in which the song is and not any other language,",4
I can't open the app anymore since I updated it.,2
"I used to love this app. I pay for the premium version. With the latest update I can no longer pause, rewind or fast forward.",1
I love spotify except that they keep adding songs to MY playlists,4
Spotify is the best hands down music app that is on the web I'll never use another app for my music,5
Not Working its showing only black screen,1
Keeps pausing on playback.,2
There are some songs that aren't available on spotify that I feel should be there but overall Spotify is one of the best out there.,4
We couldn't even download any music for free,1
"Linkable to many services and devices. Selections somewhat diverse. Convenient w/ offline DL's (paid)《BUT》Poor shuffle randomizer. Wasteful efforts on useless features, IE: Strange Things mode. I mean really? A feature only experienced on a single page? I mean, who watches the screen whILE LISTENING? even MTV learned that years ago. But the penultimate reason I can't give above 3 is they don't pay artist's a fair share of THE profits. SO Much so that many musicians boycott Spotify.",4
Way better than Apple music or Amazon music,5
It wouldn't go past the loading screen even after trying to restart my device and uninstalling and reinstalling the app.,1
The play and pause button are not coming on.,1
Not displaying current song being played. Can't use on multiple devices at the same time.,3
"You guys are driving me cryz, i found great Vybz from your app. I also recommend you add offline playlists in case of network barriers and bundle depletions",5
So now this app disappeared from my phone and won't install,2
"I love it, all my music, when I want it.",5
The ads are too long..,1
Sometimes the playlist dornot opens and then again I have to download it or maybe update again after the given update.,4
Premium is worth it. Its trash commercials over and over again if you don't pay for Premium.,3
"This app has been terrible the last few months. It stops randomly, you can't stop things playing without force closing the app, and the play bar disappears regularly. When is any of this getting fixed? This is a paid app, not a free one. There's no point any more. I'm taking my business elsewhere.",1
Play/Pause bar missing. Songs will stop playing by themselves. Have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times in 3 days. Fixes the problem for a few hours then the glitches start again,1
Awesome music and video,5
Have been paid but can't work,1
"The only reason i have spotify is for the joe rogan experience and its almost not worth it the app co stantly crashes, changes what im listening to the way it works is trash i have to uninstall and re install this stupid app at least twice a month i ho estly cant believe people pay for this trash",1
Could the app be any more glitchy. Also if you could crash a little more than 2 to 3 times a day. That would be great. Thanks,1
Nice app for song downloading....,5
Bundle of collection and quality 😍🥰😇❣️💚,5
I don't like this app cuz I play bad liar it open a wrong sound😢,1
"This music service itself is great, but the app is so poorly implemented. Every other update, something breaks and I have to downgrade it. (potential security risk).",2
Best free music streaming app ever!,3
I have always loved the Spotify app. And I have always been impressed with the improvements made over the years. But here lately when I go to turn my volume up or down when I'm on the app. My phone bogs down and almost freezes. When it does this it won't let me do anything untill the volume slider is gone. It acts like I get 5fps when I hit my volume,4
The music is great and it has great sound quality but i had 11 ads in a row. I usually don't mind two or three ads but 11 ?? seriously? this is unacceptable. Please do something abt it thank you.,1
"It great and all, a good amount of adds but 6 skips per hour? THATS STUPID, I CANT LISTEN TO MY FAV SONGS AND ONE OF THEM DONT SING THE EXACT SONG. And STOP adding songs to my playlist!!! Your ruining it!!!!",1
This app helps to release my stress by listening to wonderful song selection,5
You can't listen to a song with out going on a Playlist and you can't start over the song,1
Stop putting songs in my playlist,1
"Accessible, best app",5
It's a great app. Whatever music I want whenever I want it.,5
I love it so much in paying for it lol,5
"Just THE BEST, I started by myself first, but now I converted my whole family!! Love Spotify",5
It's okay but just I don't listen to much songs. It's amazing.,4
I've been using spotify since I was 12 and it's been alright. The one thing I'd change is making people pay to get rid of ads.,4
"Having an issue where the app hides the ability to skip, pause and so on.",3
Easy to use but sound quality is so so,4
100% has everything!,5
The app is great. But I don't like how the playlist has to be shuffled. What if I want to listen to a particular song? I can only skip 6 times an hour. I really dislike that.,2
Multiple ads every 10 minutes.,1
when you pick a song it doesn't play it but the next playlist please fix,5
Sometimes my spotify plays random music not in ny playlist,3
"Edit: This changed on mine (THANKFULLY) so I'm changing my initial rating of 2 stars to 4 stars! The removal of ""pressing play in liked songs and having the songs reshuffle themselves"" in place of ""pressing play in liked songs plays the last song listened to in liked songs"" is very frustrating. I liked being able to click the button again and again to have a random order of the songs I like. I don't always know what song I'm in the mood for. I have premium and this is dissapointing.",4
Constantly crashes. Won't resume the podcast I was listening to. Instead starts a random episode. Almost impossible to use.,1
Garbage. Crashes all the time. Downloaded music doesn't play without signal. I'm going back to SoundCloud,1
Spotify is great. Great variety and easy to use. They provide a great amount of variety for music. Also the podcasts are vast.ots of options and things to learn.,5
Deleted my account and still charged me for subscription that is so unfair and now I can't even unsubscribe,1
"So now we can't fast forward or rewind anything we are listening to? What happened to the little bar to do that with? Also even after the new update it still does not allow you to select the next track from the lock screen like a pop-up window. U have to fully unlock the phone to change the track, please fix issue it is very annoying having to unlock the phone to change the music.",1
Why are commercials being played in the middle of songs? Trash music app,1
"I pay for Premium and the app always shuts down on it's own in the middle of a song or podcast and then when you open the app back up, it doesn't have the option to pause or play so to stop whatever is playing you have to close out of the app. I contacted customer service, they told me the only way to ""fix"" it is to uninstall the app and redownload it. This happens multiple times a week, nearly every day. What am I actually paying for?!",2
Good music app. Missing some songs I love. Charged me wrong once.,4
Intermittent audio on all devices using Samsung phones (2 different models) and different BT devices. I uninstalled Spotify and then reinstalled. So far so good. Spotify remembered my library so l am happy l didn't have to recreate. Spotify: Why don't you have a user note about this issue. Enough people are having the same problem.,2
Great app for music.,5
I just can't understand how it works He doesn't give the song when I ask for it He puts a lot of songs in front of me and I can't get over it 💀,1
Get better at bugs but your alright for the meantime,5
so far this is the best music app I have used rarely crash's Plays offline has a multitude of features and functions and very easy to manuver around. Thanks so much guy's and gal's for all your hard work,5
Good quality music,4
If you are into music or podcasts then they got you. Got more than you could want. More than the others. And better pricing than the others. Top shelf all day.,5
Best subscription 🙌 👏 you get what you pay for,5
Best app ever to here music,5
"Its a nice app for listening to music but half the time it will play ""suggested songs"" if i wanted to listen to those songs i would listen to them but i want to listen to the playlist not those songs",3
I can never get it to play my playlist if I try and click on it it will play music close to it and I didn't want that I've been trying so hard on the mobile app and it just sucks please fix it it's super annoying and I am never downloading this app ever again I do not recommend,1
Stop telling me I might like podcasts. They. All. Suck.,1
5 stars WHEN it works. So glitchy following the latest updates- widget doesn't work; randomly stops playing; no control bar; can't stop or pause play without exiting app entirely; sometimes available for car sometimes not.,2
"Love it, though I wish the ads weren't so long, I'm too lazy to buy something to remove them, and they aren't that bad.",5
Please add more items on profile & setting.,5
"Whenever I open my Spotify it just freezes the moment where the logo shows up and becomes unresponsive at all. I tried unistalling it many times, cleared my caches, freed up some space on my phone and it still doesn't respond and just freezes the moment the logo shows up when you open the app. I logged out on my Spotify and it just happened all of a sudden, I'm disappointed.",1
"Worked perfectly until I started paying This app worked perfectly for years until I decided to try the free trail. Now my control bar has disappeared, my played podcasts are coming up as unplayed, I've lost podcasts I was subscribed to. I won't be renewing my subscription if the premium doesn't even work",1
App sucks and non functional. Monthly payments for this BS! If I'm paying money for something it should always be functional and bug free,1
Really enjoyed the free trial. Got my son to uograde his account to a premium family account,5
I've used Spotify off and on for quite some time and I like it but if I had to say one thing negative I would say turn the volume down on your ads and that's it!,4
Please add the ability to play your whole playlist and not have to shuffle to different songs and add the ability to play your whole playlist on Alexa devices through the Alex skill please thank you so much.,2
Love the different station and ease of use to find the artists and songs I like 👍,5
"Love it!! Has any and all my old Rock favorites, Like Frank Marino, and Pat Travers, as well 90's Grunge.",5
It would be nice if it wasn't literally north korea on there,3
"Good app, doesn't let me unhide songs for some reason",3
App won't open on my new phone.,1
Pausing- app is broken and keeps stopping. The pause/play/skip bar is missing. I've uninstall and reinstalled and still no difference. Time to cancel premium,1
New update has problems with pausing and continuing play,1
It's good app where you can lissent music but somethimes I don't understand it:),5
"Easy to use, nice that premium and paying in general is optional",5
I love Spotify! I've had it for years and couldn't be any more pleased! Look out Pandora!,5
"When trying to listen to downloaded music offline the app endlessly buffers when you select your library, very frustrating.",1
I like it don't like the 3 minute ads tho,5
"Very nicee but Someone hacked my account and every time it plays we're no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I. You know commitments what I'm thinkin of, you wouldnt get this from any other guy!♡ I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling",5
my spotify is not working,2
I can't even use the app. It loads up just the symbol then sits there and goes no where idk what the problem is and none of the trouble shooting tactics are working. I've payed for premium so shouldn't I get to use the F-ing app. I would do 0 outta 5 if I could.,1
App won't reflect my playlists. Has been updated. Won't let me update my screen name either. No available support for these issues either. Remind me why I pay for premium again?!,2
UPDATED: the recent Android version is very buggy. Random pausing and display errors with the player not showing so you can't interact with the song requiring a hard close/open. Seems to be a common new complaint,1
"#JRE is truly the only reason I use Spotify. Pretty good, you can find and listen to almost anything. Ads stink, especially the ads from Spotify trying to get me to pay for premium so I don't have to listen to ads.",4
It's a good music app but I wish the student discounts applied to high schoolers not just college.,4
"Despite force stops, restarts and reinstalls, persistent problems of a disappearing play bar and playback randomly stopping. I recently got a Samsung phone and apparently this is a known problem. Please fix or I'll take my money elsewhere!",1
Completely bugged after update,1
"Wrong direction, this last update was the worst in several years. Broke all sorts of things in the Android app experience!",1
Not good l can't listen offline why can you make it possible,2
"The app keeps asking me to connect my devices(assume this is for data harvesting), why do I need to connect my device if it is already paired over BT? Debating on cancelling my membership and uninstalling if thos prompt persists.",1
Everything is good but this app shows tooooo much ads... It's just Irritating...,4
"Wish I could rate this junk lower. Garbage app, pauses, fails to load sometimes, full of ads, freezes, limited revenue for artists, trashy interface etc.",1
Mobile app is rather good but on wearOS the app is very limited. I can't even search for anything.,3
Stopped working after the most recent update won't even open 4 out of 5 times the one to two times it does open I get a blank screen the next time it opens I can't get into my library. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it twice I still can't get it to play every time I open it. As of July 1st 2022,1
Stop showing these BTS ads in background,1
Absolutely love this app. I have a very interesting fan light that has a Bluetooth and have paired my phone and able to pick out any song with guest and sing and dance with this ceiling fan that changes colors and has a speaker. Using Spotify puts so many genres at your fingertips to keep the party rocking!!!,5
"I paid last month for Premium Family & my wife. Unfortunately she past away two weeks ago. Love the music, but I'll keep her phone too for when family come 5o visit.",5
I haven't had any problems with this app. I have been using it for a long time. I would just like to suggest that there should be an option to select a few songs at once to add to a playlist. Sometimes it is a bit frustrating to choose songs individually.,5
If there is a way to sort downloaded songs by artist that would catch you guys up with 15 year old music players. Also can you manage to show album art properly for a whole week straight? And the now playing bar doesn't always show up now and whatever is causing that also keeps me from controller music with my car or earbuds. Just don't be trash for 3 months straight. Dare ya,1
Handy in the car or in the shower for whatever music I'm feeling or cool podcast I want to discover. Can't imagine having to make do without it.,5
"Been away for a bit, app got worse! I seriously don't get how this can happen. Every time I open the app I get stuck in the ad loops! Like seriously how many ads do I have to listen to. I have to close the app and reopen it. Talk about making it so u subscribe. I'll definitely be finding another app. Horrible!",1
Songs stop playing randomly and over the last two days the player bar disappeared so I can't pause / skip / etc. I have to force close the app to make playback stop. Works again after I restarted phone.,5
"Cyber beggers, begging for premium subscription in between every songs.",1
I now can't pause music or podcasts. I don't know if there has been recent update but this has been happening since yesterday. I uninstalled the app yesterday then reinstalled this morning. Iwas working fine until now. Won't use app again. This is a pain in the neck.,2
"Was fine until like 6-9 months ago. Music player keeps disappearing, so I can't pause or skip through tracks correctly. This sometimes causes the music to stop randomly as well. Really frustrating. Using Samsung s10e",2
It would be really nice if Spotify could bring out the feature of using UPI for the subscriptions for premium like Netflix. This would really help people like me who wanna take out a subscription but don't have a visa card. Please do consider in the near future!,5
"Good music app! Sure, the Spotify premium only features are annoying, but it gives me music. It's functional, unlike Pandora. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
It reduces my storage to be fully songs that I can make a playlist n play it online 💯,3
I love Spotify I use it all the time it bring so much joy into my life,5
"With each Update it gets worst, Sometimes the search bar doesn't appear, Sometimes search does not load, Sometimes the music plays but there is no bar indication...",1
"it was phenomenal, always suggested the songs I prefer, perfect quality, although without Spotify premium, it's pretty annoying getting ads and not being able to play the songs I want too",5
Great variety of music!,5
"Really good to use, I've been using Spotify a lot in the last 2½ years, Haven't had any issues with it (besides losing signal every now and then when in the car - as a passenger)",5
"Keeps pausing on it's own every couple of seconds for no god damn reason. If I could just scroll from the top of my screen and press the play button I wouldn't mind, but I have to enter the app again to press play just for it to pause again.",1
Awesome app but too many adds 😒,4
"Works fine on mobile, if I'm on WiFi no matter which one it just won't load anything, I tried everything, the app has all permissions, still nothing!",2
Overall it is good but the only problem is that the ads. They just take to long for it to play the next song you want to play like 3-4 ads will happen in between of you listening to what you want to listen.,2
"won't let me play songs I want, and also shuffles songs when I want a specific song ALSO ALSO IT ""ADDS MUSIC I MIGHT LIKE"" I HATE IT, WHY CANT I HAVE JUST A FEW SONGS THAT I WANT",1
"The service itself is great but the mobile app is infintely annoying. Most frequently I just listen to my ""Liked Songs"" playlist. I choose a song to listen to in the car then close the app when I get out. Anyone with a brain would think I'd want to continue listening from where I left off, right? So why is it that when I reopen the app, even if it's only been closed for a minute, my playlist has jumped ahead by about 100 songs? This is incredibly irritating. I would give 5 stars if not for this.",4
Amazing app for those who love music 🎶.... But sometimes there will be some glitches... But not all the time 😉... If u r reading reviews to download this app then just go and download this application ☺️👍.,5
Best place to listen to music too!!,5
Good content for podcast.,5
"3 stars until I see an update to fix this issue. I love this app, I've been a paid subscriber for years, but for the love of God if I have ""unedited"" songs in my liked songs, Do Not! Switch them out for edited versions!...I'm 30 years old and if I wanted to hear the edited version of ""gin and juice"" I probably wouldn't be listening to r & b in the first place, please fix this has happened to me so many times!",3
Excellent 👌... Good for burning calories....,5
I can't turn off shuffle I don't have the icon,1
I've had Spotify for about 5 years now and I'm a premium user I love the sound quality and the music they put on here the only problem which is why I'm give 4 stars is that it keeps glitching when I'm skipping songs it will either not play or keep going to the song previous or just skip 3 songs over other then that great app,4
App is amazing but after the recent update I'm unable to login to my profile. App won't open it gets stuck at the launch doesn't show any fields for email address and password. Hope they fix the bug ASAP,1
This app is worth its keep. Have enjoyed it so far. Hope they can improve on the sound output.,5
"It's fun and free, but because of the auto shuffle I can't listen to a single song, even recommended songs I have to wait and listen to 5 other songs just to listen to a song I might not even like.",2
Very useful and enjoyable app.,4
"I was once a deezer user but when i tried this app, I have been so addicted to music",5
"Spotify is great, I love it",5
"Worked fantastic on mobile until recent update. It will take a short time to load (usually seamless), but then the controls do not appear after selecting a song. Don't know if that has to do with an ad that always plays? Can't see which one, no controls or album/ad view. After a few songs it will cut off. This time it crashed after 2 songs. Addendum: same issue with podcasts, even if an advert doesn't play first--no controls, cuts off unexpectedly. Happens on WiFi or cell data",2
"Hey, can you give us an option to just randomly play a song, either from any of the playlists or from your suggestions for me or any random song and not just the last played song, from the home page upon app load? More like the Surprise me option in Netflix?",5
Very Good Music App,5
Brilliant especially on Bluetooth,5
"the app is pretty ok but the newish design changes are annoying and intrusive. I just want all MY playlists in one place which doesn't need me to add filters or whatever. adding and removing songs is a chore and in general there seems to be a tendency to adding unnecessary and ugly buttons everywhere. Also, why is the basic menu laggy? do we need WiFi constantly to just pull up the tab to add or remove from playlist. The recommendations and compilation albums etc are very good though.",3
Best music experience ever,5
It adds songs that I don't want hear!,1
"I can't use my spotify, I don't know what happened.",1
Any options left for students who cannot afford premium and have to deal with double unskippable ads?,1
Perfect music app!,5
"Usually love Spotify, but recently been having problems with it! After about 15 minutes of playing something it just cuts off, radio silence. When opening app, it takes a long time to respond, doesn't show you what you were listening to so end up having to find episode/song and play from beginning. The other day the whole app just wouldn't open at all?? Something has happened in the recent updates that has made it really buggy and laggy.",2
Good music so many ads,4
Great App. Really like it. Strongly recommended.,5
Has all my favorite music!!,5
This is best app of songs I love this really,5
Suppper app. when I upset.and tired Just i listen the song's in this app.my mind is fulllll happy.and I realised my tensions. Thank u. Spotify.,5
"The only issue I have is the gapless feature, it works on my phone really nice but when I transfer to my google speakers or in my car it doesn't work at all.",4
Some songs are unplayable😒 Please introduce the light theme also🙂,3
"I used to love it because I could play my favorite tracks anytime. The ads were annoying yet bearable. However, recently, I haven't been able to even open the app. Whenever I try to open Spotify, it just kicks me out. Currently I'm using an alternative. I might leave a better review next time if this is fixed.",1
When i share it in snapchat the thumbnail appears twice and the link appears only once with the image i can't delete that so please fix this problem asap,4
Totally unusable since last update. Tried troubleshooting for days now....still getting nothing. Very frustrating Spotify and Samsung Galaxy A20!!,1
Lot of ads,3
Very good app for people of all age group and excellent for senior citizen,5
Nice app for listening sounds,3
Amazing collection from old to new,5
I like it. Its easy to use.,5
To many adds and if that couls add the downlode feture for free that would be cool,2
Just a very great app......love it and proudly recommend it too......there are ads but it's ok....np..this app has helped to overcome my sadness and also entertained me in every moment of life...,5
WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE THING WHERE YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE MUSIC A BIT BEFORE PUTTING ON YOUR PLAYLIST,1
"Completely different from the web version, good sound quality yet any playlist song Is completely random and you have 6 daily skips, can't get around it by playing single songs too. Overall the app is O.K. but the pc/computer web version is way better than the app.",2
"App crashes constantly, the media bar disappears when playing music or podcasts and then I can't pause things, and the sound will randomly turn itself down while listing to music (not related to another notification appearing on the phone). This app is trash",1
It's a super cool app you will get all songs you want Tho it has add but still working amazingly well when you have low range,5
"Recently had started stopping randomly when screen is locked. Also the play bar at the bottom disappears a lot of the time so the only way for me to stop a song is to shut down the entire app and start again. Lots of glitches, not great.",2
I totaly recommend you best music app ever its really worth it 😊😊😊😊😊,5
Love this app it makes me feel better when se thing happened.,5
I don't have any issues with this app at all really amazing,5
Good if you have premium without it it's kinda trash,5
"The App runs like a**. Every time I reopen it when I want to resume a podcast or song, der player disappears and the pages load for a minute or more. Every other app on my phone works fine.",1
Spotify is nice app except I can't get into my playlist and it loads to slow .,3
I would say it was great 1yr ago but now it is the equivalent to apple music,1
! It would be nice if one could sort the songs in one's own playlist manuel or after genres. -Sometimes I have the feeling that the app is a little bit buggy or weird because sometimes it doesn't let me put songs in repeat. +But all in one it's a nice app.,4
This is very good AAP . I like this AAP very much . There all type of songs . Thanku so much for this AAP .,5
You need to fix this I can't choose my own music and I have family premium... Fix this please,5
Good sound quality ❤️❤️,5
App works great!!!!,5
Great app and Spotify is the best,5
"Best App as it , Provides a wide range of Songs , BGMs and Also supported Background Music , But it will Be better if we can Clip from these songs And listen those clips",5
Playlists are the same song you already have...... In a playlist.,3
Podcast video disappears randomly and doesn't show up even after force stopping the app. Terrible UI and I'm using android,1
This is amazing. I really like it💜💜 #spotify💜💜,5
Spotify needs some help after using for a few weeks it previewed only I mean the song stops after 10 secs I tried really hard 😅 but it was broken,1
"I keep wanting to use this app for podcast and everytime I get discouraged. This time, I'm listening to podcast fine but I cannot pause it at all. The control to see what I'm playing is not there. Only way to stop it is to force stop it. I'll try again at some point but it's pretty unusable for me. Also, the controls don't translate to my car when I connect over Bluetooth. I'll update when these aren't issues.",1
"I love Spotify, especially how it suggests other songs when I'm editing a playlist.",5
"why won't it let me in? it's been like this for two days, fix it.",1
"Would not open no matter what I tried, spent about 2 hours trying to fix it. :( It was pretty good when it did work.",3
"It sure has improved a lot compared to the earlier days, however I would love to see a better pricing policy for me to opt in and avoid the adds.",4
"Compared to the desktop app, this app is terrible. Bugs everywhere, too many extra ""features"" being added while the core functionality gets worse. For example regularly the play/stop buttons just simply disappear. Only way to stop the audio is forcing closing the app. This doesn't happen on other audio apps. ""Offline mode"" doesn't work, you could download something and get on a plane and the file won't play.",2
You can find amazing songs!You can find ur favourite artist,5
"Please fix the dozens of bugs. Shocking experience. Now playing bar doesn't appear, podcasts won't play despite being fine on desktop. Had to uninstall and redownload, lost all my downloaded songs and files. I live in a bad signal area so rely on downloads when not on WiFi. For a market leader it's absolutely ridiculous.",1
"Pretty good, like the recommendations but now my playlists are buried under other stuff unless I click for only my composed playlists. I do love some of the suggestions made by Spotify.",4
"I searched for a song appeared, when playing it not the song I've searched 👎👎👎",1
Very good app for listening ads its been 6 months i am listen to ads but there is some issue sometimes it play songs that ruined my mood of listening ads,4
It has all the good music i like,5
I love Spotify!!,5
Everything is good I really like this app But there's one thing Why isn't canvas available in Nepal ?? Please make sure canvas is available in Nepal too.,4
I really love this app I literally use it everyday and have a subscription however. For some reason it stops playing all the time it will be playing fine for 20 mins then all the sudden it stops playing and when I try to press play it won't so I have to close the app completely and go back just to turn it back on.,3
Wonderful app! You can play music offline even without premium. The only problem is that there are too many ads.,4
Great songs from this app.,5
I know a lot of apps do this now. But Spotify happens to be the one that did it recently. it's really really annoying to have my phone go off every single day when Spotify failed to get payment.,4
Had no probs for so many years in my Android phone but now idk why but my Spotify doesn't lauch its always hanged on a black screen.,3
"I have been experiencing a sudden stop to what am I listening. Several times in the same podcast for example. Also, lately there is an error and I can't see anymore the buttons. I was listening to a playlist, had the music stopped not by me, and had to go back to the same music manually. Or I didn't had the skip the music even visible on my screen.",1
"I love it! Would give it 5 stars, but I have to undownload it once and a while because the app wont show the song I am listening too.",3
"Excellent app. Love the music variety to listen to. Not having app issues.👍👍👍 *(edit) this last update is bad, I need to hear 3 ads before I GET a chance to hear a random song, yeah you heard it right (a random song) because it doesn't let me listen the one I want, if I am lucky I can listen to that song after 6 skips. It shuffles the songs. Total stars goes down to 2 🌟.*",2
"Good appp for music listeners. However, please stop adding other kinds of music in my playlist. It's not a good option...",3
Awesome great for downloading tracks and albums would totally recommend for all ages. Just think it uses too much space. Recently it has been occasionally crashing or stopping music. But other then that its a great app.,4
App is not opening.. I have installed it several times still the issue isn't fixed..,1
Got some bugs going on. Had to Uninstall cuz the app went into possessed mode.... I was watching a movie when out of no where music started interrupting...,2
I love Spotify!,5
"Can't play an individual song, cant choose a specific playlist, wont play songs in order and cant listen offline or in between apps.",1
"App frequently clears my queue with no warning, repeats the same song 10+ times, breaks my playlists",1
Love Spotify soo much I love music so that makes sense but I can't afford to have premium so if u want to play whatever song u want without worrying about your skips have Spotify on a tablet or I pad and u can just pick what song u want out of your play list if that makes sense,5
"Songs clarity superb, good app to hear all journals of music.",5
"Urgent Requirement! ⚠️ You must add the ""download music option"" in tha application. Although downloads remain close inside the application. But it should me in free mode.",3
"It is cool and good songs are there,no ads and no advisement,are there app is excellent.",5
Very nice music experience thanku for Spotify,5
"I cant even listen to my own songs, last time you can but now you can't, this app sucks",1
Absolutely horrible every update it's even harder to get the song you want to play I installed it just so I don't have to install songs and I don't want to pay just to listen to the song that I want to :(,1
The app is super awesome... i got no complains... I'm so so happy... Some songs don't have lyrics i think they have to sort that out but so far so good👍🏾,4
Spotify is really great. I love the sound quality and the way it creates playlists for you is crazy. I only listen to Spotify songs and it's so AMAZING!!!,5
"Free version is garbage! I do not mind an ad every few songs. The free version adds songs to your playlists. Can not skip them. You can not play individual songs, shuffle play only. You can only skip 6 songs per hour. Uninstalled",1
Great app for music,5
I hate this app because of the extra songs part when I listen to my songs songs I don't know pop up and it's irritating,2
More and more if u buy premium and if it's end u more ads,2
The quality is good but the only problem is adds .... It contains a lot of adds plzz remove the adds,3
"Playing meditation music at night - cuts off after 30 seconds. During the day, can drive 8hrs and not have it cut off. Adjusted all the settings so that it has full background access, no luck. Super disappointed.",1
App having nice song collection But the app shows partiality in treating languages. When hearing Hindi songs lyrics comes in Hindi script However while hearing Tamil songs lyrics comes in English script. If Tamil songs lyrics also comes in Tamil script. It will be 😊.,3
Amazing app always calms my mood after a long streeful day 😊,5
This app gets really annoying when I try open it it never actually opens properly and it takes me an hour just to open it don't recommend,1
"Used to be a great app. But now if you're a Samsung Galaxy user there is no more visible player. Which means you can't pause, start, stop, skip or go back a track. It also now crashes regularly. I've been a premium user without these issues for years, but now it is hardly worth the subscription. It would be useful if Spotify could rectify these issues enabling the user to have some sort of listener control. Update: it had been fixed but now the same issue is happening again in July 2022.",2
"It's a very nice app, specifically for music but there's only one catch that the ads are so annoying",3
Why don't you just play ads instead of songs?,1
"Worst app, if you want to listen ads thn listen sportify, but if you are interested in songs thn plz find another app",1
Good music app i like it,5
Some time only lag.............,1
Why my spotify error when i want to log out. I have try to uninstall and install it again but this app can't fix. Please help me to fix the app😭😭😭,1
I'm unable to open app. If I go onto the internet I'm able to view my Playlist however I can't click on the app itself to take me there anymore which is frustrating.,1
I enjoy Spotify and have been using it for quite a while. My only gripe with it is that when listing to an artists mix I wish they played more of the artist and less of the similar artists.,4
"I dont know whether i am using this app for listening music or listening to adds!! After ever 60 seconds of addd, if i change the 2-3 song quickly, it gives the yt shorts add again withing fur seconds.. it seems like i would have to uninstall this app. Cause its really annoying.",2
The new update is not the best it doesn't let u listen to the music u like,1
I mostly enjoy the app. I have over 4000 songs downloaded. Recently the option to shuffle play has disappeared and it plays the same songs over and over. I knew that I can make playlists but again it's the same thing over and over.,4
The pc spotify version is greater than this version. It doesn't need premium to skip/unshuffle the songs,1
"I've been using it for years, but I started having issues with my downloaded songs during these past weeks. The songs get stuck at 4seconds in and won't load. Even if they are downloaded. I'm now trying to uninstall and reinstall it ..",4
I rate this 1 star bc when I play my favorite song it keeps playing on different song which making me hate this app. Plss fix this,1
"Hi!i have been using Spotify for a while but now I just can't play any playlist or song ,it keeps saying something is wrong ,my internet and everything is very well working ,and this problem annoys me alot so pls fix this ,leaving this evrthing else is fine.",4
"When I try to play a song it always shows"" this playlist is empty. Go to Home to find playlists just for you. how to resolve this issue?",2
"i cant open this app no matter what, its stuck literally and the worst thing is 8 have paid for premium, i have paid and cant use it just because this stupid app just dont responds. i have tried restart, reinstall and everything btw this sucks!",1
It's Spotify. There's nothing bad about it,5
Its a very very good up I can't complain with it but the problem is the ad's I know you can buy premium but it's kinda annoying every 30 minutes to have a 30sec ad maybe do it every hour or something like that,5
"This app is perfect but i giving 3 stars because the many songs i search was not found by spotify. The soundcloud was the best it have every song when i search. Please add the turkish,arabic and remix lofi it is miss in spotify. Please fix it and add. Thanks",3
"3 ads per skip is bollocks when the chance of hearing the song you requested is already a 1/5 gamble unless they like what you request. Sepultura, slayer",3
Still learning to navigate the programming. Guess I have to go to Premium because the commercials are annoying,4
"App crashes every all the time. And ad plays, it crashes. You switch to another app and comeback to spotify, app crashes. Always have to restart the app.",1
"I cant skip songs now, i got only 6 skips per hour. Like what the hell bro? I just want to listen to music normally, not to wait until song end. Im not using this anymore sorry guys",1
After every single song it plays add n they r heavily annoying even after update they haven't realized its annoying to keep such thing they removed the feature 30min ad free after a video add better to see other option,1
"It doesn't play the music I like, it doesn't leave my main screen. I just hate it",1
It skips when I don't want it to and it messes with the sound and it keeps playing and pausing when I don't want it to..if this is a bug please fix it.,1
"I like how I can play any songs I want, although it can only be 6 skips.",5
I love bts songs sooo much thank for providing this all😇😇,5
"Would give higher, but lately the app will not even load.",2
half the songs are missing! not what i like to see in a paid service. Amazon music has better collection of music!,4
some other songs are not available like BTS song and other Things is ok Please sort out this thing why BTS Songs is not available,3
It works great but sometimes has some issues of quality audio.,4
Excellent app....👍 Easy to use..lots of options... enjoying the music so much...,5
Great to listen to music,5
Best music app i have ever used,5
This app is getting worse It's meant to be free and you get 30 minutes without no adverts And I am still getting 6 adverts I can only listen to music for 15 minutes it for 15 minutes then I get more adverts,3
"I love spotify, I listen to the podcast and I listen to a ton of music, I have over 2,000 songs saved and I have a premium account and have had one for a while, would recommend Spotify to anyone and I do.",5
The app has been great however recently when l search a song it plays a totally different song from the one l choose.,3
Good music listing app,5
"I used to LOVE the app but now all my downloaded songs are u downloaded and I had to download them again BUT I can't I tried several times but it just won't download again so I tried downloading other songs abd again no luck! I have premium so I can't say sth about skipping and stuff but I think that since the last hupdate Spotify is just 💩. It's lagging 24/7, and I can't even listen to music offline cuz it just won't play. Please fix those issues Spotify!!",1
This aap is so cool i find any song on this 👍,5
"The apps doing really good on my end, although when I exit and play a song when I get back on the song doesn't show on the bottom. I wish we could pin more than 4 playlists on my library. Other than that I still love Spotify<3",5
Mine is not connecting with the internet and i just subscribe to premium my App is crashing,1
Best App ever created in this world 5 star without any doubt.....if u have a doubt then go duck yourself... thanks...,5
Idk what you guys did with the interface but it feels like i have less control.,4
"Very rare to not find a song I'm looking for.....it happens, but not often. Even obscure music is available, I love that the lyrics are offered with most songs.... I'll never not have Spotify",5
"This app has major link and playback issues. I use it on android OS12. Firstly, you cannot play a direct song that is shared to you via social media. When you press the green play button to the bottom right of the song title the app simply ignores it and plays whatever it wants from random artists. If you enter your savedplaylist the same thing happens. This is very biased copyright playback since the specific artists on spotify cannot get there own music played per share. Fix it.",1
I Really Love Spotify But app it's not working please fix it,1
"Whenever I start a radio based off a song or artist (which is with the intention to find a NEW artist or NEW music that is related to the song/artist I'm starting the radio off of) it just creates essentially a playlist of music I've been listening to - and not even within the same genre off the song. I've realized that I haven't found any new artists or any new music, and just continuously listen to the same things over and over again which is quite depressing.",1
"Along with the wrapped for a year, Spotify should also give the count for the number of ads given per year . Other than the too many ads , it is good for listening to music",2
Exilent sound full HD .. No ads problem.. I love Spotify... Friends download this app without any doubt .. it's my opinion sarojsk,5
Plays songs you don't want to play. (yes premium exists but listening to a song you didn't even click on is crazy),2
"This is the best music platform, I admit to that especially when the user subscribes to it. But certain problems I'm not so happy with is that it doesn't refresh and show recently released hits. I'll have to see them in other apps them download them on Spotify or follow the artist. I'll still give it a complete rating, 'cause the updates lately are good. It'd be satisfactory if I hear an artist dropped a track and I see it quickly on the home page. Please work on this. It'd be acknowledged",5
"No Auto Artist and Album List. It is should be all about the songs. If I like the song, the artist and album should be generated into an auto list.",3
I was happy with the app because it holds all the artists I like with very few gaps. Until I bought Bluetooth phones and discovered that it constantly stutters audio playback - the only app to do so. There's a very long discussion thread on the Spotify community going back to April 2017 with a multitude of other users who never found a solution. Some resorted to the competition because the company clearly doesn't care. I'm also considering that.,1
"It's a nice music app but then when I play a song from a playlist, it plays a suggested song, which I find annoying. I just want to listen to the songs I added in the playlist, not the suggested songs.",3
"Upd: watch your language Spotify and don't command me like that: ""Update your payment methods NOW!"". I won't update anything if I don't want to. I'm tired that I can't add to blacklist ONE specific track from recommendations/radios. I block it every day and Spotify continues to add it in my auto generated playlists. It's hard to reorder playlist in Android app.",2
I am giving you 2 stars . Songs are definitely cool with good quality but your advertisement are too much long I use YouTube because we can skip in 5 sec but your ads are too long 😑,2
New phone and the player has to be force quit all the time does not work properly.,1
"I've been using this app since it come about and have always had premium and in recent years it's just getting worse an worse, what is the need to redownload the same song every day Spotify?! I hardly pick new songs to go into my playlists and every single day the app is downloading said playlist for offline use. then taking extra long to search or even add to que, I never complain about apps but this is by far becoming one of the most unreliable apps for music.",1
"I can't listen to what I want, why shuffling songs in an album or playlist against my will ? Damn! Pls fix this..",1
"Amazing user interface, I'm able to listen to my favorite music and podcasts. Awesome app",4
It's good till it gets glitches.,3
Very good app for streming music,5
"Easiest and most convenient way for a student to stream music, but the app can be considerably buggy on my Samsung S8 *edit* Bugs still persist on Samsung S21.",3
"I love Spotify,and use it every day, have a subscription, BUT it's glitchy as heck. It restarts in the middle of stuff, I constantly have to check in on why it's stopped. So last night I deleted & reloaded it. Now it won't work at all.",2
They remove all the good song. Stupidify!,1
Download Spotify mod apks instead of real apk...we are here to listen music not ads,1
"I love listening song🎧 This app is soooooooooo perfect I am from West Bengal I listen hindi , English, Bengali, arabaic all songs",5
I dont know what's happening because my Spotify won't log in and not opening as well when I'm using my data. I got an error always!,2
The now playing bar has disappeared,3
the app is very easy to use and it sounds great! my problem with it is that it keeps playing suggested songs in my all my playlists even though it has over 50 artists and songs in it.,4
"Amazing app for songs, It's one of the best I've used of all for music...... there are just too many ads but everything is exceptional and premium was also good.",5
Nice sound quality,5
Awesome app with not just music but valuable podcasts.,5
"I've used spotify for years, it works without issue, and there's loads of brilliant user submitted playlists to choose from. There is ads every so often but you can go ad free, if you prefer. Unlike youtube you can close the screen with your music or podcast playing in the background, which is why its my music app of choice.",5
":) would be cool if everyone gets the premium package so everyone can use the account instead of just for 1 person, and with the discount price of a student. Music is life.",5
It is the best music app I have ever seen..,5
Love Spotify music.,5
"This app is good... I don't know why there is no older songs like 80-90s songs and famous songs like boys, visvasam,sivaji movies and so on .so pls add some Tamil songs from 2000-2021 and also recent movies songs",4
"Hi Spotify devs, I like using Spotify but as of late the app has been unresponsive. I logged out of my Spotify account and since then the app would open but I wouldn't be able to login or access the homepage or anything. The app stays stuck on a screen just showing the Spotify logo. Can someone help me fix this please",1
"this app was really good but the new update ruin the app, I just can play the song that I want for a second. please fix it, thanks.",3
"Far too many ads, basic things that should be free such as playing a singular song you want to listen to. You have to pay for",3
"I accidentally delete the spotify data, yeah that's my fault. But I try to reinstall it and now I just stuck in the logo loading screen",1
I like the app but the shuffle option is disturbing pls remove it,4
Very addective and super play list,5
Its an easier way to listen to music! It's honestly better than listening to music on YouTube. I love this!,5
It's awesome it just sucks that u have to pay for it,5
I love this app but the new update is annoying. I know that's on purpose to make us buy premium. Giving us ads is enough. Not allowing us to choose or change the music and making shuffle disabled for us is annoying. I'll still give it a 4/5 cause I've been using this app for years already but I just haven't bought the premium.,4
Googd app Advertisments tloud.... Much too loud Speaker volume to 50% but advertisments are 80%-90% or louder Too bad,3
"I've been using for 5 years , it's awesome , it's an app that I use daily, I've been using premium for a long time and I have absolutely no regrets , money well spent .",5
It's really ok and impacting but not all needed are available on Spotify.,4
Spotify is also a good application when there is internet and not good when it is offline,5
The pause play bar has gone missing! Please can this be looked at. Perhaps something weird in the last update?,5
Had this since 2014. I just HATE that the shuffle songs repeat. It's shuffled but in the same pattern every time,4
I would have given them a 5 only if they made us able to back up or transfer the downloads,4
"I really liked this application and I advise everyone to download it, but the only problem is when I want to listen to songs without the Internet, I can not, but the application is still very good 😍♥️♥️",5
"Cuberstalers, cgberbullies, narcissistic hackers BFF. The whole guns don't kill people people kill people Vail to hide behind. It's a good thing your not spinach then you can be recalled.",1
"Terrible just wants money.... been paying for premium for a year almost and now that I haven't payed they won't even let me in the app to select what Playlist I'm listening to, just give me 2 options 1) pay em or 2) cancel which I don't wanna do as my dad is in charge of our duo account. TERRIBLE STREAMING SERVICE!!!!",1
I love this app so much I have no problems with it,5
Basic features such as playing things in order are unavailable without paying,1
Wonderful! Keeps me upbeat when I need it,5
After getting the premium my life became to ease up a bit and I thank spotify 🙏🏾,5
It is very good app but it's new update is very very bad I am deleting this app 😈😈😈😈,1
"Used to be amazing, have been a premium subscriber for 3 + years. The latest update causes Spotify not to show the song playing so I can't skip etc. Will stop at random intervals so have to manually open phone again. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, problem still persists.",3
I wish I had premium but otherwise great experience,4
So it's great but I sort of miss Pand÷/ra. Spotify is awesome; however it's not life I've ever been to Vietnam. I got phished! Be careful.,4
Very irritating. I want to stream music over mobile data and says no internet connection seriously....... Furthermore i am a premium user but still suffer. Please check on that as soon as you can.,1
"Spotify is literally the worst platform you could use to listen to podcasts. They insert ads that aren't associated with the podcast makers and it makes podcasts sound disjointed. Premium doesn't even help in that regard. Some podcast episodes are also missing random 20 second snippets of audio, which aren't missing on other platforms so this is on Spotify's end. Most likely some kind of bug related to the aforementioned ads inserted into episodes by Spotify themselves.",1
"The app sound is amazing,i using some time",5
Spotify are tha best any music you have all thanks,5
"Best app to listen to your favourite music anytime ,anywhere.",5
Why don't you guys add a minus one feature for every song. Like a karaoke. Since you already have lyrics on some songs.,3
Auto play random songs. It is non sense frustrating. I have set auto play off and it still skip and plays random stuff. Utter garbage. Good quality in song is not answer to the random song recommendation.,1
Now this aap is vary vary bad I don't like it because any song if I play this is no play🖤🤮💩👎😤😡😠🤬,1
"July 6th, 2022. Just came back to Spotify today around 03:37, I'm not amused on how the Audio Devices I'm using currently onto Bluetooth and AUX Cable too, I used to have a quite different experience than a lower mono-audio about now. By the way; the sound was needed to be up around 94% oye. Ad's are fine but gives you 30 minutes of listing to music; But other devices that I use this app isn't the same, I only use shuffle mode.",2
Too much advertisement .. too much disturbing ...,1
Awesome reference to my favorite tunes,5
Full with Entertainment,5
Its good and choice in your hands.....,5
App shuffles my Playlist and took all my skips and plays songs that aren't even on my Playlist,2
"Waste app not opening in my tap only Spotify symbol is visible and every time coming ads on TV download Spotify,for party all are fake 😈😈😈😢😤",1
You should try to suggest some new and hits songs. And also make some other list for hit songs,3
Super audio quality,5
Spotify is wow I love it and I will recommend people to use it,5
"Best ever music app i ever experienced is spotify. Never witnessed any song unavailable and that's the best thing about it. But still , in offline music(without premium) ,it include lot of ads which can be considered as "" excess"".",4
I love this app so much I love the music and everything about it. The podcats I really enjoy it's really interesting.,5
"Worst app ever. They give songs between ads, I mean how can they even put songs between the ads , it just ruins the joyful exprience of listening to the ads. If they remove the songs I will definitely give them 5 stars.",1
"Amazing experience! All the songs and albums, whether local or international, for last 30 years I've been enjoying...are now at my fingertips at the highest quality...thanks to Spotify.",5
"This gives me the ability to play any genre of music I choose and I can literally DJ on the go , love it",5
"Great app, use it every day",5
"The problem is just becoming more unstable Like I used to use this app and other app at same time in past it used to work better but now it's stops on one song only I don't know why it stops And I updated the version again but here again that problem and again when I search for some songs the songs be like something went wrong, no internet connection etc and all Please if this continues I will not put for any premium package more I",1
Just got a full screen ad for sponsored content on premium. That's not you do to paying customers.,1
Every time adda after one song worst app😭,1
Great music app. God bless you all. Christ Jesus loves you.,5
I love this app to listen songs,5
"Stops playing every ten minutes +/- I love to listen to my podcasts while driving is during my train commute, but the recent update constantly interrupts playback, so I'll uninstall for now. It's a brilliant app otherwise.",2
Mind blowing app so easy to use and it's amazing 😉❤️,5
"The only place where I can get both music and podcasts. Great! I would not live without it. The only reason I do not have premium anymore is that I have got another music streaming service through my phone subscribtion - if I had not, I would definitely still subscribe to Spotify. Edit: have you considered adding ratings to your podcasts/songs? That would be nice.",5
All those months it not work and they have not fix this issue if I play A song it will randomly play a random song please fix this again and the next update ok manager and developer 😤,2
I have installed in my android tv but whenever i play it the tv hangs and there is no problem with the apps even though i update the spotify on time,2
Very good as I have found everything I have looked for,5
"This app is trash, needs premium to anything 😤🙄, Can't listen to Any songs I like, always bringing me to Another song, I'm already giving credit on Streaming An Artist and you can't even let me do that!!! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎",1
"I really enjoy spotify premium and have so for the last few years as a subscriber. After recently updating my phone, my spotify no longer plays anything. All my saved data is gone. The titles and playlists are there but nothing plays. It keeps saying no internet connection try again. I have followed all the troubleshooting options as well. I only just resubscribed 3 weeks ago 😞",3
This is truely the best music app I have ever used and I've tried a lot of them. I love my music and this app has all the music. From the golden oldies to the latest.,5
"It's been glitchy lately and music skips like scratched CD. And today, when I tried opening the app, it stayed at the logo and wouldn't load. I tried uninstall and install again, restarting my phone doesn't work either.",1
"Somehow varying streaming quality, maybe due to connection ...",3
The only god thing is that you can share instagram stories with that pretty lyric thing and that's it,2
Crashing and closing all the time,1
Too much ads 🥲🥲🥲,1
"Been going downhill for years (the UI to find anything is terrible, sound quality is average and when you download something it favourites it?!) but the way it struggles without an Internet connection is infuriating, it just shows a loading screen all the time, even for albums I've downloaded. I've downloaded them because I'm travelling and I know my connection is going to be bad so why am I staring at a loading screen",1
It's good but Why can I not play the song I want to play. It always plays a different song than I'm picking. And 6 skips per hour? That's stupid,1
"Well I gave it a four star rating because when I play a song it just keeps on playing the song in my playlist and I can remove the song when I fully exit the app,so it's pretty annoying. Other than that,I really like everything else just besides the annoying part.so it's a pretty good app to me",4
"Never a boring moment with Spotify,search it you will find it😊",5
I've been using this app for years but recently Somethings up with the app please fix it. Sometimes the music just starts playing but there is no way to stop it. I can't get the album cover of song I'm listening up. There has been other issues are a recent thing. Please fix it,3
"they were unexceptionally smart to give me spotify premium free for 3 months... after that 3 months i couldn't bear with the ads and i literally became a premium member for good. its the best music streaming app but fyou for taking my money by playing mind games. jk just buy premium duo with a friend, its affordable.",4
Can't open the app anymore,1
Very interesting app for music lovers,5
Great! Only problem is that sometimes it can glitch out a bit but it doesn't do that often,4
Fantastic music from top stars always available.,5
"Recently the app has been randomly losing the player. Can't close the app, can't stop what's playing. Argh! Been using the app for years and have loved it. This needs to be fixed - please! Update July 5, 2022 Seemed to have returned to normal until today - same issue. Am un-installing and re-installing.",3
Awesome app 👌 no ads,5
Best choice for listening music,5
what does it mean First you say listen 30 minutes of uninterrupted music then after one song you advertise again It would be better if you don't say it that 30 minutes of uninterrupted music,1
It would be nice if we can download music and listen offline,4
"The mobile version is absolute thrash I can't even choose the song to play, i can only choose a playlist with full of songs that i don't like.",1
This app is great. It has all of my favorite music in one playlist!!! 🕺,5
"The shuffle button isn't on all Playlist. Music stops after 10 secs even after going into the app. Also, I thought if I had the premium duo plan then it would get rid of ads. Why do ads still come up on podcast?? UPDAT: we are now in a July and it's still happening.. remind me why I pay for this sub???? First review was from back in April 2022. Maybe if the music wouldn't keep stopping randomly it would make more sense.",1
"What is going on with all the bugs? Spotiy has always been wonderful until the last few months. Bugs, skips, doesn't pop up what im currently listening to, so I can't pause or stop the music without having to close the app. I'm really hoping this gets fixed and I dont have to cancel my subscription ☹️",1
It says ad free music ad free music only in between ads 💥🔪🔪🔪😭,1
I play music on my pc. And set pc playback on mobile to. It still doesn't change songs on pc. Lags a lot. Makes it annoying. Please fix it.,3
Extensive collection with great recommendations!,5
Best free streaming app,5
All I know now is Spotify ✨🤧,5
"In general the app is good, but recently when I play music it will occasionally not show the notification to show what song is playing or the app will freeze, I also can't unhide songs. Please fix these issues.",3
"unusable, songs will not even play and the app crashes constantly",1
Very nice app to listen to your favorite artist,2
"Spotify is great except two things. #1, It would be so much funner if it notified you when people followed you or notifed others when you follow them, I'm following countless friends who have no idea. It could be so much better. And #2, if you don't pay you lose access to listening to your Playlists, YouTube music still let's you listen to your Playlists when you don't pay, the only difference is having ads or not having ads. I hate that Spotify cuts you off.",4
App works great. Many features.,5
"Now playlist only can be played, but didnt show the list so i cant skip any song i want to hear. Sometimes i want to hear song i like in the playlist multiple time.",1
"I love spotify. I can create my own playlists, and just listen for hours.",5
Had Spotify for around 10 years planning on going another 10.,5
"its a good app, good music, but the new update is horrible. Why do i have to shuffle my liked songs just to listen to music? why cant i tap on the song to listen to the full song and not a sample of the song? it doesn't really make sense but it does what its supposed to do which is play music. Also the ads make me feel like i have malware on my phone with it popping up randomly.",3
Great choices of music and seem to be for Free Speech so you get 5* from me boo,5
Stopps playing playlists after just a few minutes,1
I am fine without needing to pay for music so I get ads but I hate everything else. I should not need to pay to see what songs are in a album Suggested songs should be optional and skips do not reset at all i have not opened spotify in 5 days so HOW DO I HAVE NO SKIPS They have fixed all this so ya use spotify,5
"Love it, this app is great for creating playlists and finding the music you love. I also Love the ability to download playlists for when you have no internet.",5
"New UI with the play button in the left most just feels weird, please fix it to the standard button layout.",5
Its better to pirate musics than using this... no youtube is better.,1
"In first time, this app is disatified for me. I try to creat account but always reply to me something wrong. Free Log in,Log in with facebook, Log in with google account like that show me but can't sing in. What a uselsss app.",1
The app is great don't get me wrong the only problem is the only way to enjoy it is that you have to pay a to repeat the music you have to pay. it does give you a free trial Without entering any credit card info. but I just don't like that I have to spend money to To do anything great in the app And it also doesn't tell you when the subscription is up. but l can just go on another app and listen to it completely free and offline without paying A single penny,4
Im stuck at loading screen,1
I have never been happier with a music provider. i Tuned out after 10 years and literally thousands of dollars. It will take me the rest of my life of ALL available music to make up for it.,5
"it literally is stuck on the logo and wont let me play my songs, go to home page or anywhere its just stuck at the logo.",1
This is a grate app for music streaming.,5
Used to like it but now you have to pay for basic fetures. You are forced to listen to random songs even if your trying to listen to one song. Its annoying.,1
The computer version is way better,1
In my opinion spotify beats all of the music apps out there hands down.........,5
Removed features being used by the client base without any notice. Rather go to YouTube music then continue paying Spotify money. Bring back Spotify connect function and I'll take my review back.,1
"The Reason for less stars is the ads are becoming irritating. This app used to be having a non interrupting playback for 30 minutes or so if you saw an ad between. But now it have ads after almost every songs. And it used to have an option for checking the song by giving a 10 second or so sample of it before adding the song to a playlist if you add the songs by ""Add Songs"" option in the playlist. Now it doesn't work. Please bring it back. And Please Allow us to rearrange the songs in a playlist",2
I don't know I if it's just me but every time I play my LIKE songs it will play but later I will play song that I never liked or is interested in 😬😬,2
"This app is soo goodd i can listen to fav songs, and im not gonna find or download it in google or anything, i can just find it in spotify🤍🧡🔥",5
Very good I like all music is nice,5
It a good app BUT how can I not pick the songs I want to play and only get 6 SKIPS AN HOUR it's so annoying why can't I pick my own songs. So after 6 skips your stuck listening to songs I don't want to listen to at the moment why can't I pick the song like on every other device,2
Too much ads 😔😔😔,3
"Love you all except when the ads come in, then I just want to storm your office and dump your servers into the sea. 💛",4
I would give this 5 stars but the fact that you cant choose wich songs you want is dumb af.,1
Best music app out. Would recommend buying NYSE: SPOT,5
My Spotify app is showing a ton of music from others countries. I need American music. How do I fix that?,1
Please focus on music not add,2
I want to download spotify songs to my library on my conputer. Please advise how to do this,3
I have to say this is a great way to listen and enjoy your music 😁😁,5
Easy to use and add songs,5
"u love spotify because Jungkook, V and BTS' songs is there.",5
Good for streaming! 👏,5
Ads are good bcs tells abt new songs which are beautiful but smtimes it's is not good bcs u r listening ur fvrt song,5
"Good app, however, every time i want to add a specific song to my playlist, it shows me recommend songs rather than the song i want to look at and add. Edit: now, when ever i try to look at a new song or playlist, it gives me infinite adds. Wost music app ever. Uninstall and move to youtube people.",1
I pick a song it will change into random music,1
too much ads. don't tell me to switch to premium. don't have a card for it.,1
Great app when it works. I've tried multiple times to get it to stop playing in the background to no avail. Next option is to just delete it and cancel subscription.,2
App is hot garbage and has been for years. I pay for the service and am plagued by crashes and random stoppages. Persistent notification for playback will break for no reason. Downloads will corrupt and leave you with no offline music.,1
Spotify is the best app for listening music it has all the features I have never seen before 😄😄✌️,4
"I like this app but I hate it when we only get six skips per hour ,and when there is a song I did not put in my Playlist, I really hope that changes but overall is still good",3
"Since June I've been having lots of problems with my podcasts and songs suddenly I'm playing and It stops and I can't press stop the songs, this is really incovenience, please try to fix this ASAP this is really annoying.",2
It's a good app but there are few things bad with it it has a 6 hour wait to it when u skip like 4. Or 3 songs #2 it skips randomly for no reason #3 u can pick ur own song u just have to hope it's the first one Here is a good thing u can actually change the song without it being random in daily mixes,3
All good. I've been with them for years . One time couldn't pay my bill on time. And they paid for 2 months. Do I half to say anymore. Thank u. . J bird.,5
Way too many ads. Plays 1 or 2 songs and then multiple ads then does it again. Very annoying when trying to listen to music.,2
I haven't been able to enjoy music on any other app like I am this one (Spotify) and creating an account is completely Free!,5
Very good app.i listen to lots of music on hear,5
Ok this app is good but please remove limited skips I have the subscription for it and I love it but the free version is just so bad so make it so you have unlimited skips the ads are fine but the limited skips are just bad so please remove that,4
"worst app,,,, its like a ad hub",1
Make the ads a little shorter and its all good,5
I can't play the music that I want to listen the whole albums starts playing.. please fix that thing up,1
"Dear spotify, your app is great. But my eyes bleed when i see the background color of lyrics on desktop version. Please change it to softer color.",4
"I thought Deezer was bad but Spotify I can't even login, keeps saying you're offline when I'm definitely online. I can't be stressing my brains just to access music, I'm out",1
Would be great but the 5 30 second ads kinda ruin it,4
"What the heck is going on with this app? It was great and now it skips and when I open the app to turn off what I'm listening to, the player at the bottom has disappeared and I can't turn it off without closing the app. Restarting the phone and the app only helps temporarily. Reinstalling the app only works temporarily. I have loved Spotify but am considering switching to Amazon Music because of this nonsense.",1
This app is the best way to listen to music,5
"Great app I've been using it for years and have paid for my subscription. For the last few days there is no way to stop, skip or fast forward the songs. I have to close the entire window to get music to stop playing. Please fix.",4
"Spotify app on PC is great, you can't doubt that. Although the moment you just wanna travel with music on a phone its so horrible, theres this bug possibly where you're locked on shuffle mode. You can't even have fun with music anymore because Spotify does everything possible to make it unfun.",2
It's a good music app but I don't understand why I just cannot continue to skip freely from one track to another. Why restrict the number of times one can skip tracks while listening to a playlist.,3
Suddenly if u put songs in shuffle..the first song plays again and again Please do check this,3
The quality of music got worse when i got premium the transitions between songs slowed down and wouldn't load as fast,5
"two days ago all songs from playlists i listened to were showed in the history of songs i listened to recently as just songs, i mean there weren’t any playlists and then songs from them, just songs. it confuses searching now, nothing has changed yet. i need answers, i have no idea what’s happening, and it extremely complicates using this app. upd: why can’t i download music lol? what now? nothing changed either.",1
Great app! One problem! Stop politicizing the ads! I download it to listen to music not hear about LGBTQ or abortion or vaccines.,3
Can't open the app anymore. What the heck is going on?,1
Great tunes and selection,5
Been listening to Spotify for years. Never have been asked to rate it. Got a new phone and it wants to know what I think. If I didn't like it I'd be using another platform.,5
"it's a wonderful music app, and i definitely recommend. however, one issue i have is the imbalance between the different platforms. pc, almost everything you want from the app besides ""no ads"". tablet, quality is kinda the same on PC, but different because it's a tablet. phone, god, it needs to improve. ads, sure whatever, i get it. but not being able to choose what song to listen to and only 6 skips an hour? what if someone can't afford a tablet or PC? rethink this, because it's stupidly unfair",4
The recent update has rendered this the most annoying app on my phone. Constantly losing the playing bar. Used to work without issues. Huawei p30 Pro,1
I've been usthis for a while and figured they deserved of this reading I've been using this and I've never had no problems with it it's a little expensive but worth it,5
Really love playing spotify,5
"Nvm, free spotify sucks",3
"Wow... I moved from ios to Android and the lack of care for Android is astonishing. I'm a software engineer and I would have been fired months ago if I released something this buggy and didn't even bother to fix it. This is not acceptable. It's not that it's buggy, it's that there is no care to fix it. Each new release makes the app more and more unstable. Probably priority is ios and Android just gets the crumbs.",1
Best music streaming service I have ever used. UI is simple and sophisticated. Spotify also features many personalization options that makes the app feel like it was built for you.,5
"I really don't care about the random pauses in the music. What upsets me is that after 14 days, everything is on shuffle. Like, you cannot pick a certain song on a playlist. Basically, it is forcing you to buy premium or else you will always be annoyed.",3
"The best ever music app after Google play store, with great quality sound n other effects. Specially the premium plan is so worth it. 👍😉😇",5
Nice listening to wonderful music!,5
"Don't use this app, don't give your money to Spotify. Switch to bandcamp and actually support artists and not be force fed platform exclusives daily or be bombarded with ads in your listening. Latest update appears to have completely borked the shuffle function, frequently goes over songs that were playing only minutes before.",1
"Spotify is very greedy, as in the free plan it puts shuffle on and it can't be turned off at all, and so many other things like that are added so you have to get premium. Not worth it, get Pandora.",1
"Can't listen to music, playlists for ALL are showing empty. Tried Uninstalling, clearing cache, rebooting...nothing has helped. I have a paid subscription and can't use the service. Update: Customer support was quick to address the issue and offered an easy solution to the problem. Thank you.",5
"Well, what does this app offer that needs rating? It collects and plays the work of others well. Displays the artwork of others well. Its homepage is straight bad and mostly pushing things I will never and have never clicked on. They should have a ""simple"" mode that gets rid of all the faff and lets you just listen to music. After all, it doesn't pay its artists, so why does it need to advertise? I already pay for it!",3
It's a good app Just I don't like how I have to spend so much a month and only 6 skips pur hour it's should be six skips pur 30 minutes so when a add comes on we will get some skips,4
It was nice and I loved to listen to music to drown out the noises or to draw but one day I was off to listen to music but it didn't let me choose music and I thought it was a glitch so I uninstalled the app the reinstalled it back but it still happened please put it to that we can choose the song and not randomize it,2
"Why won't my Playlist restart? I keep starting my Podcast so I can draw stuff but then it'll start in the middle of a song and it'll completely throw off the mood, Why won't it restart the playlist instead of picking some random song to start in and then play that song and not let me to skip",3
"I pay for my monthly subscription and the same day it quits working. Tried uninstalling,, clearing data, clearing cache, restarting etc. Can't get past initial logo screen. So who's refunding my money????",1
"It has alot of songs of any genre, and if you pay the premium then it just gets better and better, 10/10 recommended",5
The February update broke Spotify connect to my car's Bluetooth radio is no longer able to connect to Spotify,2
"I can't play any song that I pick, randomly cuts halfway through a song and 6 skips an hour shouldn't be a feature, I have no trouble with this on a console, like PlayStation but this is just generally unusable.",1
You can't even listen to the songs you put on playlist and it keeps on shuffling to the song you doesn't even know and don't want to play. The Spotify sucks now so it deserves 1 star,1
"WHAT HAPPEN TO THE CANVAS? I can't skip to next songs (both on phone and Bluetooth), cannot select loop, random, or direct, can't see the lyrics, and can't skip through songs. PLEASE FIX THIS",4
"I am begging you, improve the offline functionality. Song that are supposed to be downloaded won't play, the menues are buggy as hell offline and half the time will just not load, sometimes I can't even pull up my library.",3
I did love using Spotify! Not anymore since I'm ANNOYED that ALL of my playlists are gone for some reason...,1
I really like it. Easy to use and customize.,5
"Great app, always has up to date music and I can generally always find the songs I'm looking for. I hate ad's so it's definitely worth the monthly subscription. I love listening to music while commuting and Spotify helps make the journey less boring.",5
"a new updaye and same issue as below. last time I had to contact support to fix it. used to love it. a few weeks ago after an update, I stopped seeing a notification in my pull down menu. The app is also switching to playing on the phone after I turned the car off post Bluetooth. Neither of these were ever an issue, I changed nothing about my phone setup.",2
"Right now as soon as I start vacation it is not working, not loading. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, forced stopped, restarted my phone. This is beyond annoying!!! Edit, got a new phone and app still not working!!! Everyone else in my family plan has a working spotify except myself and I am the plan account holder.",1
I'm an artist and Spotify doesn't even let me listen to my own song. It keeps playing other songs that I don't like :)),1
"Great music,all the songs l grew up with at the push of a button.",5
We love our Spotify!,5
Excellent perfomence with greatest hearing experience... The sound system 💯,5
I love Spotify so much but I have two reasons why I don't like it. 1) I hate the ads. 2) premium is good but expensive and it made me broke,3
The only reason I returned to this God awful app is to watch jre. Although I haven't been able to in over a year because their mobile app is so poorly made I'll end up waiting five minutes for something to load just for it to buffer every twenty seconds without fail. Beyond frustrating to use even without the ads. I couldn't recommend this app any less and I personally believe an honest to God 8-track would be an improvement to whatever the hell Spotify claims to be.,1
Easy to use and very popular so it has a wide selection of music,5
everything costs. And the random songs being added to your playlist is annoying.,3
"Fix the app! Keeps crushing, plays what ever it wants, doesn't react, if I want to switch it off I need to close it from the background.",1
The sound quality and other features are exceptional.,5
how come when we use spotify on computer we can loop for free but when we use it on phone we gotta pay. cmon man thats just stupid,3
Good music i can find heheh even old music hehe,5
Whenever I open the app and numerous times while using it I get a message that I should turn on Bluetooth. I know Bluetooth is off. I turned it off. There are no Bluetooth devices where I am. It has become so annoying that I am looking for an alternative,2
Spotify is great for listening to albums. And it's cool to be able to make playlists.,5
"Spotify gives you access to a lot of music, but often fails at functionally working. It doesn't have all the albums I want but has an interesting way of recommending new music.",3
"If I were to compare, Spotify is the best music app for me. I love the interface sm! Although there are some bugs and stuffs, they didn't hinder me much from having a good experience in this app. I hope you'd add more songs and improve the sound quality just like AM (it's already good but I don't think it would hurt if you make it better hehe)",4
My app won't even open... I have tried reinstalling it and it still won't work..,1
Good but can be a bit confusing and difficult. Sometimes u search and play ur particular song and pops up a total different one . Spotify should really work on that,3
The app will not open to the log in page,1
"FIX SPOTIFY, I have explicit content on, yet it won't let me play the songs, FIX THIS PLEASE.",1
You can't always view video or track at what point in the audio the song is. Why? This is a problem that Amazon and YouTube do not encounter.,3
"Spotify was great until all of a sudden I logged out for 1 quick second and now I can't load into the app and I'm stuck in the loading screen with the logo for the past 3 days, it'd be 5 stars if this was fixed.",2
"Been having this problem recently where I am only stuck on a Spotify logo basically the loading screen where I have to wait before it loads. I've been waiting a lot just to see the damn loading screen for hours. I tried uninstalling and redownloading it but nothing works I tried a lot of ways such as restarting my phone, clearing data and cache, refreshing the app but nothing happens just that damn logo and a black screen surrounding it. I can't believe this. Fix this damn app.",1
"Spotify was best in the beggining, you can play any song you like and I believe to be add free, However like 1 month after download when I click a song It doesn't even even play the song I chose. I don't know if this happens with other people on Mobile however it is very annoying click a song only to hear something else.",2
"Free spotify tends to get more insidious the more you use it to frustrate you into paying for premium, to the point that it would play 2 songs then 3 ads repeatedly",1
"After using over five(5) music 🎵 apps , this is one of many I give a five(5)+🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🔥 In which I enjoy sharing With family and friends. Also , you can creat your Own playlist 🎧🎶🎵🎧 And share .... 🔝#1🎭✨✨👍",5
It doesn't let u choose what music you want to listen to one u press on a play list it goes on shuffle and u can't change that unless u buy premium,1
"The last time I tuned in, it kept flicking from one song to another, and wouldn't let me listen to the song that I wanted to.",3
"It just stops playing music and podcast it will work for a song or two or 10 minutes into a podcast then it just stops, play bar is going like you just started the app up, doesn't remember that played a song or where it stopped in song or podcast. Then you have to go back in the app find where you stopped hearing the content. Got full bars, 5G unlimited plan no where near the ramp down limit so it's not that. Pandora and utube music play just fine. Starting to wonder why I pay for this when it",2
"It's nice, but there are too many things to pay for",4
"My spotify has been working fine for 5 years. i cleared the app data to clear some space on my phone. Now when I click onto the app, it doesnt go pass the green logo which im stuck on. Cant get to the login screen or anything. PLEASE FIX THIS spotify is my lifeeeeeee",3
I mostly use the app for exclusive podcasts like JRE and appreciate Spotify as company as a whole but the app crashes all the time. Frequently when I go to listen to a podcast the podcast doesn't come up so if it has video I can't see it or skip ahead or go back within the podcast its as if the app doesn't register its playing. If the app was more reliable I would like consider using it for music and upgrade to premium account but the frustration isn't worth it.,2
sptify is a nice app . but it dosent let us enjoy the music. Ads every second and only 5skips a day! its forcing the user to pay. and thats lame .pls let some freedom for the useres so they dont hate this app.,1
Easy to use and provides great suggestions!,5
Found the app easy to use and your options are limitless,5
Last update won't let the app open!!!!,1
"My music the way I want it, where I want it... when I want it. Love the Spotify App!",5
Thumbnail is other artists and songs item list of another artist,1
The stupidest app really. You take premium for a week and you can download only 30 songs?! Disgusting. Never spending one more penny on this useless app.,1
"I love spotify and use is all the time,but the only thing that I don't like about spotify is that it doesn't play all of the songs on the playlist before it repeats some of the songs. But other than that I would definitely recommend it.",4
"I love spotify. It not only has music I like it also has podcasts that fit my interests. And I don't mean sport or anime podcast even though I haven't looked. I'm talking crime, supernatural, or scary type podcasts.",5
Spotify is an awesome music app.,5
Trash app wouldn't even use if Joe Rogan hadn't moved over. Literally randomly just changed podcasts and pauses for no reason all the time.,1
"I've been using this app for 4 years,but the new update is getting on my nerves.If you want to listen to a song you can't listen to it first if you even wanted to, instead it puts the songs in a order where you can't choose which one you wanna listen to first. Not only that, but when I tap on a song to listen to it instead of showing the play button it shows other songs and not the one I wanted to listen to. It is also frustrating when I wanna play a song on my playlist.",1
No issue and encountered eversince I installed this app super users friendly and was to link to my car and bt speaker.,5
I love spotify so much.,5
"Constantly stopping, regularly not showing playback options and offline mode is spotty at best.",2
Why the hell cant i play my playlist do i need to shuffle it? Stop trying to give me songs that are like the songs in my playlist. Just let me listen to my damn songs its annoying,2
"The app has horrendous lag on my Note 10+ yet works fine on my brother's phone, I am fully updated to the newest version I can, and the issue persists. There is something deeply wrong with this app, and it needs to be figured out soon.",1
"Many problems with this app. #1 You can’t even play the songs you want. Every time I shuffle play liked songs or my own playlists it just plays songs that aren’t even there. #2 Too much ads. #3 Whenever I search for a song, I have to go through every single playlist that appeared till I find the one I want, sometimes I don’t even find it. #4 You have 6 skips every hour but can’t even play what you want so I just skip to the song I want but then my skips are just wasted. You need to fix this.",1
"Really knows how to setup the music, great system 👍",5
"The app has such a variety of music and gives new artist so you dont get bored of your favorite artist, however despite the apps quality the add situation is a little abnocious having to pay a fair price with no adds and offline music is a fair deal still the adds should depend on how many months/years your account was created so the longer you have uour account the less adds.",4
This app is so annoying....after the last update all playlist has under go on shuffle mood and you cant disable it without buy a premium...... and you cant change song over 6 time..... this is so disappointing..... I am going to uninstall this app,1
Sometimes it's laggy for me. Crashes often too...(　；∀；)...,5
"Since mid May 2022, I can't play anything on Spotify. All of my playlists are either empty or have like 2 songs on them. Even official Spotify playlists are empty. Edited: There's been 4 updates since this post and I still can't listen to any music. I pay for this and I can't use it. The website works but I can't download a playlist there so I have to use my mobile data. I'll be switching to Pandora, I guess. I prefer Spotify but I can't use it! 😡",1
Keeps asking to allow Bluetooth. I have said yes and later and it won't stop every time I open the app. So annoying,1
I will be in the middle of a podcast and it'll change to another episode of a different podcast,2
"Even with autoplay off for similar songs, whenever I start playing a playlist it plays songs that are suggested and not from the actual Playlist.",1
"Great when it works, haven't had too many issues on the Pixel 6 Pro. Control bar is missing with latest update",3
I Used to Love This app a Lot.... Many Amazing Songs and everything is so perfect 🙂😇,2
I love spotify to be honest wichall,5
Spotify is okay but I can't loop it or choose my song. YouTube let's me do that. I can do that on my computer Spotify but not mobile. It sucks.,3
Too many ads like gawd I know I have to pay for premium you don't need to give me three 30 seconds long ads continuously Even once is enough,4
Since I updated the app won't open.,1
I love the app and the premium prices are reasonable. The only problem I have is that it's a bit tedious adding songs to a playlist.,5
I really enjoy this app. The weekly discovery is awesome!,5
The songs are amazing,5
"Keeps saying no internet, when set to offline, when stuff I'm trying to play is downloaded stuff? Turn to online with my wi fi same gd thing? Worked great for years now this? Why do i pay for premium?",1
The progress bar issue was fixed and it is the great app it used to be once again,5
"It's all about the money first of all when I want to listen to a certain playlist via artist or made by myself ,IT ALWAYS PLAY ""SUGGESTED"" SONGS. It so irritating because let alone I can't chose the song I can't get more than 6 skips an hour when it's playing song that shouldn't even be there . I liked it better when the subscription was unlimited skips and no ads 😌😌😌",3
"Big fan, keeps doing really weird things like not showing that it's playing, unable to fast forward or rewind because I can't get to the song playing, gives me random adds and won't let me skip by then even though I have the payed version.",3
Great so far haven't had to deal with advertising yet,5
"Just a cash grab at this point, they stopped giving me my 30 minutes of uninterrupted music and I don't know why, I can only skip 6 songs (and it's extremely frustrating when a song I don't know comes on that I didn't put on my playlist) I can't even chose the song I want to listen to and the audio keeps skipping during the songs, just use an adblocker website and listen to music that way guys",1
There was like 1 billion ads and I didn't even get the songs I wanted,1
Its a great app for music and in my opinion the best,4
Not having 30 minutes of commercial listening.,2
Forget this. Im going back to Youtube. At least there i can listen to the songs i want instead of my 30 ad free minutes being recommendeds of what i listened to last week. 10/10 do not recommend this app. Alot of problems built into the app on purpose just to pressure people into buying their premium. Premium in their case being a decent app that just lets you listen to your music which i shoukd get anyway. Total ripoff,1
Whenever I try to play songs it just plays a random song. Unusable.,1
I try to play the song on my Play list and Play songs I didn't add,2
Love this app but kinda silly how you have to pay to listen i mean seriously! I rather listen to my music on YouTube.,2
I LOVE the more like this tab for podcasts! I love it so much I closed out the app and rated it after years of having Spotify 😂 definitely need more changes like this!!!!! Comment section next?? 👀👀👀,4
I started payin for Spotify but is stops playing. I don't know why. Actually i am paying exactly for its playin in background. But it doesn't. Play button disappeared anyway. I can not shut it down. Unbelievable!,1
Plays songs that I didnt even add to my playlist,1
"Works okay at the moment, but there's a slight issue where the genre slider at the top of the liked songs list cannot slide. :)",3
Great app and music 🎶,5
♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️🎴DONT DOWNLOAD Bad app for misic it contains frequently ad 2:1RATIO OF ADS,1
Currently the play bar is disappearing from the bottom of the app constantly. Extremely frustrating and yet marked as resolved according to their website. Will be leaving 1 star review until this is fixed properly because it's a core feature that should never be broken (for an extended period of time at that) in a music app.,1
Great music definitely a great app to have.,5
Very good app for music and podcast. But ads are too frequent.,4
I love the selection of music. Oldies that I knew my granny loved that I couldn't find elsewhere.,5
Any other Android users having issues with the app? I've read alot of us are experiencing the same issue after updating the app..once it's updated and you try to reopen it stays stuck on the logo....its trying to load up but never does! Extremely frustrating when you can't speak to a human. All Bots when trying to resolve the issue! Back to Pandora I go!😭😭😭💔💔💔,1
I love Spotify!! I have ALWAYS been able to find every song I'm looking for and every podcast too. Paying for premium is 100% worth it. Spotify is THE BEST app and I choose it over all the others out there. Thanks for being amazing Spotify 👍😁.,5
"Was terrible, couldn't stand using the app with ads and limited skips... then I got premium. Now, all I ever use is Spotify. No ads, no taking up phone space, and pretty much all the music I listen to. Sometimes I have an itch for a song that isn't available on Spotify, so I just YouTube it and carry on with my day. The only subscription I won't be getting rid of any time soon :D",5
"Offline mode takes a while to respond, an issue that has plagued 3 of my phones (2x Samsung, 1x oppo many android update, app updates and years later still.",4
Spotify is great!,5
Too many problems not getting fixed! Anyone that pays should get a free month! 🤬,1
"Everything is almost alright. Whenever I play my liked songs shuffled, after couple of my liked songs are played a little after you play song THAT I NEVER LIKED WHY PLAY THEM WHEN I HAVEN'T LIKED THEM. FIX THIS. Not only that every 10 minutes i get an add. Don't hmu with the bs of not bothering you with adds for 30 minutes. THANKS FOR DISABLING MY ACCOUNT AFTER I WROTE THIS, everything was fine before I rated this.",1
Performance is very poor When i search for music and I tap the play button it play different much,1
"Great desktop version, free version on app is obviously worse. You get what you (don't) pay for I guess. Appreciate that ads are needed but there seem to be significantly more. That's a minor whinge. The fact the app throws random songs into your playlists is extremely annoying.",2
Changing my review from 1 star for the free version. I just got a student subscription and the app works super fast. I am able to listen to songs in different languages (a lot of them with lyrics). The playlists are also useful as I can discover new songs. Spotify has got to be the best music player in the world right now. :),5
Spotify was good untill they started the 8 ads in a row deal,1
Constantly crashes with podcasts which is annoying. Plus the podcast video player could really use an update.,3
"Very happy, thanks A very good range of fantastic music Kind regards from Ollie from freezing Frankston 3199 Victoria lol",5
"I tried logging in but I keep receiving an error message of ""offline kindly connect to the internet"" which Is very annoying because I'm very sure I'm connected to the internet.Not until I uninstall and reinstall and now I have to redownload my songs.",2
"I've been using and paying for Spotify premium since I was in 7th grade. I am now a college sophomore and thinking of cancelling my well-loved subscription because of the constant skipping of songs. I don't know why or when exactly the problem started, but almost every song skips like a bad record and I haven't found a single effective solution. reinstalling, reporting the bug, opening and closing ect ect. I love this app and I would hate to lose it, but this issue is incredibly frustrating.",2
New update is horrible. Not being able to pick which song and my playlist constantly shuffling. I recommend SoundCloud or YouTube Music.,2
"great music app, only problem is that the shuffle feature isnt actually random and it picks the same handful of songs each time.",4
Best app in the world for music lovers1♥️,5
Great music selection..,4
Voice is very clear and good,3
"App constantly plays the same songs regardless of using shuffle. For example, today while not driving the app is playing all the songs it played yesterday while driving. Sucks.",1
"I will never pay for Spotify. It's a scam. Literally every other song is an ad an then when I am able to catch a commercial free period, you guys ruin it. How do you let a 4 minute song go over 6 mins and had I not used one of your skips my whole 30 minutes would have been wasted on 1 song. It's absolutely ridiculous",1
It plays every song I could ever imagine having to think of and it is very useful,5
This is everything I needed thank you spotify,5
Absolutely Stunning! More like they know my soul and give me what i want. 🖤,5
"What is up with free Spotify. I get that I'm not going to get the best version of the app but you only have 6 skips. The 6 skips are that bad but pair it with when you play a playlist it just plays random songs that aren't even on your playlist. So you skip those song but then the app is like: ""woah slow down instead of skipping try editing your playlist?"" And you can't edit your playlist because it's playimg random songs. And when you search noooo it has to play more random songs.",1
Use any other app. Constantly stops playing for no reason. Sometimes stopping after 5 minutes or less.,1
"The best app ever they is no song I cannot fine hear toms up ,👍👍👍",5
"Loved it, but then the app started getting really buggy and now it thinks there's no Internet access when I can easily connect with other apps. Going to cancel subscription.",1
Its a great app but.. Since the new update spotify is just no💀 you cant even play your fav song over and over why did you removed that in the app idk whos idea to put random songs in your playlist who EVER thought of that is a horrible idea,1
Had to uninstall and reinstall for the second time due to years-old bug triggered by app updates when spotify set to offline mode. Cannot login unless I do this.,3
Really great app I got what am paying for couldn't be happier 😊,5
Why pay for premium if there's still going to be ads every 7 minutes? Is there something more I have to do to turn the ads off??,1
Super sound quality,5
"It's great n all but it has an issue when I'm using it,it only has the logo and it won't open I hope you guys fix this.😐",4
"The app has been getting more and more buggy and even with a subscription, I get pop-ups advertising in-app podcasts I have no desire to listen to.",1
"Every couple of months the app's 'fun' side rears it's ugly head. I'm talking the sound cutting out for no reason till you open the app again, downloaded files that are in the downloads folder not playing till you're back on wifi or turn your data back on and the app not showing on your device that anything is playing when it clearly is. As we speak, Spotify started playing again randomly after cutting out for 10 minutes. Thanks Spotify.",1
Literally can't live without Spotify. By far the superior music experience in my opinion 🤷🏼‍♀️😅,5
"Lol. Idk why did I bother to came here. The app doesn't work at all. It just show the logo, no matter how long I try to wait, and that's it. I can't even log in to my account. Tried to uninstall and reinstall for several times but it's just useless.",1
I love the fact that I can listen to whatever kind of music I like!,5
100% satisfied with this app. We can search and hear any songs and make playlist. Love this app👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,5
"Even after paying for premium, it's not getting reflected.",5
This app has changed my music experience. Thanks guys!,5
Constantly has player issues where it'll randomly stop playing and you need to reinstall to fix it. Just use the browser version instead.,1
It really good but entire it was 👎 good because it didn't have the song on everyone time,5
"I've been having issues connecting with remote play, my phone doesn't allow me to play songs directly from my favorite/hearted songs. Edit: This has been an issue for almost a year.. half the time I can't play music unless I click the shuffle button, it doesn't let me select individual songs. Not sure what I'm paying for at this rate. Tested on two Pixels and a Moto.. Edit 2: still broken two months later, collectively over a year. should i just give up??",1
"Don't like the advertisements so much. Lately they've been getting lengthy with sometimes 5 in a row, which throws a wrench in my workout.",2
Good for nothing this app is. They have to update themselves. If not nother Yahoo.,1
Every songs are here best app like instagram and also BTS songs are here each and every,5
Could do better at loading when in offline mode since it's all already downloaded,4
Love Spotify.. My music go to..,5
Very easy to use. Updated gebra of music.,5
This is very good app to listen song and sing with that by reading lyrics.,5
It is alright but as soon as the premium runs out it sucks because if you try to play a song you searched up you just get some other song instead of what you clicked on so basically you have to pay to listen to the music that you want also it now sometimes refuses to give me my six skips per hour because I used it yesterday and today used three skips and it said that I have used my six skips also not to mention it now gives me almost three ads in one ad and the thirty minutes don't work anymore,1
Super super it's all no words Better than these app *gana app *Hangama * Jio savan Great work from Spotify .,5
"Poor...30 seconds ads never felt like they last a long time till now. Especially when you're just trying to play music. I get that they need money...but bro...right in the middle of the Playlist? What's the point of listening your favorite song If an ads ruins your mood, hype and vybe just because you don't have premium.",1
This app is a nice app for music and podcast and there are my favourite artist,5
I think it is the worst app ever i have used. This app is showing ads after every 1 or 2 songs which is really a pathetic thing. I don't want to gibe even 1 star also but without it the review won't be posted.,1
i cant open the app : ( tried installing-uninstalling the app multiple times already... still not responding,1
New update... Why shuffle play button dissappear in liked songs? I want to get random music. There is only play/stop button and second button to loop playing. Please return it back!,4
Best app for podcasts ....best suggestion.but the ads are annoying so Spotify make sure you reduce the amount of ads,5
"All good 👍. I can change even the cover of my playlists , What else do I need. But there should also be an option to turn off notification of any artist.",5
"Love it!!! Nothing else to say that would be better than ""love it!!!""",5
"After this last update the app won't even open ok my phone, it's just stuck on the loading screen",1
"I loved spotify, but the most recent update makes it where I can't pick what song is playing, and it just plays randomly and never plays music on my playlist anymore, if this is the new Spotify, I will be deleting Spotify and use something else, now I also can't see what is even on my playlist anymore, it just has a list and not a playlist",1
Tired of your ads 😑 uninstalling it😑,1
Fantastic for music lovers.. On point!,4
"Y'all should add some features that will make the app incredible. One, add a feature that can allow users to play all offline songs. Two, add a supermix. And three, add two tabs on the home page that will say ""music"" and ""podcast"" it's time to separate music from podcast. Also, make it easy to download podcast episodes. I want to enjoy a podcast show without any pausing(buffering). Maybe auto download.",1
Annoying. Stop shuffling my music!,1
Great selection of classic period music from the sixties ...,4
Awesome because now I can hear my favorite songs,5
Doesn't let me skip recommended songs even when I had skips left,2
smoothly find out all my favourite music,5
The app is not working properly . Dwonloaded songs were shown in llibarary but not play and now dwonloaded songs column is not shown on my library . me also buy the premium for dwonload song Worst app I have ever used,1
"Best music app. Ecosystem of this app is very convenient, seamless connection with PlayStation and smart TVs.",5
Failure to launch. Even after multiple unistall and reistall doesn't get passed icon screen. 0/5 stars not Samsung friendly.,1
"App always going off lately! Very annoying. I thought I was the only one, but reading reviews here, many facing same issue.",1
Keeps crashing when I open it.,1
It's a great app but you can't really choose the song you want to play and if you run out of so g that your playlist randomized it just gives you random song that you might not even like and then pretty much forces you to buy premium,4
So I was using Spotify for the last two years and now am having some issues. Whenever I get a message notification from WhatsApp then notification beep sound continues. No matter what I try the beep sound continues. I don't know whether it's happening because my phone have some bugs or Spotify having some issues. Need an explanation if it's possible.,1
👏 amazing! I often have to restart app to fix glitch but worth it!,5
"No mather what i do, it will keep playing. I close and it playes again.. damn stupid app...",1
Goood all search enjoy songs,4
"🪶.... Spotify is the absolute best music and podcast app Ever, I couldn't live without it now... Soooo much better than YouTube the fact one can play a podcast in the background whilst doing other things on my handheld device makes it an absolute cut above the rest & the amount of free quality entertainment is mind blowing..Thank you Spotify xoxo",5
Great app and amazing wide variety of content. Ads are not too loud or frequent in free use. Price of premium is very fair and totally worth it!,5
I think this app is great though the only thing i wish that it has was the loop the song forever although i think it is a premium function and it is alright i think it is a 4.5 around there. Definitely better than youtube music in all other parts though especially the ads experiece wow you can listen to a whole hour of spotify and hardly any advertisements would pop out,4
Why the app always force stop... After few it will stop.,1
I like the app but i hate hattteee when i try to find songs they are shuffled with others songs i dont like and also my playlist,2
"How do you turn it off when you're done listening,instead of just pausing???",3
Sound quality is very good 🙂😊😊,5
I've been getting bugs. Pause button won't appear. The bottom thingy won't appear when I'm playing a song. I keep restarting the app but it doesn't fix it.,3
What happened??? I can't pause it anymore. When I play something I don't get any of the buttons showing up on my phone. I can't pause and it won't even show what I'm listening to. I've even had it play right over other apps like books. It's become complete garbage.,1
I should have Given you 5 Star. But I rather give 3 star. Because Spotify is a excellent App. But the monthly payment is extremely expensive $9.99 .you guys should do like $5 .So to have many subscribers. e. g Am 37 years old and if I will be listening to music for about 20 to come. How much will it cost in twenty years of my living on this Earth?,3
When I was enter this app it's took more time to loading,1
Why there is no previous feature in my application this also a updated version then why I don't have fix this issue fast................... As soon as possible ............🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,1
App won't open. Just crashes,1
Keeps playing stuff other than the play list I created,3
Blend wins all the stars. I'd give one extra if I could.,5
I love the Spotify service it gives me my choice of any song or album I want to play and I just love it keep up the great work,5
Good sound quality 👌,3
"I love the download features, and the wide variety.",5
It's the best app for music,5
"Its a great app. Its just that my songs arent playing fully, So please fix this",4
"Gives me a blank spotify logo on a black screen when i try to log in, and has been ""loading"" for over 20 minutes. im paying 11.99 a month for this?",1
Super music app high quality misic,5
"I really do enjoy using this app but recently there has been an issue that has been bugging me. Anytime I try to play music offline, some songs in the playlist do not play (I use premium). I would have to go online in order for them to play. I haven't had this problem before so I presume it's an issue from the app, it's quite annoying and I'd like if it's fixed",4
Need a very very very high connection,1
"I used to use YT vanced, it was a good app for BG music then i downloaded this, no doubt this is a good music streaming app but ads after every song?? One ad says that 30 mins interrupted songs and after that song again there is a ad, disappointed",1
how to remove the recommended songs on my spotify playlist cus i wanna pick which song i should play first,4
It's a really good app with amazing pod casts and songs i loved but the thing is that i gave 4 stars is after some time ads are coming too much hope you'll work on it and i recommend you all to use this app,4
"7.5.22 App has been glitchy the last few days. Podcasts stop every 10 minutes. No control buttons, can't pause or back up. Normally this is fixed in short order but it's been too long. I mostly like this app. One ask I have is to make autoplay settings separate for podcasts. Depending on where I am when I select an episode, a new one may or may not autoplay at the end. I want autoplay for music but not for podcasts... please and thank you! Also shuffle available from the top of all playlists?",2
I like this app cause i can hear every song,5
The daily mix is the same music every day nothing new. Don't now wy they mix it every day with the same music.,1
It's an absolute cheating against those people who don't buy Spotify Premium... Because there are 3 long nasty ads after each and every song... I'll delete my account if you don't reduce those long ads after every song...,2
It's audio is really clear as well as there is smooth transition between 2 songs and it recommends music with careful consideration. Great for listening offline,4
One of the best music applications I've used.,5
Spotify's good reputation is well deserved. Their recommendation system is first rate; the user experience is very strong and is regularly improved with updates.,5
Nights with lovely songs is awesome,4
It's great to be able to listen to a album of my choice,5
Will pause songs randomly of you don't give the app permission to run 24/7 in thr background without restrictions on android. I do t want it starting or running in the background when I am not using it. It acts like I lost signal when using it if I have it as a sleeping app when not in using it. I canceled my premium membership because of this issue. Why pay for music that skips because you don't want it running all the time when not in use.,2
Completely unusable app. Literally crashes when you attempt to launch it. Don't know why I pay for their service.,1
"PODCASTS DO NOT PLAY. I PAY FOR PREMIUM, MUSIC WORKS BUT NOT PODCASTS.",1
"Loved spotify and have used premuim, meaning I pay, for years now. HOWEVER, for at least two months now the app has been crashing, randomly pausing my music, and not displaying any banner or display for the active audio. I've been very patient and stuck with an app I have appreciated, but that might change if spotify does not fix these issues soon.",2
"I loved this app so much! I used it every day for hours and got premium. But recently my account won't let me play anything, and it changed the entire set up of my library, removing all my playlists. I tried to make another account and it's the same thing! I would be so happy if you could fix it! Because I love this app, I just can't play anything! (Problem solved! Thanks Spotify!)",5
More data it's taking 30 min 400 mb it took,1
"One of the great apps for those who are good listeners, interested in music and songs.",5
THIS SUCKS i literally picked eroplanong papel and other songs play like what? Spotify fix this and ill give you a better review its rlly annoying you better do something about this!,2
Great music app. Only issue with it is that it sometimes stops. I have close it down and reopen it but this doesn't happen very often.,4
"No controls visible anymore. (Play, pause, etc) My app will stop playing for no reason. This just started over the last few days. Without the play / pause option, I cannot pause my podcast or music when someone comes to speak with me. Additionally, the app keeps playing despite receiving phone calls.",3
"Too many ads,not playing the correct song that i choose.",2
Love it. Getting all my favorites.,5
"Randomly skips my songs, won't let me pick specific songs in my playlist, literally missing basic functions you can find in 99% of other music players if you don't buy premium, they want to make it as mind numbing and painful to use their app as possible so you can give them money for something that others can give you for free! Atleast with youtube I can pick songs from my playlist to play without skipping through my playlist with shuffle.",1
"Spotify rocks it, got kicked off YouTube for expressing my first amendment rights of free speech and don't miss communist Marxist YouTube at all, thanks Spotify!!!!",5
I update new update of spotify then I open the app then my library is deleting my library song fix this issue,1
Love creating my own playlists!,5
Happy but I don't need ads it's disturbing me,5
Awesome experience but add is annoying,5
"An ad every other song, glitches all the time. Suggested songs are repetative and annoying.",2
"Great music, good choice.",5
Love this so far! 👌 i only use a few times a year....i just dont have the time.,4
I love it and hate it at the same time. I want to able to skip songs when it's an artists playlist. But other that that you good.,3
My Spotify is not opening I am trying from so long but no response please fix this problem as soon as possible whenever I open it the logo of Spotify appears and it doesn't go for for so long I keep waiting that when will it open and when will I be able to enjoy the songs please fix this problem I want to use Spotify I haven't use it from so long,1
I love the diversity of music. Real Caribbean rhythm,5
A complete app for collection if favourite songs,5
Way too many ads,2
I can't live without spotify 💚,5
"What has happened to this app? Where has the now playing screen gone? No way to control what's happening on the app anymore. I can't rewind, I can't skip the inbeded grifter ads by the podcasters or rewind and listen to something interesting.",3
Full package when it comes to music,5
"Love it been using it for a while, the liked song play list is awesome though I massively wish there'd be a 'relaxing' genre tab for sorting if it does that in the future I'll easily give it 10 stars",5
Poor user interface. You have to wait >10s for albums to load even when offline. Why does the app keep trying to connect when in offline mode and phone airplane mode??,1
"App is great! They should tell you though that after an update you should restart your phone, you know, just like your computer so your update can take effect!",5
I shuffle thousands of songs and it's always the same 10 scattered at the beginning.,3
This is the best app for song's,4
"Very buggy lately (July 2022). The app constantly bugs out, loosing the now playing bar and becoming unresponsive. The only way to stop play back is to force stop the app.",2
"Pretty good other than the queue option. When you want to go to the previous queued track, the queue gets lost for some reason and it plays a different song?!",4
"Spotify has gotten extremely buggy in the last year or so. I will sometimes get redirected to a playlist radio when I try to shuffle play a playlist, and once in a while it pauses what I'm listening to and the now playing bar in the app and the control widget on my notification screen disappear. I've been a premium member for years and hope these problems get fixed soon, but it looks like they've been known issues for a while.",3
Way too many ads at this point I listen to more ads than music,1
Nice app for music i can enjoy listening cuz most of the songs are available. But it will be great if lyrics were romanized cuz its difficult to sing along as an international kpop stan,4
Nice app all music,5
"The app keeps crashing, songs disappear, had to make new accounts cause it wouldn't let me sign in even if I changed the password and now it just won't open. I'm done, peace out!",1
Great music collection,5
"Extremely infuriating, I pay for Premium and Spotify wont even let me play the songs in MY playlist without playing a random ""recommended"" one, and there is no solution for this, and if there is they have done an incredible job of making the UI as confusing, cluttered and unnavigatable as possible. Unsubscribed, am now using a competitor, which is a lot better, for free.",1
"Really good, only problem is the advising it does if u don't have Spotify premium, other than that a 5/5",5
"Overall, Spotify is a great app. But, as someone who has trouble falling asleep and likes to meditate, it would be great if the sleep timer could be set for more than an hour. - Suggesting a 2 and 3 hour option to be included.",4
"App is not working, it won't load... It only shows the Spotify symbol and it won't do nothing",1
Excellent selection of music and user friendly,5
"I really like Spotify,Much better than other music apps.",5
No obvious way to close the app. It seems to want to run in the background all the time. Not sure why I would want that feature? Uninstalled.,1
App stopped working on Pixel 6 with latest update. Force closes instantly.,1
"It's been a month of waiting, I'm still looking at my screen a logo of Spotify how nice isn't.",1
What happened? Since July 4th the app won't work on my phone. It keeps stopping or shutting off completely and it won't play in the background. I used this app for sleeping and can't. There is also no way to skip or relisten to anything. Please fix! We pay premium and don't want to find another app for music and podcasts.,1
We can pick make our fave playlist,5
My play/pause options have disappeared. This is very annoying! Plus the app starts playing on my phone when I turn the car off. Which I can't stop because I don't have the control bar. Loved the app before this happened.,3
"Fix the shuffle ""always on issue"" I'm a paid member and doesn't even give me an option to unselect shuffle anymore. Frustrating doesn't even describe it.",1
I can't open the app it only displays the logo. I tried clearing the data and cache but still doesn't work.,1
"It's extremely annoying that I need an internet connection to view my ""downloaded"" content. That tells me that it isn't truly downloaded. In addition, the app will suddenly show that nothing is downloaded, and content is simply listed in my ""episodes."" Later, even though I haven't done anything and wasn't near wifi, it will show my content as ""downloaded"" again. Shouldn't the app actually download my selections to my phone?",2
"It's good that you can use it for free and listen to playlists, also podcasts that you're into. The two issues I have are that sometimes (most times), I can't listen to the podcasts I've downloaded offline. Then the other is that you can't start a playlist from the beginning, a lot of the time you have to continue the playlist. I used to start another playlist then back again to start it from top but that has not worked in a while.",3
Makes me fall in love with music again!,5
The play bar usually disapear even though I uninstalled and installed the app several times!! Please fix this.,1
I really love to hear music on spotify 😘😘,5
"After this last update, my app keeps opening and crashing. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but to no avail did that work. Such a shame because this would have been a 4 star review. I hope they fix this issue soon",1
Great app to listening to all kinds of music without having to use YT and kill bandwidth,5
"I used to really love this app, so I ended up going Premium. However, for a few months now there has been countless problems. Music or podcasts constantly pausing, the bar where you can skip or pause constantly disappearing. I've contacted Spotify and done everything they've asked, but nothing works. I think they need to admit there is a problem with the app that needs fixing.",2
I've been using Spotify for quite some time already. And in general it's cool. But recently I started experience problems with playing songs and podcasts in offline mode. And in general I have an impression that app became more laggy. Hope this is temporary.,4
I always find the music that I'm looking for.,5
Best music streaming app for free,5
It's nice I can listen to my music,5
Bangla & Hindi songs collection is so poor! Increase more songs.... 🎧,1
shuffle doesn't work,4
#1 music 🎸and podcast🎙️ application 💥 for when you get the need 👙 for some time out.💡,5
"SECURITY ISSUE. The accounta are not secure, avoid signing in with your email service if you cannot avoid using the app. Have been using it for almost a year to discover this. Your login information is NOT secure. Apart from that.. App is not upto the standard. Bells and whistles but no quality. Low quality customer support for a paid service. The audio is very low quality, also the support executives have zero clue about their own product.",1
It's got all the song that I like,5
Its real easy to hear a favourite song i like it,5
Good until the time i paid for the mini plan on Sunday but nothing happened 🙄,4
Best music app I really enjoy it when I'm depressed or happy .😅 Anything anytime just spotify ❣️ Music is the medicine for everything 💕💞,5
"bit disappointed. used to work great, but once I logged out wouldn't let me back in",3
"Your servers always have a problem with logging me in. So frustrated, whenever I get a new phone, it's so hard to log in again",4
"i accidentally pressed log out and now It's stuck at the logo screen. I've uninstalled and intalled it numerous times, cleared the data and cache and yet i still can't totally access the app. please fix this i can't lose my playlists there :(",1
"What is this I open the app but the app not start I try all time i check my mobile network, then I use wifi network then I reboot my phone, but the app not start. If the app not work I uninstall the app and i say all don't download the app.",1
So I have the family pack which allows up to 6 devices and when I go to download my play list it says to many devices ( we only use 4) so I log everyone out and still same problem fix it Now or loose a long time subscriber,1
"Has lyrics, integrates better with Chromecast than the Google music service - seamlessly changing from computer to phone to tv, even automatically when I put my earbuds in. I am amazed how well this works. 11/10, it's the little things that matter and it's clear the people making this care",5
"App won't go to log in screen, just shows splash screen",1
Gave it 3 stars coz it says listen to no add songs for 30 mins and after every song it is showing me an add please correct it or should i find another app ?😑😑😡 I heard about karaoke mode when is it gonna come hmm??,2
"Break comes again and again, the mind is bad, that's why I am deleting this app, bad app is bad",1
"it won't let me past the opening screen with the logo I tried re Installing, clear data/cache, force stop , restarting device nothing seems to work plus I don't get canvas feature so I'm gonna cancel premium",1
"Love this app been premium for like 2-3 years, but now i can't go into home (like first page when u enter) and would be cool if that is fixed",4
"Now it stops when you open another app. Music keep randomly stopping this is on a playlist I have downloaded, also app keeps crashing AGAIN. I cancelled my premium because of the problems before. I can't see me keeping it as not much has changed, always problems",1
"Usually love this app and works fine on my phone but on my laptop its a mess. It closes down within seconds of opening it, and doesn't want to work. Sadly its only the spotify desktop app which is giving me problems, i hope they check if there are some bugs soon :) other than that love the app",3
"I dont listen to music alot but spotify is pretty solid, but im still waiting for that one karaoke feature i saw on tiktok i dont know if thats real or not but ive already updated my spotify so yeah",5
Latest update is rubbish. The app is not even working atm. First on my car ay. Now not on Android phone at all. Trying to reinstall the app. Get you stuff together I pay for a working app. Not this,1
"Constamtly randomly pauses, or doesn't let you press play at all. Terrible for a paid for service",1
Worst app I ever seen too much problems. My recommendation please do not download this app..,1
First of all I had to make a new account because it wasn't giving the option for mobile login. Then now when I play a song on shuffle or normally after every skip it reaches the first song I played and it's frustrating seriously,1
The best music app that I have used so far,5
"Pls fix the bug i can't open Spotify since yesterday 07/4/2022, pls i can't open Spotify not gonna lie i can't pls help me or fix it, thank you.",1
Sound is. So clear. Easy to use.,4
"So far so good, I am loving the app. It makes collecting my Playlists easy",5
"Finally Spotify have put in lyrics if available, such a long time.",4
Good UI but too much ads. Mostly cringe ads.,4
Had all my music saved to my sd card yet when Spotify updated I lost everything and it won't let me go back to sd card as it keeps trying to download to the phone. There is no problem with my sd card so I blame Spotify for stressing me out unable to use app now offline,1
"Very easy to use, thanks 😊",5
The song which I want to listen is not played.For example I want to play lut gaye from Jubin Nautiyal.Other song is played but not lut gaye.Very sad.,1
Amazing i would say I'm not premium member but I didn't give it full 5 star because sometimes the ads are quite often to the point that there would ads after every song and other is that sometimes it just stops working it doesn't show me which song I'm playing so they fixed that i would rate it 5 star without being a premium member,4
For those who are tired of the ads provide by Spotify. Just simply download Spotify from happy mod it's 100% safe and secure and it's exactly the same as the original version you will never get ads and you can also download your favourite songs 👊[thank me later ☺️],1
"New update sucks, I hate the add to queue option when I press on a song. Just play the darn thing",1
"So many problems with player, randomly stops, often doesn't show player etc",3
Great music listening experience. Would love an option to identify a song playing in the background.,4
I hate it because when I play a song I couldn't hear anything and if I download a song it keeps kicking me out of the app,1
It's a really nice app. Has almost all the songs which one could ever dream of. The only problem is too many ads. If maybe u could somehow reduce the amounts of ads for free listeners then that'll be great.👍,4
Option of being able to just hide specific recommendation is just gone?!,2
"App stuck on load screen, even after multiple uninstalls.",1
"Extremely good quality music which gives justice to every music, whether it be jazz, rock, pop, classic etc and also DJ mixes. Very good correspondence",5
Love spotify cause I'm able to make my music list and share it with my friends,5
Too much of ads👎,3
Welcome to the ad app,1
"It keeps randomly pausing podcasts, it's not allowing me to play a searched song, and pause/pause button often dissappears which means I have to close app and start again. And all this using the paid version.",2
Too much Ads,3
If there is power cut and when light comes and you try to play some music it say no network connection,2
It's Good App Cx it has no adds and we can make our own playlists as well it's pretty fun,4
Well organised app but reason for 2 stars are 1.) Lots of ads after every 2 songs there's an ad 2.) Connected to wifi with avg speed of 10mbps still there's a network error so I have to close app and open again 2-3 times to try my luck,2
For real bro... 6 skips an hour. Were putting limits on skips now how money hungry can you get,1
Very nice to listen to music,5
Horrible when you click on a song it doesn't play that song it plays a playlist and too make matter worse you can't even play specific songs on a playlist you created,1
"Stupid app, borderline greedy. Forces use to use premium, or else you almost couldn't even listen to your album. Why the auto shuffle? No one needed that thing",1
"I listen to it when i going to sleep, when im exersizin, and even when im playing games with myself.",5
"can't really complain , except that sometimes it just stops playing music... this is honestly very irritating , i'm assuming it does this , because i don't a subscription but all in all , i highly recommend it , good quality music edit : I canceled my subscription 2 months ago because I couldn't deal with the double deductions every month. They still deduct money from my account and they are refusing to refund me my money. If you know what's good for you, you will download Apple Music.",1
It's a good app but the ads are just annoying and I don't know why we get 6 skips per hour like why not just remove the feature and sometimes I'll be in a sad mood and then an ad will come on and will ruin the vibe And and then another add will come on but look it's a very good app but just lower the ads and remove the 6 skips per hour thing please?!?!,1
"Since the new update, the ""now playing"" tab keeps disappearing and I can't even pause or click next track. After a while, the track stops. I have tried uninstall and install it again, but it keeps happening. Pls fix the bug, it's annoying.",2
"The experience could be improved for offline mode. If I start playing a playlist that I downloaded already online, I'm unable to just continue playing it if I go offline. I must replay it from scratch, which is a problem if I was playing in shuffle mode. Please improve on that. Also, if a Spotify playlist is updated by just reshuffling tracks, songs don't need to be downloaded again if they've already been downloaded. Please find a way to just rearrange without downloading again.",4
It helps me calm down and helps me play games longer,5
Great sound tracks.,5
It is has amazing options. But it always have problems with loading. It always shows (no internet connection available). While all other apps work absolutely fine in my current network connection.,3
"Spotify is really no. 1 music app because I found it everywhere like Windows, MacBook, WebOS TV, Android and many more. I really loved it ♥️ And quality is also 1st class",5
Can listen to all my play lists and more,5
"Listen,Spotify is a great app, I've been using it for over 3 years,the people on here say 'it plays random songs not from my playlist' usually that is with a normal subscribtion. I highly recommend getting premium,if I'm not mistaken a family package is around R99pm.It is amazing and I really enjoy Spotify and their music!",5
Lately the app doeasn't show itself and I can't control it like pause or play or close it. Sometimes I restart the phone itself!,2
Everything great other than the equalizer menu should be accessible on the homepage snd the app has some bad optimization or something because it opens super slow.,4
A dreamy app to experience your life with more beats & melodies whenever you want... Just adds are intruption and remindes me how poor I am.... 😅,4
I don't like how it's not working how it use to but it's an AMAZING app it's just I want to listen to a different song when a song is playing but it plays 10 seconds of the song I want to listen to,4
Just keep stopping for no reason. Have to force close to get it working again. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️,2
"Too many adds and more emphasis on buying premium , podcast Don't have adds soo good",4
This app best from all music apps excellent app forever,5
Queue related things have been bugging for many months. Songs randomly skipping and queue sometimes just wiping itself. Adding songs sometimes deletes other songs from queue. Really annoying as queuing is one of core functions.,2
"Back then, this app was good and smooth. I've noticed some upsetting developments in the last several days. When I start opening my Spotify app, all I have seen is the logo. It's crashing and freezing at the same time. I've still thought of trying those Tutorials on youtube, but many of them didn't work. So I'm expecting that this concern of mine will be fixed immediately.",2
Amazing I took of my phone expecting to come off like other apps but it did not I'm impressed if u love playing games while listening to music like me I really say download this app truely amazing,5
"Not too long of ads, can play psn and listen to music come from my headset.",5
I absolutely love spotify. I can play any music I want for free,5
Tracks are well organized.,5
Good variety of artists and playlists. User-friendly.,4
It takes forever to load know and ive never had a problem woth it til 2 days ago. I have to exit out of the app and go back in multiple times before it will fully work...,2
"I love being able to listen to my music, but lately I'll pick one of my playlists and it gets stuck on a black screen with the spinning green circle. Is this a glitch? I really want to listen to my music.",3
"Spotify helps me reach out to ebooks, podcasts and all interesting stuff all at once.",1
"My Spotify keeps crashing, please work on it.",1
"I have a Samsung A20 that recently had a software update and since then the app is completely unusable. My entire library is gone and I have no history so release radar and discover weekly along with other personal playlists are completely gone. I've uninstalled and reinstalled to app several times. I tried going offline o n both mobile and desktop and reconnecting hoping they sync. Logged in and out over and over. I'm annoyed to say the least. UI is version 3.1, android version 11.",2
Pairs with the truck before start 🌄 drives.,5
This app is not open I install 3 times,1
"Spotify is the best music app out there!!! Yawl better get with the program people. Get Spotify now and try it for yourself, You'll love it too!!!! Spotify, the app to get!!!",5
Keeps telling me to check my internet connection. Can't play anything,2
This apps is not Good I cant disconnect to monthly subscription 😡,1
It's an awesome app. Really like & enjoy it,5
"Getting worse by every update so laggy and even tho i have premium i cant listen music when i dont connected to internet, my whole library wont update and be useable without internet even when i opened offline mode",1
8/10 I don't mind ads but certain ads are annoying,5
The waste app I have seen .30 min per 1 add they will say but 2 songs per one add . The waste and lie app I have seen .,1
"Overall, the app is really good. Knocking a star for the regular harassment to upgrade to a family account from the dual. Enough already!",4
Love it #1 in my book. Been a customer for over 4 years,5
"The last update broke the app, it stops playing randomly, doesn't show anything currently playing when there is something playing (no bar down the bottom or on the phone's notification Panel). Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but to no change.",1
If only all the songs I downloaded could appear on a single page,4
So much add . and i don't have any interst of premium . please stop,4
"Best app for music and new discoveries. The a.i. recommendations to similar artists/albums, is second to none, a must though is membership. But worth every penny if you are a fellow music fan. Would give 100 stars if I could; spotify has re-ignited my passion in listening to good, new (and old) music.",5
It offers good quality and you can also find incredible play lists in this.,5
"Used to be my favorite music apps but after log out, i can't open the apps in my phone",1
App constantly crashes and is very buggy,2
When in stress I always switch to Spotify which is a magical magical music app which makes feel more comfortable,5
Best music app out there.,5
I love lessening to Spotify It plays the music that l love ❤️,5
Beautiful sync between computer and mobile,5
Great app with all the music I love!!,5
Can't use the search option anymore. Keeps on saying 'No internet connection' while my internet works just fine. It's getting impossible to use Spotify with all these bugs. Please fix it.,1
"I loved the app and listening to music for a while, but now the mobile app wont even fully load. Whenever I try to open to app, It stays on the icon screen forever. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing data, clearing cache, restarting my phone, restarting my networks, but nothing is working for me.",3
I am happy by listening songs with spotify,5
"The apps keeps crashing anytime I try to make a Playlist, and even then I can't listen to a single song or podcast because ""my internet connection is not responding"" or something, it says as I play YouTube videos just fine. Even created Playlist appear to be empty. Every. Single. One. If I try to make a Playlist and it doesn't crash for some damn miracle as much as I add songs the Playlist it stays empty... and I really wanted to use this app, fix it or lose my money.",1
"AVOID THIS APP!!! you are better off listening to song on YouTube. I uninstalled it 2 hours after I installed it. You can search for a song but when you try to play it Spotify decides you really should listen to another. I searched for Should Have Been a Cowboy, song not album. I hit the play button and what comes out of my phone? Bubby Shot the Jukebox. Ok, I must have done something wrong so I do it again. I never did get this steaming pile of fecal matter to play it get correct song.",1
"Can't even start the app, I have to use spotify lite",1
It worked and now it doesn't at all I pay spotify premium just for it not to work,1
There are the songs which you can't even find in YouTube...One of the best music listening app ever,5
"Toooooo many ads....its irritating.an ad between 2 songs...worst uh.. Other than ads u can find all the songs, playlists... I'm gonna uninstall it due to ads 😒",1
"I love this app so much to be honest, tho paying 10$ for premium is a bit much and when i turn off my phone to listen to it same will the music sometimes but all and all i love this app so much its really great! :)",4
spotify is the best app to listen to music!! 🤩🤩 but sometimes i'm always indecisive on the song i should listen to 😹😹,5
"For me, at one point it would just not load. For example, the Spotify symbol would just stay on the screen frozen, not doing anything until I just gave up on it.",3
Alot of ads,4
This app used to be great but in like the past year it's gotten to where it doesn't load. Even songs that are downloaded won't load if you don't have internet connection. I don't understand why I'm paying such a high fee n can't have my music and podcast,2
"Been running into a bunch of bugs recently. The most annoying is that I can't add more than one thing to the queue. If I keep adding, it will just erase the previous addition and I have to restart my phone several times to get it to work. Every now and then the control bar will disappear so I can't pause whatever I'm listening to even if I try from my headphones. Not to mention the random freezing and shutting down that has been more frequent lately. I've reported it before, never heard back",2
I like the feature that has lyrics but it'd be nice to have the option available to cast the lyrics to the same device I'm listening on.,5
I love the songs it has diffrent langigesit. Its... Perslfect,5
The User Experience and UI of the mobile app is awful. Lots of missing features and functions such as sorting playlists are just hidden behind menu's and menu's and it's a very bad experience when compared to the desktop version.,2
"not sure what happened but for 2 days now, my mobile spotify app hasn't been working. it's showing my playlists on the home page, but not in my library. whenever i click on a playlist, it shows zero songs, so i can't play music on my phone at all. fix this please!!!!",1
App gets stuck on the logo screen,1
You can find all your music favorites....And still doing it Thanks,5
"I really enjoy this app and kindly i be searching songs, that i have never listened for a long long time❤ thanks to this app niether it depletes to much data cost, but thanks😍🤙🏻",5
Easy Interface....Personalised playlists...superb sound quality.,5
I think it's a good way to wake up listening to something instead of a clock going off every morning. And it helps connect with family and friends also helps u get in a good mood or if u wanna sing with someone this is the number one app I recommend.,4
The app it's self isn't that bad great selection of music but the algorithm for Shuffle is horrible.,3
"It's an absolutely great app for listening to music, but only if you have time. This app is unreal if you don't have to wait for music, but if you have low service and a want to play your already downloaded music you're SOL, you're going to have to wait for service to play the music downloaded on your phone. This also applys if you're a service member without service overseas. You wont have access to your already downloaded to your phone music at all.",3
Years in and I still love it. Never a problem. So much easier than ANY other app. Love my music and they deliver. Thank you..,5
Plays music but adds are quite annoying. How.many times does it need to tell you to use tide pods because they have less water than liquid detergents. Stupid adds between the songs. Uninstalled after three weeks.,2
They just removed a latest marathi film songs album which I was frequently listening these days. The claim of 30 min music without ads after a long ad is not right.,3
5 stars Spotify Your the Goat for fixing it lots of love. Never gonna stop using Spotify my goto music sorce!!! 100/100,5
Good apps i wanna give 5 star but using this app longer and longer the ads come every 2 song after and says 30 min uninterrupted ads but when we play 3 song or more ads come again. Some song are unable to play. Last point when entering playlist it took time but when we turn off our net and enter the playlist it's fast... Wts does it mean?? Plzz fixed it,2
"Rarely have I looked for anything - rare, live, obscure...- that I can't find.",5
Very greatful app for song.. And also i request to you please add one feature also to identify any songs.. Especially it is very helpful to identity edited ringtone amd songs... Because i think some people's are knowing nice music and songs through the 1 minute or 30 second edited status video from the whatsapp.. Instagram etc... I hope you try to add a feature to identity musics&songs .. Really iam still enjoying your apps,5
I cant open this years wrapped before the app crashing two seconds into the first slide. Please fix this,4
"It's a good app for music, but there's a lot of ads and you can't skip more than six songs.",3
There appears to be more and more bugs happening every day. It's a shame the overall rating doesn't fully capture the current experience using the mobile app. Every issue I'm experiencing I can find in other users ratings.,2
"I really love it bcz i love songs to and listening a story horror story, funny story, sad story, romantic story, that u can listen in Spotify you can listen any songs and story and u will enjoy it i promise",5
"Since my spotify got premium, my spotify was like possessed by a demon, it changed the song by itself, turns up the volume by itself, and annoys me by opening other pop up screens when I am typing, just like a cellphone screen that gets hit by water. It is not worth it at all.",1
This is a excellent music app to listen to.,5
Ever time I played a song it would ether play a song that won't stop playing unless I restart my phone or it would pause at random times!,1
"The moment I paid for premium, the app ain't starting and getting hanged. Wasn't expecting this action from Spotify.",1
"The app doesn't load in my phone, but liter version of it does and any other music player",1
In the beginning Spotify was good but now it is the worst I can't skip music when I search for a song it gives me a playlist wih the same name and it doesn't even contain the song I want and songs are not full when I play a song it gives a very very short part of it uh And honestly sound cloud ☁️ is better 😌,1
No replay option!! You can only listen to music once!! Cheap app,1
WHY THE HELL DOES THIS NEW UPDATE KEEP MAKING MY MUSIC PAUSE LIKE EVERY 20 SECONDS. ITS VERY ANNOYING!! I DO NOT PAY PREMIUM EVERY MONTH FOR THIS. PLEASE FIX BUG!!,4
"I stopped subscribing because you had podcaster that ia an anti vaxxer spreading disinformation. If he is gone , I will come back.",1
It's a pretty good app but i hate the update.,1
Definitely the best. Recommended for many more music lovers.,5
"Love this app. Whatever mood I am in, Spotify can satisfy my music craving. I just wish I knew how to stop my notifications from interrupting my songs.",5
"Love this app, I only use this for my music streaming. I pay for premium for my family and both my mom and I have been experiencing weird pauses and skips. For example, sometimes when I let my phone screen time out while playing music and it goes dark it pauses, sometimes it will come back on its own and other times I have to restart the app. It pauses other times too. It's a minor inconvenience but very annoying.",3
Loving Spotify since 2015,5
"You're always updating. Stop. Get it to where it works and don't touch it. Every time you guys update the are problems... or maybe, I don't know, DO IT RIGHT. App is stopping again for no reason. And no, I don't want to uninstall and download all my music again.",1
The volume of music when using earphones is low but when the ads pop it will blow my ears and it has 2-3 ads in a row what waste of time I could just open my youtube app.,1
This app doesn't let your critique anything; whether it be like racist or single minded podcasts like behind the bastards or necronomipod. I find it quite humorous that such a large business could be so reckless when so many of their podcast creators destroy lives without little to any evidence.,1
"I can still access my playlists and play songs on the web browser, but through the mobile app, i cannot",1
"Honestly love the app for release radar and unlimited music but I'm getting so frustrated that, for so long, random issues constantly arise. Adding a song to the queue replaces any songs in the queue, I'll have a queue and a new song I click will delete the queue, I'll click a new song and the queue will go to the next song instead of the song I just clicked, and out of nowhere after an hour or so spotify will just stop. I'm sorry, but if I'm paying, it's been months please fix these issues!",4
"Love Spotify so much, only reason it doesn't have five stars is because there are so many ads. But, great quality and I love how I can find any song on here!!! <3",4
It works perfectly fine before but starting yesterday it won't get pass the spotify logo sign for minutes then it would freeze and exit on its own. I'm missing my playlists already so please fix it!,3
Usually I use use spotify daily but recently there's been a glitch and it just shows the logo when I open it and it doesn't work. I've tried doing things to my device to try and help it but nothings working.,1
I enjoy a mix of music with limited adds,5
"For some reason still no access to lyrics unless I make a new account, which makes zero sense...",5
Great app. Sometimes glitches and the controls don't work so I have to keep listening without skipping songs. Normally good though.,4
"The new update sucks a fat one!! Pauses randomly, the player disappears and I can't pause/stop the music. Edit: after a couple of months, updates, re-installs, these issues are still happening. Very disappinting considering I have a pretty new high-powered Samsung galaxy.",3
"Jesus this is frustrating. Even though I force close this app several times, it immediately opens in my car and I can't get it to not connect. It is ridiculously frustrating. Borderline useless. I hope the engineers that worked on this get diarrhea and a cough for a week.",1
I like it but the new update is trash and is makes me want to get rid of it please fix it,1
"I mean I used to love spotify but now it literally plays an ad after every song. Not only this but it constantly exits the app and stops playing a song for no reason. It also skips songs on its own. It also plays those ads that supposedly gives you 30mins of ad free music if I watch it and when I do watch it, it starts playing ad after ad and it's annoying. I get you need to pay artists but the amount of ads played is ridiculous. Had to move to Apple music, can't use spotify no more.",2
"Come on, its spotify, its the best music app out there",5
Excellent listening experience. You can listen to music with the screen off.,5
Like the plaY lists they set up for me based on the music I like.,5
It's too good. All the songs I can ask for are available at one platform. I am loving it.,5
Easy to use easy to enjoy with my devices!,5
it's good but im begging yall to show what playlists a song are in. like for example after you click 'add to playlist' maybe have a mark next to the playlist name if the song is already in the playlist. it would make organizing so much easier and less time consuming please add it 😭😭,4
It's pretty good one day I'll pay the fee but not today lol,4
"Spotify suddenly logged out my acc out of nowhere and they wouldn't let me log in. It always says, ""SOMETHING WENT WRONG, TRY TO USE YOUR EMIAL INSTEAD"" but whenever I try to use my email, it always says ""THERE'S NO USER FOUND IN THIS EMAIL"" It's frustrating!!!! I just want my acc back???!?!?!???",1
It's a good app but when I tried to play my own playlist I made it just starts playing random songs that I don't even like Spotify if you can make it an option to make it were the only songs in there are the ones we pick and not some random songs,1
Spotify is one of the best choices for music that I can think of. I had premium for a year and that was really great cause I was able to make-up some fantastic playlists. And they don't erase them when you go back to free.,5
Love it lots of great music choices,5
I'm not able to open Spotify,1
Definitely a great music an podcast app. Easy to navigate thru the app.,5
I absolutely love Spotify!!!,5
I hate how it adds more songs to a single song and you just wanted to listen to that one song and it adds songs to your playlists too.Also why can't you remove songs?,1
"Love this app. Wish I could work for Spotify, bet it's a real blast. 😜 The only issue I have is the ads. Can't afford to go premium just yet !",5
I love that I can see all my favorites and much more,4
Bro when I connect my Alex to my phone click on a song it just doesn't play that song even when I am not connected to my Alex very bad aap,1
Used to be Great but now is not. When apps misfunctions one must delete all content to reset. No customer support exists-- just advice from other users. So to get the value of my Premium Subscription I must uninstall to re-install dumping my 1k song library 😞😓😩 07/22 no change. Review remains valid,2
Please if you would provide us with a video player It would be fantastic,5
Great music love this app,5
"5 stars, for the most of the times. Car mode could improve. Some songs are not there, but all in all... It rocks 😊",5
Need to add option to redeem spotify card from app itself .currently I only see a credit card and paypal options .guess you guys dont seems to care .please add that option to the app or me personally I'm done .it shouldn't be hard to add that option to the app.,1
Constantly crashes on my pixel 6. Has so many bugs where it plays music but I can't pause or stop it.,1
"I love this app, it gives the listener a high quality of sound and it has great catalogue of music which caters for everyone's tastes. The plus with Spotify Pro you get the added bonus of no ads and get to download whatever song or album you like. Spotify also grows with you, it keeps track of all your music likes and Spotify gives you a more tailor-made experience. 10/10 ' love it.'",5
"Great music app, however some great songs are unavailable. I know this may be out of the companies control but it does suck whenever I want to listen to a song only to find it is unavailable.",4
Now ads bad app,1
Why doesn't it want to show the songs,5
Great can use a little work,5
Nothing else needs to be said... Finding artist I am looking for!,5
Great music selection easy interaction with app. Overall amazing expetience and premium with no ads...just great!,5
Often times its deleting my dowloaded music even if im premium,4
"Lot of bugs, One of them is when you remove (-) a song and press next(>) in playlist--- It skips next two songs and plays",3
Very good app but I know they want to have money but it is somewhat frustrating to wait 1 hour just to change the song if you have changed it 6 times besides you can't choose because you have to be premium for Not having to listen to other songs and only listen to the one you want,3
"It's an Amazing app it's the only music app I use other than youtube. The only thing is sometimes the ad that gives you 30 mins uninterrupted listening bugs, But it's no big deal",5
Has anybody experienced the Mike Rowe's podcast freezing and not playing at all?.,5
Reliable and loaded with the music I like,5
"Excellent choices and variety, a go to for any music enthusiasts",5
"Even without premium I can still enjoy my music, it's a very very nice and enjoyable app.",5
"I really love Spotify, but I recently moved to Apple music because of payment issues. I wish you guys will support Google pay for payments.",3
"I still have Spotify, and the songs are great, but the reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because there wasn't very many ads before, and now there are SEVERAL. I get the same ads over and over and over. I'm sick of it! AND NOW Spotify had decided to give me THE EXACT SAME AD TWICE IN A ROW. Like, seriously?! I don't want Premium. I'm not paying $15.00 for that bullsh*t. Fix. This. NOW. I'm literally currently trying to find a different app to listen to music on, but so far nothing good. FIX IT! 😠",2
Wonderful music...all my favorites that I haven't heard in years,5
"Everytime I save my music to the SD card, the app decides to reset the default storage to local storage. This has happened 3 times now. I hate having to redownload everything again. It's heavily inconvenient. Fix this please. Otherwise it's a great app",3
"Very comprehensive catalogue of music. The one thing that would improve the experience would be the ability to ""insert"" songs into playlists at a specific point rather than having to delete/remove songs and start again.",5
No CD quality yet!,2
Brilliant in every way. 11/10,5
"Gapless playback doesn't work between end and beginning of albums, it ruins the experience of certain albums, especially Nonagon Infinity which is meant to infinity loop. Otherwise it's perfect. Also really good for learning lyrics to songs.",4
"Spotify is currently useless, I can't pay for premium anymore. Its like they don't want my money anymore",1
This app is ok but there is some issues about it.(1) if I was having my music on shuffle it would start playing random country songs that is not even on my playlist. (2) i cant even play my songs in order the way I want if I do then I would only give like 15 seconds of listening the song so it have to be on shuffle. (3) it sucks.,2
"Great music on Spotify,would recommend.",5
I think it sucks we have to pay for no ads but other than that I love it :),4
Spotify is a very good music app Just one thing about it if you have a Google Display it won't let you play all the Music you have to actually go on the app to hear the song I hate this I don't know if it is because of Google or Spotify and I don't know if this happens on Alexa but besides that it's a good music app for you to get,4
"this app used to be good,but now you have to buy some random thing to listen to the song you want to listen to,,please change it back to be free",1
"Found out a lot of new music & artists over years thanks to the ""Radio"" feature. Very nice algorithm, even though my taste is very wide (: One thing Spotify should improve (that bothers me daily & would also be very easy to perform in my opinion) - Enable ticking boxes so that we'd be able to add songs to multiple playlists at once, without the drag of having to press the ""more"" (3 dots) option over and over again!",4
Look they asked nicely and I decided to rate it 5 stars it's really good,5
In the 70's you had to flip the LP after every 5 songs! Then 80's CD's were... eject and insert the next CD. We've come along way baby!,5
Good Quality Sound best online ..but thank you Spotify by free share with friend....,5
I love Spotify I get all the music I enjoy and even more I may have forgotten about in one place.,5
The app logged me out for no reason then deleted all of my downloads after sending me a forgot password link that never worked and when I did get in it logged me out immediately when I went out of the app. I had Wi-Fi the whole time as well,4
"I used to love this app, I was happy with the certain skips a hour but now three adverts before one song and worst part is, it is not even music from my playlist being played. I have certain playlists for each activity I'm doing or who ever is using my account and I don't like how when listening to my playlist, songs that aren't added start playing.",2
Absolutely ultimate music customized just for you. 15 year member,5
Don't ask me I reaubscibed and now the plan I originally had I didn't pick this individual plan I had the share plan and all the music saved is no longer and also save nothing created 3 playlists sat the past 30 mins adding music not one song saved ? What's the deal,3
Please enable the capability of clicking on music labels within the credits.,3
"Pls help me :( I installed app but it doesn't work, actually it stuck on the first page ( the first page which includes the green circle)",1
Good music and i love this app,5
"UPDATE: Loads slower than molasses lately! 🙄 Spotify is my ""GoTo"" music app!!!! I don't pay for the premium, I know! I do, however, feel leary about some of the security of the app and how it seems to have different music for 'suggestions' that are NOT relevant to me in anyway?? Sometimes, it even shows I've listened/watched things I haven't! With that being said, customer support could step up their game a smidge if possible for attending to inquires when emailed! Overall, 💕it!",4
Best Music Streaming App On Play store,5
Great app got all my favorite songs love the premium not happy about the price going up but whatever.,4
Best choice of music.,5
It was great but now on this new phone the app doesn't pop-up on the lock screen or the notification panel it doesn't show a preview of the current song,2
I love Spotify but sometimes annoying when I can't find a song I like lol. Hardly ever happens,4
"Device limit reach reached. Unable to download songs, no option to remove other devices, zero transparency on device count, 'sign out everywhere' does nothing and I have reached out to support. Spotify is awesome but this sucks. Show me my devices or let me remove them. Don't count old devices that have been offline for a year or more. Spotify apparently wants to burn money having this handled by their tech support department instead of providing an easy method for end-users.",1
"Love it,opens so many doors WOW!!",5
Because of so much ads,1
Free awesome at least with ads it is free,5
"Awesome, thank you so much for the service.",5
The only music streaming app i use. 5/5,5
"I love this app! Great selection, great variety and very few advertisements. WOW I just can't say enough good things without being corny! !;-)",5
"Probably the best music streaming app I ever used till now. It has so many features like - 1. You can make blends with your friends. Spotify can create a blend for 10 people ( that's a lot ) 2. To be honest, the ads are never too much, unlike some other apps where you get an ad after every 1 song. 3. It can play music in the background. 4. It also automatically starts a song if the song which you chose to play is done playing. Conclusion : I highly recommend this app",5
The app would not let me play my liked songs instead just random now im mad please help,3
Amazing music app 👌🏻👌🏻💕,5
Probably the best app for music streaming.,4
Overall good app but to many ads,5
In love they make music for all the crazy music I listen to they learned I have a happy mix and depressed mix and more that helps so much.. I totally recommend this app for everyone,5
Some songs aren't available why? And there's a bug where I pause my music and the playback goes from 1:45 to 4:45 or even 0.,3
"It's okay, not great, not terrible, very okay, a bit janky on Android, sometimes stops working when I lock my screen, or just stops playing. Bit dissapointing for a paid service. The general UI experience is also weak, it'd be cool for a free app made by some stoner kids, but not a premium paid-for music service. Also no Raspberry Pi OS (ARM64 support is really REALLY quite lame.)",2
I love this app it is the best app for music in my opinion but I hate how I'm listening to a song it ends and a whole different song pops up not even in my playlist I get it's supposed to get you into new music but it is so annoying I can be listening to my favorite song I cannot wait for this next song I really like here's a song that I've never liked and the artist is not the best otherwise it's pretty good app,3
I use it daily. I don't catch any problems.,5
If you want to listen to it and but it gives you 30 minutes of free listening and it will give you six skips just skip this song per hour and go to use them wisely but again a very good app,5
The worst app I've ever been used . It's had show often same ads and after your mobile network issue the app doesn't support to play a single song.. That's why im1 uninstalling this worst app ...,1
"Has all of my favorite songs!! One thing.... it says ""no internet connection available"" when I try to play a playlist.. even when I do! Anyone else having this issue??",4
The App just isn't playing the music when i cast it to my tv.,3
Very intrusive app that don't respect privacy.,1
I am giving it 4 stars because it has problem that when I play music from my playlists it doesn't played plz look into this issue. And this app is very good for music . And I am deleting this app until issue resolved,4
"How about giving the option to listen to elevator music until the darn app open? Takes more than a minute to load up, really? It is truly the buggies app on my phone!",1
Not good after recent update. I can't see what song is playing and it pauses at every notification I get,2
Does this app just shut itself off when an update is available idk but it's getting annoying that i have to come back every 2minutes to hit play again!,1
This app service Very fast all song avaliable here Good works Spotify 💟💟💟💯💯💯💥💥❣️❣️,5
Updates always break the app stop updating so often,1
Fix the app. It keeps stopping and won't show on the notification bar.,2
Removing the Enhance feature from Like Songs makes exactly zero sense. Wish I could downgrade my version to get the feature again. Instead I have to fiddle by creating redundant playlists from my Liked Songs existing playlist.,3
"More commercials than music, this is no longer a music app...it's an add app! Your own greed will ruin you.",1
"App not working properly after latest update. No panel at bottom of screen to set sleep timer, and will stop playing after 5 minutes. Before this update I would use it every day, but just frustrating now, won't be using until fixed.",1
I like spotify but i hate that i can't just play my entire library without having to add songs to a playlist or like all songs. Can you just create a shuffle button to play all songs in a person's library?,3
I love this app BTS all songs available for Spotify 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜,4
Very awesome app very easy to use,5
I like their music without ads on their premium and I like their choices and my choices and it's enjoyable why I cook because I cook for a living and it's stress relieving and the music really helps,5
"Generally fine. Not always as intuitive as the developers perhaps assume. Also hurry up and make a way to completely disable group sessions. If it's not something you want, the fact that someone in your group can change what you're listening to is very annoying. Especially when they don't even realize that they are doing it. See above for the app not always being as intuitive as developers assume",3
Premium user here and can't use the app. It keeps on crashing the plsy/pause bar dissappears I can't play podcasts for longer than 5 minutes. I can't move around my playlists. This has been going on for weeks now. I want my money back.,1
Can't see the bar to skip 15 seconds etc at the bottom of the app or when the app is closed.,1
THE worst app. first my account automatically Log out and then all my favourite songs are gone. I update this app but still nothing. And I'm also uninstalling this. 😤😤😤😤😤,3
"Just got the s22 ultra, and after opening the app, it just shows the logo and doesn't do anything else. I haven't even logged in to my account",1
"Just few words ""the best""",5
I am getting sick of you guys changing what I am listening to when I press to play my liked playlist and you keep starting to play songs that are not on my liked playlist. I purposely choose to play my liked songs for a reason so stop changing it to play something that is not in my liked playlist. 😡 If I wanted to play random stuff I would say play suggested music but I don't hardly ever do that I just want the music I want to hear which is in my light playlist so stop messing with it. 😡,1
Love that I can pick my own music genre and make my own Playlist.,5
I love being able to close out the app and open other apps and still listen to music,5
"Love it... Always have all the music (artists, albums anything u desire) for any type of mood/situation....",5
After the last update i dont have controls on pausing or seeing whats playing. It just plays and the only way of stopping is to force close the app. Samsung user,2
"The first few days it was a great app where I could listen to music freely, but now I have six skips an hour! And when I go on my playlist it says THEY ADDED STUFF ON MY PLAYLIST! That's my playlist! How are you gonna add songs that I don't even like! The songs that you add are not why I made the playlist! You're just ruining it, I'm going to a diffrent app. This one is just a waste of time, and money for people who use Spotify premium",1
This app is terrible if you want to be able to play your own songs that you own. If you want to radio that you cannot control in any way shape or form it's fine if you want a pod catcher great if you want to be able to actually play your music that you own it gives you a middle finger,1
"This was an extorinary music app. The biggest thing is whatever we like the song we can like and put it easly in playlist. So, I think is the best app to listening music 😍🎶🎶🎵🎵🎶🎶",4
Sometimes it lags,4
Any music or podcasts anytime anywhere!,5
Great app but I have been having issue like when I playy music the app closes it and when I open the app it won't let me even I tried everything also the 6 skips is too low to be honest especially I have to whatch 5 amount of ads which is ridiculous I hope this get fixed,3
Very nice app for music,5
Awesome to hear music for free☺😘,5
its good but I don't like the fact ive to pay to choose what song i can listin too,4
I love it! I wish I have money to get the premium hahaha! But Spotify is the best music app for me!♡,5
Great variety of music.,5
"I LOVE SPOTIFY.. In my opinion Spotify is the BEST music app out there, change my mind. YOU CAN'T!!!",5
It's great I love listening to music on it . It works great except the fact that Spotify automatically stops working after playing two or three songs . Can you help with that?,4
My playlits are all empty but on my ipad they are all there help me plss,1
Very interesting. Easily connect me with my old time music,5
Update.Syncing issue sorted. 5 stars Love this app but gave 3 stars as it hasn't been syncing with my Alexa or Google devices,5
Love it. I use this app every day. If finding radio was easy that would be super.,5
It was working fine for many months but nowadays I am facing frequent crashes.sometimes the app doesn't work at aal.,2
"I love the app. I wish we could edit better without premium, because some people cannot buy that, but it doesn't take away from the oppertunities overall. That is, if you can be patient.",5
Too much advertisements..,3
"What a sad excuse to make me pay for subscription. This app is horrifically hard to use. It's like telling a 2 year old how to do things. You tell the app to play this song, but except it plays something completely different all because ""you didn't pay the subscription.""",1
"Previous issue got fixed, but now it plays a song, but doesn't change interface, so you can pause skip and so on...",2
Very very bad experience it only allows us to hear a particular song repeatedly....only when we have a playlist we could hear our favrt song rather than that it plays the same repeated song and from some particular movie ....it makes me very irritating while hearing the same set of song again again,1
All i can play are playlist,2
"I've noticed they use fake artist names on songs they got off of epidemic sound, not cool, they also have record labels using bots to Inflate artists views...",2
I love the way they go straight into the next song like it's being done by a dj,5
"I have 3 Galaxy devices and it's the same over a of them. Stops playing constantly; probably about 10 times in a podcast. Randomly skips songs after the first 30 seconds. Have to reboot ap just to do it all over! Thought it was maybe my phone, but the ap is the same across all devices of mine and same complaints from my sister. I've had buggy aps, but I can say this is the least stable app that I have ever used.",1
Best apps and good idea for the first time,5
Spotify the service is great for listening to music but their apps both for mobile and desktop are the absolute worst. I'm honestly thinking about switching to a different service just because of how absolutely terrible their apps are. They're always crashing or freezing and I need to keep restarting. Absolute nightmare.,1
Better than YouTube having a great meeting better than YouTube,5
Love the app mostly of the time. Sometimes it glitches and will play songs (just a segment of the song over and . Sometimes it'll have two or three songs playing at the same time and I can't figure out how that's happening but for the most part I really like the app,4
"I Love Spotify🙂 they have every song in the world, love graphics and lyric option",5
App constantly crashes and now playing screen to pause no longer appears. FIX YOUR APP. This still continues despite the app being up to date. It's been months how is this still not fixed,1
Music should be uninterrupted and free,3
Everything is great but till rotation,4
There are too many prblm with the quality of song as of changing quality to very high but still unsatisfied 101% much apk is resso I suggest to continue with resso,1
"Overall the app is pretty nice, but the ads are way too intrusive! Sometimes they show up just as soon as I start the app after a few hours of in activity or even first time in a day. This is not normal and user-friendly. Maybe give me at least a few tracks to listen, and then play your ads, would you? The ads shouldn't be the 1st thing that I see and hear.",3
This app is amazing. I like that they provide us new songs even though we are not premium members except the ads. Ads are not that frustrating. It comes every 30 mins which is very good. At last I would like to recommend this app for everyone👍👍,5
Hi since it is the 4th of July can u give all free users a 1 month premium plan because it is the 4th of July and I think it would be very generous of you guys to do that for the month of July!,5
I love this music and podcast app,5
I enjoy using Spotify but it's extremely difficult to update payment details. I've been trying to do this via the app and web for the last one hour to no avail! Check it out asap.,3
Great job...now we can distribute our misic easy,5
"All of the sudden I don't get sound coming from the left speakers in my car. It only happens when in the car. Is this a Spotify app issue, car or both? I have a 2020 Hyundai Tuscon.",3
"Would have loved to give it 5 star. But their payment system in Bangladesh is kind of a mess. I've tried local debit cards from 2 banks, none of them worked and their support couldn't gave me a solution. Also they should introduce mobile banking/MFS payment like Nagad, bKash, Rocket, Upay etc in Bangladesh. They'll get at least 5 times more subscriptions if they introduce MFS payment in Bangladesh. I will update the rating to 5 star if they do this.",3
Super duper app.. amazing songs even u have gujarati songs and bhajans too ...that ur competative app doesn't have.. thanks,5
"Since last update, podcasts stop literally every 10 minutes and the display screen is gone so you can't skip forward or back, view queue, add to queue. It's currently unusable.",1
"hi my spotify is not working today, i tried everything to reinstall it, clear cache, data, restart my phone, it won't work, it only shows up the logo and not responding please fix it thanku:((",1
"I detest this app. It never works properly, I can't cast to Chromecast devices reliably, it auto plays randomly on other devices. I'm so close to just deleting the app and going with another service.",1
Sometimes Even I'm in online I can't search a song. The app says that I'm not in online 🤷‍♂️,1
Just like how easy it is to use,5
"Sound quality is very good, if iam not using app then show adds no issue, but why r u showing adds to take premium, i will never take premium.",1
"If your looking for reveiws to prove to download this app, download it. But even so, I don't have premium and when I downloaded it, it had 1 ad every 30 minutes (or after I closed it out) but recently, it's been giving me 4 or more ads. It def great with premium tho, my brother has it.",4
"The shuffle playlist has to be improved. It keeps playing almost the same song over and over again regardless of the huge amount of music I listed in the same playlist; ultimately the reason why I get bored with my favorite songs too quickly. I hope u fix this, cuz I need a shuffle option—not selective.",4
Nice app song selection is gud,5
Spotify is the best app ever you should try it It doesn't disappoint,5
Can I subscribe to premium via Google play? Cannot find the options beside Visa and PayPal.,1
"Giving 2 star because- 1. Before the update I could hear my device's local music but now it's disappeared 2. After the update there are too many ads between 2 or 3 songs, it was not there before the update",3
I just noticed that people can listen to songs with no ads for free with a glitch and I'm here paying premium.,1
great music user friendly,5
"Excellent platform for discovering new music, and I've had nothing but good experiences with their support.",5
Very good music app,4
"I have been using this for a few years now, saves time and gets me everything and more of what I'd like to hear. Two thumbs up for this app.",5
EDIT: Changing my review from 5 star to 2 star. There are Tons of fake BOT playlists on Spotify and there is no way to report them. One of my Heavy metal tracks got randomly added to an EDM playlist despite not pitching there. EXTREMELY FISHY. Probably trying to tempt me into purchasing streams after I saw the amount of increase in streams. But it just hurts an Artists credibility. Spotify needs to allow us to report fake playlists. This drama of buying streams needs to end,2
Really great had a good time having a good timereally enjoyed it,5
I can't figure out what email I am logged in under. It will not allow me to cancel my premium subscription. I'm going to cry. Fix your app.,1
"The new background share to story ig it's not beautiful , I want traditional.",1
Awesome app.. u will get any songs from this app which u will like,5
Diverse music selection at your fingertips.,5
One of the best apps for listening to music.,5
I'm loving using Spotify got all the great sounds just wish it could be a bit cheaper a month,4
The app's sound quality was epic. I didn't mind the ads but overall the loading of network and all was the best.,4
"Starts song radio randomly when listening to liked music, like its not necessary to do that, especially when im expecting a song to play next and then some random song comes on",1
I put on Whitney Houston and Spotify made me the best play list I ever heard. I listened to it over and over!!!!,5
"Absolutely amazing app ,never once disappointed me in the last 3 years",5
Great music anything I want to hear it's on,5
When I remove a song from my liked its still there for 8 days,3
"I'm enjoying this app very much! Lots of content and features that I love. 5 stars for all that! However, I can't pause podcast episodes with this new update. Super frustrating!",3
Really good app. But I feel bad for aritists,5
Having a LOT of issues with the app just stopping all if a sudden. This has been since I made a family account.,2
Your app performance has fallen apart in the last few weeks. Regularly it forces me into offline mode now and doesn't have my full downloaded library despite being connected to working wifi. Regularly it fails mid song as well now. Sharing music is also not working across the board now. Previously everything worked and now it doesn't work well.,1
Im very entertaint with the variety Spotify provides! From amazing music to talk shows & up to date back stories....I'm very pleased I love that there is something for everyone to like & I will always be a loyal member.,5
"STOP CHANGING MY LAYOUT. This time, I can't even play the songs. I love Spotify, but I'm almost giving up. These changes of layout are horrible, please stop.",2
Nice music all i want is there,4
Easy app for seniors,5
I love this app. I special open the for the rating because this app is hits your choice. Superb 👍😊😊😊❤️🥰,5
So much better than the previous music apps I've used. Offer more free music and other options that I've always wished for in a music app. Thank you!,5
"It is so accessible when using another app, and I am satisfied while using this app",4
More commercials than songs. Disappointing.,3
I love Spotify I downloaded it when I was twelve years old and I was questioning it at first asking my self if I had a good choice. And now all I basically do is listen to Spotify.,5
"It has so much music, great variety, and I use it all the time. I love Spotify, its awesome!",5
"It says ""no internet connection available"" when connected via wifi (not happening with 4g), which is very annoying because some of the content won't even try to load. However, internet connection is available.",2
No way to turn Spotify off. 😕 Had to uninstall it to get it to stop. Pausing it doesn't shut it off.,1
"Latest update automatically plays music upon opening the app when connected to a Bluetooth device??? EXTREMELY annoying, PLEASE allow an option to disable :(",1
ITS AMAZING I love how i can do whatever I want with my music!! I am speechless! ❤️❤️❤️,5
Brilliant app. I use it all the time. The only thing wrong with it is that for phone users the music is stuck on shuffle if you don't have premium. If you removed this it'd make the app better to use. Otherwise it's a handy thing to have.,4
Good. It just need better sound quality,5
"Enjoy listening to the songs I love. Each time I search for songs to listen to, I find ""new"" songs (oldies, but goodies) to add to my collection. And the ads are short and tolerable.",5
Love the free premium although only temporary,5
All of a sudden it will no longer connects via bluetooth in any car. I have tried other apps as well as phone's and it appears to only be spotify that doesn't play.,1
"The music is perfect, but while I play the music, it stops by itself. I don't know why, but nothing wrong with my Internet connection or my data.",3
"Really great experience. Everyone should try it. Though you need load or wifi still worth it. You can download it offline.. and the most finest thing I've wanted is that they have sleep timer so i don't have to worry about ongoing music playing ❤️ for premium well it's still fine, it's your choice. Thank you!",5
Good selection of music and works with all my devices,5
I like this . Spotify is vary good app 🌝🌝🌝,5
Since i do ay monthly please stop with the offers and adverts. All is good besides.,5
Glad to have good music selecting your own preference..,5
Amazing. Very good music 🎵🎶.,5
Spotify keeps crashing plz fix it otherwise it is a really good app I would recommend it,3
Why i cn Not open my acc in spotify i cnnot log in plss fix this,2
This app is so annoying! Everytime I tell it to play a playlist it just plays different songs I don't want and you can't even turn off the recommended songs thing! Please fix this because this is impossible and annoying to use because it doesnt play your playlists and adds songs to every playlist you make which is annoying! Please fix this!!,1
"Amazing quality, with all my favourite music.",5
Excellent includes lyrics I am hook goodbye iTunes there's a new sheriff in town..,5
The best music app I have used so far..,5
Can't use the song feature. Help me please,3
Its good but right now im experience songs playing even tho no song is playing plus when i installed it again its stuck with the spotify logo please fix this,3
Brill and a pleasure to listen too,5
Satisfying - because good music in good quality relieves moodiness and exudes happiness. So why not Spotify!,5
Brilliant music streaming app. No complaints from me. Awesome way to even discover new music.,5
Spotify has gotten much better than ever before. Great app and easy to use. Unfortunately they Censor quiet a bit of fact based political information like the X22 Report and Jordan Sather. But you can find them elsewhere,3
Just search and get the song or soundtrack. But I would reduce my rating if the adds keep on going. Because there is an add after every 2-3 songs.,3
Best app for music.. periot,5
"Best music app so far. Recommendation system became very smart. 👍 Using premium subscription now, to support them.",5
Don't give tooo much ads,5
I always use this app... I mean I can't do any work without music!! I love this app..,5
Pretty good! But I'd like it better if they had more songs. There are some original songs which I cant find here. Still I use it a lot and love it nonetheless 😌,5
Unusable without premium,1
"Every song I click on to play, it plays something entirely different. Why create a music streaming device that doesn't work? I miss the days of iTunes and iPods 😭",1
"Found it easy to use , great music selection brilliant 👍",5
"I used to love this app a lot... Many amazing songs and everything was so perfect... But now it's just like hell. It is reshuffling my songs by its own, adding songs which I don't even listen. I've searched a song almost 20 times and every time it plays different song... Please fix it immediately",1
Good songs quality,5
Fabulous except for ads😅,5
"I don't like the new update, I was using spotify cause it was legal to listening music without using youtube, but since the newest update, I can't choose songs it was random and I need to listen till the end, I could skip but there was a limit to do that. Please bring back the old spotify",1
"This app was a huge hit and improved a lot. But personally, with each update this game makes me wanna cry. What's even 6 skips per hour? I'm not even gonna talk about the ads... This app just turned out to be a big disappointmen. Honestly at this point it's even better to pay for YouTube music premium",2
"Used to be 5 but now 1 star since recent update. Player stops randomly, doesn't show playing, can't start or stop, no controls need to shut the app constantly. Fixed by delete and redownload but then a few days later back to the same. Utter shite. Please give me the old version back.",1
"Ok, the latest update is just horrible, there is a limitation of the number of skips i can do per hour, and i can only play my playlist with shuffle, now my hardwork of making the order of the songs are just ruined, don't download this, plus you need to hear all the other parts of the song just to listen to the chorus, just... Don't download this, you're wasting your time, i don't knwo if they will change this tho",1
"I can't choose the song that i want to play, Can you fix this ?",1
I Love Spotify premium Quality music app 😍🤗😘 Thanks,5
It stays on a black screen when i try to open it Please fix it,1
I love spotify with how much songs there have and even new artists i like it where u can listen to a song while doing something on a another appp,5
Won't show what's it's playing and how far you are into a song or podcast. Randomly stops when no ones pressed a button even with screen off 😒 🙄,3
My Spotify was before working properly but idk wht juz happened it's isn't opening...please do something,2
Spotify... I love you but i swear to God you dont respond to complains My playlist wont show up for no reason Fix it PLEASE i bet you,2
I like this app It makes me relax listening to music.,5
It has some nuisances but it's alright,5
Its an ok app but it sucks bc they add stuff i never want to listen to and I never hear the stuff I liked,2
Very happy with Spotify as I can find some of the more obscure songs that I like,5
Huge collection and clear music is appreciated.,5
Ever since the June 2022 update controls no longer work. The only way to pause or stop spotify is to close the app. Media controls indicate no media is playing when audio is playing.,1
I can't play any music unless I'm on my Xbox or laptop and I can't find my like Playlist or any songs I try to add just are not there in I'm now in a bad mood when I post this.,3
"Now they've purportedly removed the 10k song limit on users libraries I'll like the app even more. One gripe, I used to be able to play my entire library at random....can't do it anymore without individually adding all my liked songs and albums to a playlist. An arduos task!",3
I love to listen to music !!!! And so do I love this app,5
Lovely App. User friendly. Excellent database. Full marks!,5
Overall it is excellent but why I gave it 4 stars bcoz we can't download the music and that only makes me disappointed :(,4
"i don't like the update of spotify, when i log in and i gonna play a song it didn't play, the playlist i made is gone and the artists i follow. i wait but didn't work this is so bad.",1
This app is my most favourite to listen to songs but some songs are hard to find but I still find them I really love it and the opinions to like the video or save it is very helpful especially if I love that song very much and want to listen to it 24/7 Thank you creator for making this app😄,5
Wonderful music downloader app doesn't have any adds and enjoyable,5
You have to work on the UI also music suggestions are weak and not showing the new releases.,2
The best app for listening to music. This app even gives you the right lyrics of that songs. We can put any music at any time.,5
It has great music and I like it 👍☺️👍👍😀😀😀😀😀congrats to the programer or programers 🎉🎈🎈🎉✔️,5
"Ads, ads everywhere, I understand an ad every three songs, but not three ads for every song, since yesterday that's what I get constanta both on mobile and pc, is this a bug or what?",1
Its very discusting tumse achaa toh ganna hai salee spotify net is on tabh bhi no connetion dikha rha hai guys i suggest you download ganna app not Spotify,1
They are giving too much of ads,2
Nice with all diversity of beautiful music.,4
Wide variety of so much music available. Thanks a lot.,5
Stop throwing some random garbage in my suffle list already packed with more than a dozen tracks.,4
"I've been using the app for a while and with a recent update, something weird is happening. I'm able to play songs but not able to see the menu option (?) for the song, where we can pause, fast forward, playback etc. Is there any way to get this fix?",4
App keeps turning off since the last update,1
Spotify is it a glitch? When I click the song I like a random music will turn on. Or when I click the music it doesn't play full song. Please Spotify fix it I really need some songs.,3
music list Spr Sound quality Good Device Connected Like it And Play Music 🎶 Good feeling,5
"This app's updates are increasingly making it worse! The songs are very good even without the Premium version, but it makes it so that you will need to purchase it! Advertisements after a song ends once in a while is not that bad, but the main issue for me is the playlist customization. I can't rearrange songs, the playlist is always shuffled and sometimes it even plays songs that aren't even in the playlist for no reason! You can't even replay a song and it has a limit on skipping songs!",2
"Too many bugs, also I can't get the Spotify widget to stay on after a locked screen. I must unlock the screen, go into the app then change the song, pause etc... not worth the premium family membership fees. I have been a loyal customer for many years, now I think I'll change to another service or way to play music in my car unless it's fixed asap! STILL NO HELP REGARDING THIS ISSUE....",1
Great app for great music. 💯,5
"Every week, the app logs me out and I have to delete it and reinstall.",2
"Absolutely badass, way better than apple music",5
I encountered the same problem with one of the reviews. I cannot access the app. It only shows the logo and wouldn't respond afterwards.,1
Hands down the best music app,5
Brilliant and very Enjoyable everyday 😀,5
I enjoyed this app so much but if can be offline it can be more fun and every think is very easy to do I love this app so much,5
Way to many ads so get ready to cough up your clean lung to get ads free. audio quality is not original and stupidly compressed but Hey those Ads freakin CRISP!!!!,1
Easy to navigate way tyriuggt the app,5
Good but it's annoying that you need to listen to entire songs so you can cache them when you are offline. Great app though 👍,5
"This app is horrible you pick a song and it just make me listen to another song that I barely know probably it's cuz I use the the free kind but still it's horrible 😱. It just make me mad😠😤😡. Rating:3/10 ps. Listen to songs, play podcasts, create playlist and discover music you'll love more like music you hate😡",2
"Great app, van listern to music without wifi!!!!",5
"This app forces premium. I can live with ads and random shuffle, but now Spotify doesn't want to play my playlists I made anymore and spamms premium on me. It's very obnoxious and I can't recommend this app to anyone. I would pay if it was not this forced.. Currently a lot of bugs too.",1
"I've been using Spotify for a few years now, we've a family membership. It's great, I rarely find that they don't have a song/tune I'm after. I have my favourites, and every now and then I go through their suggested listening and sometimes find a new favourite. When I visit my Dad it's on with Spotify and we're filling the house with some oldies, such as Bert Kaempfert and James Last 😀",5
Good but if it was free it would have been the best which it is but I would like it if it is free,4
"So far it has been nice,but I feel Spotify can do better by making videos available and also making singles available for individual download",4
Can u remove the shaffle that we can pick songs if we connect to a device or we play on our phones,5
"Previously was good. Recent times (a year - last months) various technical problems that continue. Audio stops playing randomly. You can also suddenly lose the control buttons of currently playing audio (you lose whole player view; audio controls and info what is playing and progress bar) and have to shutdown and restart the app to hope to get controls back etc. Now I noticed problems with skip buttons. Everything might work ok for a while, then problems continue.",2
Play bar/controls keep disappearing and I keep having to force stop the app to get it back. Tried reinstalling but the problem is still there,2
Best app to listen to your jams & today Download. It's so easy to use and premium is worth every penny,5
I liked the Spotify that let me see the songs I had in my playlist.,2
Almost unusable after update. Crashes and laggs all the time.,1
"stuck on splash screen, tried installing and uninstalling but it still doesnt work",1
Please removes the add 🙏 🙏 😔 Except this i am fully satisfy with spotify,4
Stellar music recommendation algorithm one stars less.. for lack of individual song download options Also using my smartwatch controls leads to a bug where the currently playing song is wrongly displayed.... Edit Constantly downloading songs everyone and then,4
"What i hated here, is that, the premium feature, and random ads, And i cant click my own song, i can't skip, i can't click a song and it said i need to shuffle Music 💀😭😡🤧🤧🤧",1
The suggestion song was annoying!!!,1
Doesn't work just stuck on the Spotify logo no matter how many times I uninstalled and reinstalled or clear data or anything it doesn't fix it I have a MUI 12,1
Pretty good working with Google be better if billing could be added to phone bill.,4
It's OK but I don't get to listen to the music I want or save it without paying every month.,3
"It keeps playing suggested songs, and I have found no way to turn them off. It irritates me a lot and others are having the same problem as well. Other than that, its great",3
"Just switched to Spotify from Pandora and I have to admit that I like it! The lyrics function is very cool, I wish I could keep them always on instead of reopening lyrics for each song",5
Stuck on loading screen,1
I liked it because there were no ads. As soon as I rated the app I got an add.. like literally right after I gave it 5 stars. Now I'm hearing too many adds.. sucks.,1
Disappearing media controls (bug known since april 2022) still hasn't been fixed.,1
"Really great music streaming app, but it's unclear what qualifies as explicit in some cases",4
"Spotify was great until it stopped taking my credit card payments for premium Like JUST TAKE MY MONEY...PLEASEEE!!! Everytime I type in my credit card info it keeps saying ""payment can't be made. Country does not match payment option "". It matched for two months , what's the problem now?",1
Hectic with ads,1
"It's more money than I'd like to spend but the ad free unlimited version is worth it. Do wish they would be more understanding with the address verification with family plans as my children travel between my home and my husband as we have been separated. Sucks they don't recognize my son on our family plan bc he's only at my address part of the time. I'd also love if the playlist feature was a bit more intuitive to navigate considering I've had some from back in the ""starred"" era",4
"Suddenly I don't have the ""shuffle play"" option on mobile anymore. I can choose a song and then it will shuffle the rest of the que, but I can't just hit play and have it shuffle to a song. I used to be able to and now I can't",3
Pushy and intrusive. Auto connects to Bluetooth devices with no option to stop it. Has soured the user experience.,1
For some reason lately the app won't show that it's playing and just crash. Gets really had to keep track of podcasts and playlists,3
"Very buggy on Galaxy S22. After playing something, the play band/navigation doesn't show up and thus can't switch output devices.",3
"The sound quality is very good and over all the app is amazing,but the ads...😩. The ads are freaking me out,an ad comes after a song.Its killing the mood",3
The like button for added favorite song is not user friendly please add some warring or confirmation to like or dislike a song,3
Downloads always seem to disappear when I need them,1
Paying premium for music that skips. Not happy,3
"I am paying for this app and there is this very basic feature missing. I can't remove my recently played podcast, song from the home page look. Why? Every app on earth has this feature, why can't Spotify? Please suggest how to do it. I don't want everyone to see what i listened last if they ever see my phone.",1
Fantastic Quality.. Amazing music collection!!,5
I'm glad our favorite songs ate in the library,5
I love this it help me relieve stress,5
"My Spotify keeps prompting offline even when on data. Have done troubleshoot, still same!",1
spotify is not connecting to the internet ... i already tried all the solutions .. and not working. i do have internet cause other apps are working. even spotify lite is working. its just this version of spotify.,1
"It's a nice app I enjoy it but it misbehave after using it for some time, it doesn't show playlist you can't select a specific song in the playlists available. I know the is need for upgrade to premium but the limitation you have put in place are not important you can find another way not denying people to select their song of choice. At least downloading for offline is enough limitation for those who are not on premium. Anyway it's a good app.",4
I really like using Spotify.,5
When I play a song not a Playlist it plays a different song not Evan by the artist,1
Been some problems with playback lately,2
Been using Spotify for years now. I really can't fault it 😎,5
"*edit: take it back. same problems despite paying for it. 🤷‍♀️* when I pay it works! I had to pause my subscription, and the app got glitchy. I have uninstalled and re-installed several times, but it randomly stops working and the bottom controls are gone when I open it again. husband doesn't have that problem with a different streaming app, and we have the same phone. 🤷‍♀️",1
One of the better music streaming platforms; although the free version is steadily losing functionality that is migrated to the fee based subscription service,4
It's a good app....I can choose a variety of songs for my exercise...just enjoy more music 🎶 love Spotify ❤ 😍 it's addictive...,5
I love Spotify because wherever I go and whatever I do I can listen to my favorite songs,5
While it's fufills the needs of music when I make a playlist and I delete a added song it doesn't mean I want another one Spotify so ya the added songs really doesn't help when I have to pay 10 dollars(which I'll never do) just so I can listen to a song I actually enjoy. without skipping a couple of songs to hope to get the correct song I want to listen too,2
"Ever since the update, all playlists on spotify are telling me there is no music on then. But saying I can start a playlist. It's anoying.",2
Good app for songs,5
Really good app. Can at music in the background without premium. Not much ads at all. Great app. Reccomend,5
Spotify asking me to create an account and I already have one and doesn't automatically login now,1
"I loved Spotify before the most recent update because it would let me repeat the songs in my playlists that I like without having to shuffle and shuffling was only optional,also my music used to play without randomly stopping but now it does that often,I still love Spotify I just think the app was a bit better than before the most recent update,but this is all in my opinion.On the other hand, I like how you can listen to a piece of the song before you like it or put it in one of your playlists.",4
Very good and very useful. I use it every day.,5
Spotify won't load in and stuck on the loading screen,1
Cannot play any song online. It just freezes and stops songs. It wasn't like this last week so i was wondering what happened. I tried reinstalling but it's still the same.,5
spotify give me better experience for life!,5
Spotify is not an app thats good to have without premium though if you use the web player it gets better but i like the app very much i don't really have feedback,4
It's a really good app for listening to music on the go but I dislike when random songs I don't know pop up randomly,4
Downloaded podcasts don't play all the way through without internet. It completely defeats the point of downloading...,2
Not so good. Unable to log in even if i m a premium member. Also not able to download music. Premium services are not available but debiting my account without giving me services every month,1
"Free version of Spotify is awful now, instead listening to add to get 30 minutes of music you get two songs and over a minute of ads. Also premium keeps going up in price it's a waste of money at this point",1
I liked it how it was in the beginning all this updating I don't like it messes it up,3
Music is good but the problem is with advertisement,2
It is the best song app,5
I was just trying to logout and it made me leave the app and when I went back on it I couldn't even use it cause it kept me in the logo and this has been happening for 4 days now yall better fix this also fix the fact that we can't hear the sound while in suggest songs,1
The is very simple and smart to use,5
"what the hell?? everything was okay untill the new update. this app is impossible to use rn, the songs are playing on shuffle all the time and now they shown like a sentence or something please fix this :(",1
Very Authentic in its own way,5
I love the app don't give me wrong but the app has this problem of playing songs you don't want to listen to. For example I was playing my liked songs and it started to play songs that weren't on my liked songs. (Please fix this bug),3
Why can't I play songs on repeat,3
I love that you can make your own playlists,5
I love listen music and I love so many different choices!,4
"Downloaded on my phone multiple times, it's not working. It's a black screen with the spotify logo but that's it. Will not do anything else. App is up to date, just not working.",1
Spotify is the best music app but adds are dispointed,5
It's gotten so bad recently The ads are so much Now the app also started to just stop Playing and needs to force shut down automatically.,2
Best quality of audio but sometimes the ad will come in front of audio,3
This app used to be great and the only thing I'd use to listen to music but now I can't login or else it crashes my phone and forces it to restart. I can't delete it because it crashes my phone and forces it to restart and so my only option would be to factory reset my phone.,1
So far so good. It's been amazing working with you all.,5
"Horrible ad placing. Like there's literally 5 ads for every song. And they're not short 5 second ads no they're long as 30 second ads. That's a whole song worth of ads for every SINGLE song, like I'm not here for ads.",2
Very beautiful journey with Spotify,5
"Positive part is your library. Anything you search and it is right there. If possible, don't increase the volume sharply while playing ads. It hurts sometimes.",5
Nice except ads,4
The app is great. I just don't know why the canvas feature doesn't work,5
"Music for free!!! and song's you love,plus it recamend's music of the same johnra,come on",5
I love Spotify. Everything is easy to find and tailor fitted for my style of listening,5
"I love how there are so many songs to play from Country to K-Pop, plus it has some amazing podcasts. I would rate it a 5 star, but the only thing is, is that you cant change how loud or how low the music or podcast is, ye you could just lower down your phone, but if you have other things, like if you were playing a game, you wouldn't be able to lower the music down so you can hear the game. But overall an amazing app.",4
"I had a really good experience with Spotify But that was only when I had premium. when ur on the free plan u basically can't listen to music in the way you want at all. your playlist/songs are always on shuffle which is weird because sometimes you want your music in a certain order And then u only get 6 SKIPS an hour? So plus shuffle+ only 6 skips is already very strict. To add on you get 4 ads that are all 30 seconds, every 15 MINUTES. This is pushes people to other apps for a better experience",3
Easy to customised playlist. Wide variety of songs,5
It's good music service the only issue I have is the premium adds I don't mind having regular adds or not having more skips but the constant shoving in your face adds for premium are bad,4
"New to this , but had a good time listening!",5
I love the app. Its just too intelligent,5
"I want to stop downloading music because I'm not listening to it, but once I turn off the download, it continues to download, which is annoying because what's the point of turning off the download when it's still downloading? You should also include an easy-to-create playlist, such as my favorite songs. I put it on a playlist by category, but my patience isn't long enough to go through hundreds of songs one by one. There are many issues that can be improved. What a waste of money.",1
I love all the music but I hate podcasts. Literally less than zero interest in them but it's always shoving them in my face and often they have awkward pictures that I really don't care to see. The latest is they are in a language I don't even know so that's... cool... Would honestly give 5 stars if it weren't for that. I wish I had the option to remove the podcast section or at least dislike them so I don't have to see the awkward pictures.,2
Love this app. Easy listening has a lot of music and podcast anything ..its great.,5
This app is very very good to enjoy music.,5
Can be very frustrating to use at times. Ive had a old phone and now a new one. Same problems. Music rarely shows up what im playing on my home screen and sometimes doesnt show up at all on the spotify app when i clearly just select a song or podcast meaning i cant skip. To fix this you have to do a reinstall or logout login which fixes it for a time before going through the process again. I feel like they have also add a lot more shameless advertisement on podcasts for premium members.,3
Ok I can listen to my favorite songs and I don't need a premium I like the podcast,5
Brings in the best music I need to hear.,5
New like songs ui is ugly we need back old like songs ui 😩,1
"Update:- Thank You Spotify For Resolving below mentioned Issue.... ""Everything's great but lyrics are not displayed... Not resolved till now... My device is Mi A3, till date this lyrics issue is not solved...""",5
"Since the last 3 updates I have had nothing buy problems, app crashes every time I use it. Can't uninstall updates, this app now SUCKS. I use Spotify all day every day and I'm now forced to use Pandora which is just as bad, but at least it dont crash, if I could leave no stars I would. Dont down load this app",1
I'm loving my experience. Great variety of music and podcasts. Only downside is needing wifi for music that isn't downloaded.,5
"The play bar keeps disappearing. Only restarting the phone fixes it, but then it disappears again. This problem has been known for 2 months and still not fixed",1
Spotify is easy to use,5
"This app was ok but it freezes the music while playing games, then when you press play, it restarts the song or skips ... Fix pls",1
Can't play downloaded songs when you don't have internet.,1
music is nice but I'm tired of y'all playing w/ my playlist. y'all are so annoying bro. and the unnecessary updates bro AND THAT ADS! U DONT NEED THAT MANY ADS TO GEY MONEY BRO,1
Best music app that I had used yet,5
"Kept randomly pausing playing music and podcasts. Done everything to fix it but to no avail. Finally uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but can no longer access the application after that step. It remains stuck on the green logo and doesn't matter how long I wait, it stays there. I have done everything, cleared caches, forced stop, clean reinstallations, checked for updates on app and phone (Samsung s10), everything, and nothing works. Only this app has stopped working. I am a Premium user.",1
Easy to use app. Great to listen to the music you like.,5
"Have large amount of song to choose from. However, its hard to just want to listen only to specific track",5
Cannot update my premium. It always try to connect evn tho there is nothing wrong with the network.,1
It's the best music streaming I've used so far and cheap,5
If u pay for it it is a great ap to use but if u don't pay for it it will add songs in ur playlist and only give u 6 skips per hour,4
"Love it, so easy to listen to your favourite songs!",5
"worst possible app. constant bugs and issues, shuffle is a joke, and the weekly recommendations are at least 50% songs i already listen to. premium is losing its worth every day.",1
less ads would be great but I understand that you can't do that,4
I've been using this app for over 5 years. It's just recently started to go on another playlist once you've finished the end of your playlist it goes on to another playlist which is really annoying. But other than that issue it's a great app for music if you don't want to pay for iTunes and this is why I'm rating this app 4 stars,4
"I enjoy using the app and have all of my music, podcasts and some audiobooks all in one place. I wish there was a better way to organize files a little more specific then what is available now but I make it work. Quality has always been good! The one or two times it messed up after an update I cleared cache, forced stop and the reopened the app. Simple enough!",5
"It's a really good app and I love it! The only minor concern I have is the ads, but that's all! ❤",5
"Grate for tunes, great vibes man 🍃💨",5
Loving it! Took me this long to try it but it was worth the wait,5
Often does not work properly. As a subscriber I demand more,3
"Too many commercials, but I love the set-up. The music is great.",4
Absolutely incredible. Keep up the good work.,5
"Very good, one of the best music experience I have had.",4
"Honestly, I like spotify, but I've noticed a new bug: When I don't use spotify, and cancel any music, random music starts playing every 1 or 2 hours. This never happened to me, a few months back. Now it's happening constantly",3
Impossible to use liked songs will only play in shuffle controls are unbearable and the app is stuck on one song and will not let me play any others,1
Update has made it keep skipping its ridiculous,1
"Glitches CONSTANTLY, pauses ALL THE TIME. Def don't pay for a paid membership. What a joke. Worst money I've spent this year. Fix your app Spotify. If I could give you 0 stars I would.",1
"Just another way to be spied on by people with 💩 intentions- I miss the 80s You can laugh, but at least our every move isn't on candid camera, all our likes & dislikes are monitored. Technology is a donkey. Wait, that's mean to donkeys... You get the point- Enjoy your shower! May as well do it on the front lawn!!!! 🤪",1
It's alright I do have issues When looking for music Some you don't have when I try look for them,5
I want to cancel my membership but there is no where in the app to do so,2
"The amount of ads is pretty ridiculous. It used to play one ad for 30 minutes of ad-free listening, and it would do this /every/ 30 minutes. It was perfect. Now will give me like one 30 minute ad-free listening session a day. And when not ad free, there are ads practically every 2 songs. I would love for it to go back to the way it was, because I am absolutely tired of the ads.",2
"It has been an upgrade from our last service provider, pan something ?",5
"To the person or team worked on the search, nicely done! I normally only notice things when they don't work well or break, but the Spotify search is smart enough to match lyrics too, as well as correct common mistakes",5
Spotify playlist is perfect,5
Where did the play now bar go?!?! Also I can't flag offensive ads and dislike them. Suggested songs for Playlist should be an option. Otherwise good app. Thanks,3
Had premium for 7 years. Found my favorite music and the style that makes my life better.,5
Stop hijacking my lock screen with album art! I don't want everyone to know that I'm listening to the Frozen soundtrack 😂,1
Great app listen to it all day everyday,5
Very good choice of music. Easy to understand and use. Plenty of playlists to choose from.,5
More problems than any other streaming service. Even Deezer is more reliable.,1
"Your app needs a MAJOR redesign.The Joe Rogan podcast deal didn't make podcasts better on your app. Try a redesign of the UI that makes sense. That makes it easier to discover new things.Make it a more social and Connected network. Some new button deisgns, colour schemes, symmetry, minimalist.DARK AND LIGHT MODE. I can go on forever.Pump that cash into a user friendly design and make it available both for iOS and Android at the same time.Give users control.windows Xp media player visualisation.",2
When I play a podcast most of the time now it doesn't have the page to set a timer or fast forward the podcast etc. Considering I'm paying premium I expect better,3
I hate this app like there is a couple times when the Wi-Fi is strong but then it's still having problems working like it has its times when it doesn't work the way it's supposed to meaning the music won't work or the music will glitch which is why I hate this app other than that it's a pretty bad app it even shows lyrics which is good if you want to learn the lyrics of the song. I really hate the ads especially after like 5 minutes it goes to having three ads and everytime please fix that.,2
"i hate ads, but im poor, so what can i do, right?",4
Brings back many memories with the songs I chose.,5
I love this app but the only thing I don't like about it is that it repeats a lot of songs.,4
It's the greatest thing since jelly with peanut butter.,5
"perfect except that not playing what i want thing. its just annoying. (frankly reminding that TYLER, THE CREATOR is best)",4
Its good but the ads are annoying,5
Its good am movieng alongside hopefully to enjoy,4
"Was amazed with the customizing and shared info how awesome the choice of music was, as sometimes it can be humiliating, it's more relevant. I believe in this, and music helps me more then words can explain. This is one app I love and recommend.",5
75% of the content you'll be listening to here is back-to-back ads. I hope there's a way to delete my account somehow....,1
Great and wonderful to find any kind of music I love,5
I have a busted speaker and it is still clear and I hear the still clear,5
"Spotify is an app that I'm always using but since the new update, the app just don't want to open it freeze. I tried everything 😪, I don't know what to do.",1
It plays songs that I don't want!!! It doesn't even deserve a star!! Fix it!!,1
Wont let me skip or turn off shuffle spotify isnt bad but spotify mobile is horrible.,1
"i love spotify but on my new android (motorola 5g stylus) it randomly crashes the app during a song and when i open it back up the song is there but restarted, its really annoying and needs to be fixed",2
Because of your advertisement in this app.,1
its very organised but just because it needs data conection to work so its for the big spenders,5
"My spotify isn't working right now. My phone is Samsung A50 and every time I open my sporify app, it just stays on the logo. But in ny other phone, Asus, it totally works tho! I've tried reinstalling the app in my Samsung phone, clearing the cache, data and stuff but none of those worked and it's still broken! Please help!",2
"Absolutely amazing ,i enjoy using this app .Its easy to use 😘",5
Enjoy the music selection. Love it.,5
A+ you can find any song from anywhere you have to try this app for playing your music,5
it's very good but it's not letting me play a song when I click it it just makes me listen to another and i can't loop it,5
really great sound and selection and I love how you can listen on your phone and laptop,5
Cool that you can listen without internet!!!!,5
No interuptions.. Very little if there are.This is alright!,5
Great except sound quality could be much better!,4
Hate the ads for a min🤦,1
I love all the music that is on this app but listening to 3 songs and then 4 adds that I can't skip unless I pay it realy annoying. Would love to give a higher rating buy can't with all the adds.,3
"I love that I can get it for free and still create Playlists even though I hate ads it is a small price to pay for being able to use it AND it is very easy to use. I hope they NEVER change that. I play it on my Samsung cell phone, laptop, & Alexa Echo.",5
"Fantastic app. Had it for years, only sucks when your broke for a bit you lose playlist but they do keep it until your back on top. Great quality sound.",5
"Getting adds for premium while I already have it. Podcast pausing on it's own today. When I open the app while it's playing a podcast it brings me to the home screen like nothing is playing, no bar at the bottom for what's currently playing.",1
Consistly great. All music quality is too notch and I thoroughly enjoy most of the recommendations the app suggest. 5 stars.,5
"The update on the 28th broke the app on my phone. Can't follow progress, won't work with Bluetooth and frequently auto stops podcasts or music.",1
"I understand the need for ads, but come on... I'm getting 3 30 second ads after nearly every song",2
Simple to use...suggestions are easy to use and easy with a simple 👌 play button,5
"I loved this app as soon as i downloaded it . Its now giving a lot of issues. Like , i cant choose the songs i wanna listen to, i cannot even skip the song i dont wanna listen to . I go to shuffle to play the full version and it plays a song i did not even bother to choose. I think its unfair to those who cant go to premium because i cannot be paying every month , its useless. I dislike this app now. I wont waste my time going to premium. I hate this premium, so unfair.",1
It sometimes goes back to a songs it already played and i have to listen to them again.,4
The App is too slow. But overall it's a great app to play music,3
Ads+shuffle only at least for my experience with using this on the phone,2
"Music, music and more music. Access possibly the most complete library of recordings known to mankind, with Spotify.",4
I love this app to help you keep up the day with all the latest artists and leave music as soon as it is dropped on the screen lines,5
I've found so many new artists and favorites! Love this app,5
"I love the Spotify has Personal he designed playlist, That it releases weekly helps me find good new music, it's a great app",5
Best music app hands down,5
"Opens to a black screen on Android 12, then crashes. Reinstall didn't fix the issue.",1
I hate that when I drive the music just cuts out then I have to open my phone to play the music repeatedly,4
Best ever App I used to listen to my favourite music. I like the suggestions it makes once it knows what you listen to.,5
Just started using Spotify! Love my Playlist for driving and exercising. Lots of great tunes!!!,4
I love it because I can hear different music,5
Have used this app religiously but suddenly have been having issues playing music. Sometimes it refuses to even load artists or albums and other times it still plays music after closing out of the app entirely.,2
Great variety of music for all tastes,5
Ads are annoying and shuffle play is too but it still works regardlessly so it's a good app for music.,4
Best music experience ever you can find all the music you like . I love it ❤️,5
"Love love love it, always clear music and the podcasts are great. I especially love that I can listen to it offline",5
"Doesn't clear unfollowed podcasts or allow organization of home page. Tried clearing cache, data and removed all folders and files. Reinstalled and still have this issue. Makes the app unusable when driving which is my primary use case.",3
"can you please fix this app. Every time I go on the search bar to search some songs, my screen goes black and the song is not playing. Too many glitch.",1
Ad ad ad and just ad,3
I got 2 months free of spotify premium and they do a bunch of premium deals! I always listen to this to vibe:),5
Spotify changed my music listening habits from almost given up to fully addict to music. Radio station give you what they want you to hear not what you want to hear. Spotify changed all that for me. The best music app for me. #spotify addict.,5
Awesome music but way too much ads.,5
Love it awesome Playlist and student plan is for amazing for 4.99 of months,5
Great app.all types of song are available here.in the playlist i have a problem.i cant find the song which i want to listen.please fix it.otherwise i love everything about this app.Thx👍,5
"I thought Spotify would be a great music app until I actually installed it. I decided to make a Playlist and after 3 songs that I added myself a random song that wasn't my taste just started playing. Also when I searched up a song and clicked on it the song itself didn't play, I had to skip 7 times to get to it.",1
Much better now but still lacking in a few ways. I still really want the option to fine tune what kind of tracks play in a radio and to have a supermix for when I want to listen to a little bit of everything and not sure what exactly to listen too.... Edit: now just crashes on my a53 kinda disappointed,1
"I love Spotify, especially when I have premium",5
Love that I can find ANY song... Going down memory lane!,5
"I got Spotify Premium a few months ago. At the Beginning, everything was fine. A few crashes here and there. Now not even the currently played song is correct - like: how. Moreover buttons partially need minutes to react. Spotify tells me over and over again I got no connection, though everything else Internet related works just fine. The SD Card implementation just works for a part. The app is laggy, crashes and basic functions stop working over time. Please start working on performance & fixes",4
After last these last few updates it's become incredibly glitchy,2
Can be better. Algorithms can be improved.,4
Over adds while during using the app,2
"Love it but the button to report explicit content don't work. I don't mind the explicit content but it's nice to hit the block explicit button around the kids. Sucks when bad words get through. IT'S BEEN YEARS, FIX IT!!!",2
"Great 🎶 selection, a partnership with Boost so you don't use up your data, easy peasy to use. You can listen to whole albums",5
I can enjoy the music I choose.,5
Spotify has a large library and you can almost find every 9 out of 10 songs quickly. Spotify has become my favorite brand because of the service and overall experience. I've Premium Service so I never get hit by any ads while enjoying the music in very high quality. 👌,5
Spotify will soon join MySpace and Netscape...it keeps getting worse with every update.,3
Galaxy S21 + .....Music has now started to stop/pause for no reason during playback. Have tried everything and still continues to happen.,2
"Never plays the songs that are actually on the Playlist I selected, even when I search specific songs it plays ones I don't want. On the rare occasion it plays the song I do want to play, it only plays 3 seconds of the song. If I could rate 0 stars, I would. YouTube is a better app for music than thus garbage",1
Its is good but we can't download song without any purchase,5
The sharing option not working properly.,3
"Mine just stop opening this July 2022, Its stuck at loading screen (spotify logo) and doesnt open the app at all. Tried uninstall/install - clear data/cache - phone is up to date - app is also up to date. Please support 😔",1
Great music options and I don't mind the adds,5
"I really, really like this app alot so that I can listen to music at at all.",5
"Shuffle play is bad, also an unreliable app!!",2
Literally have to reinstall this app everyday. It just doesn't work. Probabally should end my membership. This is garbage.,1
This app is really good I really like this app This is really easy to find any song of blackpink and BTS I really like this app👍,5
"Recently the app has gotten really buggy - random pauses in the middle of a song or podcast, sometimes songs won't start playing, etc. Today's update is even worse and has made it so I can't even open it up. It just sits there and loads endlessly. I usually love Spotify, but the app is currently unusable. I'll update my review once they fix it.",1
Great app I could listen to my favorite playlist and I can turn of my phone while the music doesn't stop when the phone is on lock screen.,5
Good app but now song lyrics wrong having பாடல் வரிகள் தவறாக உள்ளது *Note this*,3
Its music. All the music. No BS except Neil Young and southern man don't want him around anyhow.,5
I find myself using apple music more nowadays because of the lossless stream option. The difference in audio quality is night and day.,3
"Easy to use,brilliant songs & artists.",5
"I can't change the order of my playlist, also some of the lyrics are wrong and I can find all the songs that I want",4
It been pretty cool wish that i had more than six skips but it fine like the app.,5
"Since the last upgrade, 6.28.22 Spotify no longer works.",1
"Idk what happened but recently it's been God awful. Affects Bluetooth, keeps cutting out, connection issues. It's just Spotify app having that problem They could use a few additional features(especially on their radio channels) but ultimately the best listening experience. It's great how they recommend songs.",4
Need to have regular versions of the songs you change some to clean and it's annoying,3
So easy so navigate.,5
This is a great app but at times it just refuses to launch. Has been like this on and off for a couple months now. Slightly frustrating.,2
"Highly unresponsive after you open Spotify from overview press at bottom screen. You have to either shut it down and launch it again or wait for it to load for almost 15 seconds, then the app wakes up and starts running. Very annoying and have to press almost 5 or 6 times to play a song.",2
Love the ease of use and the huge choice of albums. Use it on Wi-Fi for tunes on our Harley and our patio. Uses very little battery.,5
"A great app for music streaming, has a great free feature allowing basic music streaming, then the premium version is awesome allowing ad free and higher quality music streaming; While also being able to go offline.",4
Can't just download 1 song from album when rest of album is rubbish amazon you can and so much simpler to use,1
If I don't have premium and I try to listen to the songs on my playlist it playing songs that are not on the playlist. I would suggest that you fix that so that we can just listen to the songs on our playlist than listening to something that is not on the playlist,1
"Decent but......this app has potential to be great BUT the podcasts stop on every single podcast out of the blue, I have to keep manually hitting play which is not feasible to working in a clean room and not being able to touch your device. Please fix. Also, it'll play podcasts I've previously listened to and deleted randomly. Annoying!!!!",1
"The app was cool and easy to use at first, then it wouldn't let me pick what song I wanted to listen to and limited my skips. I was also trying to practice something and I can't.",1
Greatest music service ever.,5
Playback always stopped suddenly,1
"I generally enjoy Spotify, but lately it's been doing this thing where if I'm playing music on a playlist, it will play random songs that are definitely NOT on that playlist. Very annoying.",3
Perfect companion during long travels.. 👍🙂,5
"I wish it had less commercials but other than that I love the sound, the quantity of music and artists. A pretty nice app.",5
Impossible to listen to offline playlists unless started on wifi.,1
"i enjoy my spotify premium, It lets me play musics I want and gives me a time of my life. But when using another app or playing some as background music, The player keeps crashing everytime It plays only 1 song. Its annoying how i need to go back to spotify and play it again. But it repeats the crashing too, please fix this. My money is worth nothing if this doesn't even get fixed.",3
"I've only just started using Spotify, but I enjoy it. It plays the music I enjoy and, so far, no repeats.",5
"Has gotten better over time, but certain bugs like shared playlists not showing up in the list have been present for ages.",3
Won't play anything that I select. It just gives me a black screen. A little mad since I just paid for premium.,1
This music app is really good 😆,5
I love the update but.... my pc account dont have premium stuff but i have it purchased just fix it please. But that it have good song up to 10 million songs.,5
"The worst, most unstable app I've ever used for Android. Audio goes out when screen turns off, audio controls frequently crash while playing, integrated ads crash podcasts, audio skips, etc. I want to support Spotify because of commitment to free speech, but such an awful, unstable POS makes it a challenge.",1
This service is great but the app crashes and causes the app I am using to crash.,3
"Don't know why I'm paying for subscription, none of my downloads are available, it'll say downloaded, show how many i have, but nothing is available to play while i am out of cell and wifi range. Everything works when i have connection, but i download shows and music so i can play when out of service, which is like more than half of my life working in remote Alaska. Downloaded items should be available without a connection. Now after update, even with connection, i can't play anything",2
I like the app because it takes lesser time to find songs,5
"I love Spotify, but when I need to update it, my whole computer breaks (My computer isn't old at all, in fact it is only 6 months old) It can be extremely laggy, but I love it nonethless ( I just wish it didn't lag so bad and break my computer)",4
Lovely and the best app ever yo hear music. Thx for creating this app 👍,5
Ok I've resorted to begging because it's literally impossible to make playlists without being able to hear a sample of the song in the add section. Please. Just add that back and I will give 5 stars thats all I want. Why would you take that away. The only reason I dont switch music apps is because of how many playlists I already have at this point. BLEH. the bare minimum has been restored.,5
"great app, it's just when I click on a song it usually plays a random song.",2
Have used this app since launch and love it!,5
Easy to work,4
"app can't be opened, it was take long time to load. can u fix that problem asap?",1
"Too many ads, I understand that if I don't have premium I will need to see ads but there are too many! I already learned the Disney plus ad and I had no intention in learning it!",1
After every update it becomes worst Because ads increase almost after 2 song ads start. And it irritated everyone 😞😞😞😞😞 . Now I feel that downloaded song in your device is better to use this..... 😔😔😔😔,1
"I hope you add data saver where the lyrics and background videos dont play, For data users sake. And also i hope you give random related songs suggestions when we play so we can explore more like in Yt music app",5
I learned ro sing my gav songs on this aap its so good and there are relaxing asmr sound,5
I'm frustrated I can't listen to music no more I tried everything I uninstall it waited two hours to have the screen pop up it's just the Spotify icon the whole time I can't login or anything I looked up how to troubleshoot I tried everything I don't know what's wrong I'll change the rating till it works,1
wth is the update i lit cant do stuff unless i have premium,1
Where has the play bar gone?? I can't use Bluetooth or skip anything!!,2
"Please remove continuous ad of one product, for eg. Chand balliyan,rayban...i am listening this ad every interval of 3 songs.the reason I had unistall this app and one of the worst app i had ever used add every 2 songs interval itna toh YouTube par bhi add nahi aata yeh toh phir bhi....",1
My experience there is really good app I like the spotify I am the full enjoy,4
I dont like this app .... No one song is played in my phone ...,1
"Personally I really like it, 10/10",5
Playlist are not very Indian friendly,3
I LOVED THIS A LOT NICE APP. DEVELOPERS ALWAYS TRY TO MAKE THIS APP MORE BETTER AND NICE😊,5
I have been using like 4 years sound quality and loading works fairly but the problem is any music playlist I play it repeats 4 to 5 songs reapeatly please repair the bug. And please try to show less ads for the listeners who cannot afford premium account.,3
This app is awesome really recommend it from other people really good music app 😎,5
Great radio app love it just what I really want to continue to use.,5
I've had a very good listening experience with Spotify I think it would be nice if I had the option to make it have more bass or to be louder on my Android phone like it does on my IPad but it is what it is!,5
I think that Spotify is good but it doesn't have so many songs that I like but is still good,3
Too many Ads in it,1
I love Spotify and pay for the family premium but now it won't even open on my phone to login. I've Uninstalled and re-downloaded the app and it's still not coming up.,4
Gives a bit problem sometimes otherwise it's good and ads come very quickly,3
Is good but make it to be eble to search every thing and downloade,5
"Unskipabke Ads after every 2 songs played, poor-autoplay recommendation relative to YouTube, miniscule inventory.",1
Great music lists,5
I had music album and artist names on a longnote book for a long time. Over 400 titles.Now with Spotify i only had to upload these lists on the app for easy access and listening to my favorite music mostly jazz.,5
Music is fantastic and choices are righteous your style your choice,5
Love Spotify. Great app!,5
"Your app sucks... The autoplay doesnt work, I get to hear more ads than music... And I don't understand that why does the autoplay have so much issue... Update: The Auto Play still sucks... Update 2.: Now the app refuses to start... Update 3: Player has become buggy... Update 4: Repeating songs in discovery queue... Update 5: Your App Player is dead...",1
"I have been using this app for over a year but, recently the app has gone down hill. The ability to preview songs before adding them to playlists was removed making it 10 times harder to form a good playlist. Then there is the issue with the ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening."" It has never and probably will never be 30 minutes which just makes it unbearable to listen to. nvm its back now ads still suck though",4
"This is the best app for alone vibing but the one thing is we can't download songs, we should have a premium account",5
Excellent app but please get rid of the ads.,5
"🔥🔥🔥🔥, jus need more bronx drill , a lit more.. 🗽👿",4
"No video when attached to Bluetooth , joe Rogan is carrying this entire platform",1
My Spotify won't open and is stuck at the logo,1
Worked great until a software update. Now all the Playlist on my phone appear empty and Spotify claims it can't connect to the internet whenever I use search to fine music...,2
First you could choose songs from between your playlist and put your favourite songs but now you have to wait for you to listen to that song it's not how it used to be alot more things I would like to tell you but I won't I'll let the rating decide my experience,2
"I used to love this app. But after the update I'm hating this. The song which i want to listen, which i play it gives u another song. It's really annoying. I can't listen the songs which i want to listen. If you can't listen to your favourite songs, then what's the point to use spotify? It says you can only skip the song if you buy the premium one. Dude i don’t want to buy the premium one. Before updating this app it was too good but what happend after the update. It’s really annoying",1
Unable to dismiss the advertisements .. fix it,5
you can find almost all kind of music,5
Good range of music,5
I absolutely love being able to listen to all the old music.,5
awsome songs are there I love it,5
Its easy to use spotify apps music,5
"Amazing app, amazing playlist algorithm",5
"Every time a notification comes through since the update, Spotify pauses then never starts playing again. This includes Spotify's in-app ads. Pretty awesome when trying to listen while doing things and it's paused every few minutes.",1
I enjoy it especially listening artist from my country,5
"I don't like it, when ever I make a playlist then play it, it always plays the songs YOU added, it's really laggy even tho my wifi is good but I can still play sometimes, when I play a song the recent song played not the one that I wanted to play",3
One of the worst pain in this app is getting stuck on the loading screen it takes so long or forever. Please fix it.,1
Love! 💜 Highly recommend. -Francesko the Artist,5
"It has been great since I purchased premium but some of my songs don't get downloads I don't know what is wrong, can't see lyrics when offline and some of the songs are know where to be found like Park Jimin's promise and others. Before premium was hell like it has more ads than any other apps I've ever encountered, at one point i thought i might break my phone when ads came out of nowhere but everything is good now I guess except for those things i mentioned right above.",4
I hate this app because you literally have to wait an hour just to skip a song,1
Excellent app. Keep improving with new features,5
It's free music and all but there need to be a membership for ads if you are looking into it so do download and enjoy,5
"Too bad, not easy to use. The interface is very complex.Don't Download",1
"poor performance, too slow to load, more glitches, and even more low on quality unlike Apple Music. Sorry, just giving 2 star for now Update: now the apps gone stuck on bootlogo, i think i overspent too much of my credit card balance just for this useless junk app. Fix it or many would be dissapointed.",1
What's wrong I can't take student premium it again n again ask to verify me after that blank pages occurs what's wrong that Sheerid ???,1
Love the very much-loved tunes,5
I try to put on a Playlist and it says (this Playlist is empty) & when I put a song on it doesn't play. Spotify better be on the verge of fixing this cause it's the summertime I need my music Don't piss me off Spotify Get it fix,1
"great app, my only grievance would be that my favourite musical isnt on spotify, but thats understandable considering its extremely niche. anyways please whichever spotify representative reads this please contact william finn about getting In Trousers onto spotify.",5
Bro 💀 i tried downloading the app today and try it out but it can't even open Lmao 💀 plus i used to use Spotify and it would keep playing random songs and when i search up something there's always different results,1
Sometimes it plays and won't pause or pull up the play bar when listening to podcasts. Im new to Spotify and im wondering if I should find a different app to use. Seems to to have bugs that need fixed.,2
"Can you fix this please? Just please please please please please, I'm begging you, why i can't download songs in my premium, like, the download button on my playlist doesn't appear color green when i tap the download button, and i can't even go offline because of that",1
App needing update as studdlently stops repeating songs and other times when music randomly stops,3
Because Is easy to go back in the days true Spotify.,5
Definitely a five star app. It has every song in the book. Plus lyrics. And it's fast.,5
I like the no interruptions,5
"Confusing interface. Right now Spotify is way too complex, less is more. Right now I'm finally going back Google podcasts, soz",2
good app for nice song,5
Best ever Music app ever seen this kinda of app. It's so rocking. But the ad disturbs you seriously..,5
We don't all have bank accounts for premium. NOT OUR FAULT. At least create a physical account so we can deposit cash with reference to our email or OTP or something..,3
Even when I have premium I don't get premium features,1
Continue to have problems with app not stopping play. App will say nothing is playing but there it is definitely playing. I have to go into settings and force stop the app. Also will do the opposite. I will open the app and can't get anything to play and will have to force stop the app. Then it seams to work for awhile.,2
I paid for premium and am getting commercials. WHAT A SCAM!,1
Every thing is okay but only if you could make it usable without much data.,4
"Review has moved from five stars to one. 6yr premium customer, miss 1 payment, my account is removed from Spotify and all music lost. no contact number. Will be using competitors apps.",1
I have rock with Spotify from day one and they are the only music app that i will ever deal with. They are the best at what they do. I highly recommend Sporify to everybody.,5
"Used to be good. I have over 1800 songs in a playlist and it will play the same maybe 150 songs. It'll also be at ""the end"" of the playlist waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy too soon. What happened Spotify?",2
Realy nice app. I can hear music very clearly.,5
When I logged out it never opened again. I reinstalled and restarted my phone. It's still stuck at the spotify logo screen.,1
"While I think that Spotify deserves way more stars, I do habe some problems with the app in general. For example, while in Offline Mode, the app will repeatedly reset all downloaded songs, so that it simply doesn't work. The Playlist I've downloaded shows the little icon at the top that it's all downloaded, but when I scroll down, the songs just don't play and neither do they have the little download icon. It's just really annoying me because then I have to redownload the songs and use Data",2
Amazing if it was totally free,5
Good functions well designed,5
"When i am listening to music it keeps on randomly pausing the music for a split second the carries on playing it, or I have to turn on my phone to stop it from doing that. I have the latest update and it still does it. I think it is still experiencing glitches.",2
"I love ittttt, there's no ads even though I'm using it for free",5
Not a good and very bad but song are not played in front page. Mans will search the song and playing song,2
"Good,but advertisement more",4
Spotify is good because it's got all my favourite songs on.,5
Laggy and doesn't open,1
"It was fine until that auto shuffle happened, if i try to play from my liked Playlist, it plays songs that I never heard before. It won't let me play other songs without it being in playlist shuffle either. It would be fine if that wasn't added, Let people enjoy listening to the music they like and not have to pay for premium to stop that auto shuffle.",1
Pauses for no reason and podcasts just refuse too play at all,2
The best music streaming site there is!,5
"Wonderful music to listen to, anytime",5
"Ads are frustrating but Spotify always makes it easy to get a trial or extend user membership. The most user-friendly app for music and podcasts, in my opinion.",4
"it often doesn't load or takes ages to even open, and at some point it just stops me from liking songs which makes it really hard to even listen to some stuff. Overall it's a great app but it just gets on my nerves at the moment.",3
"I have used my Spotify on numerous devices over the years. That being said, Spotify has always been a challenge to play music and podcasts in areas with less than great cell service. Web pages and YouTube videos will load but Spotify will not. Very frustrating when I pay for this subscription. Saved music and podcasts take extremely long to register when offline and will often tell me ""no connection "" Overall I love the content so I will keep paying",3
"nice app,though can you stop shuffling my songs with other songs that i dont want to listen to?",3
Best live music streaming app I've ever utilized. I couldn't find any shortfalls not to rate it 5*****!,5
I took the premium but still I can't download and the episode can't be downloaded but it says u can but it's all fake 😭😡💩💩,4
"This app is amazing. I think this is the best ever song cloud,every song is on..OMG!..its amazing.",5
Spotify is a very good place to listen to music but it's not the best without premuim. But on the bright side premuim is not very expensive and in fact quite affordable it is a clever business method to earn and I'm down for it,5
Love the choice of music always on,5
It's very nice how can I describe it I don't know but is one problem that it is just when the internet but not with offline so I will give it 5 star,5
Cool and easy app to use,5
This is the best music app,5
Buffer quality is good.,5
Advanced app as compare to others.,5
I love this app this is useful app and especially this app in song with lyrics my favourite part the lyrics sometime I can't understand songs but with lyrics I easily understood songs i love it 💜💜😺🐻🐨🐇🐑🐴🐥🇰🇷🇮🇳💗💗💗,5
It makes the music clear,5
Best music streaming service out there!,5
"Awesome ,Ifonly they had kiwi classics like south side of Bombay would be a 5.",4
"I really love using Spotify, but for the past few days the app isn't opening at all. Until this isn't rectified, my review will be one star. Otherwise the app is great to use. Really sad about not being able to listen to my playlists.",1
Should have left the equalizer on there. If that was left then a 5 star all day.,4
"Best music app on my phone. But could still make it easier to find most recent and trending music, especially in my region",5
The quality 😍 Spotify playlist has made my life easier!,5
It always act up its not good whenever it starts acting up i thought of updating it but it does same thing again and again...no words totally lost it,1
What i know about spotify is good music just tips artist name spotify 1ina million 👏👏👏👏👏👏,5
"It is a very usefull app while your travelling,it can be played even your area's is poor",5
"While listening to long 4-5 hour podcasts, Spotify will lose track of where you are and start the whole thing from the start multiple times a day",1
Spotify's is an amazing app to listen to music but the only problem is that we can't keep the songs in the order we wish for and there is a big problem of ads in between....We can't break free of ads until we upgrade to premium...,4
It has every song you could possibly think of it's just amazing,5
It is a nice app but there is a problem that we can not download songs form it,4
I Love these access to music and freedom of selection. Your the best,5
Spotify is interested song 😊😊😇😇,5
I really love this app😌💜 Without premium also it works very well 😊,5
Best music app i ever saw,5
I'm using the app since one year it's sound quality is good but now the problem is from 1 month after I updated the app many of the songs are not able to play it's just disgusting to hear it in the Spotify so just take a look in to it..,1
Best app help me while I'm preparing for neet exam,5
This is the best song recommendation app. Also you can listen to podcasts which are very well designed.,5
"Since last update I have lost control of how I can play music, it stops for no reason, there is no play pause buttons anymore. The only way to stop the music is by closing the app. Today i can't even play music at all... What's next? Spotify any solutions? Do I have to keep paying for your no service?",1
The app is great but the update is not good when I try to play my fav song a totally different song play that I never heard and I can't restart the song I like I like the app when it dint update,1
"I loved this app but recently when updated I cannot play songs from the playlistd that I made and when i press the play button it says that I get only 6 skips per hour. I mean like ""WHAT THE HELL"". I want to play the songs in an order i have set my self. Not mixed. And whenever i play a song spotify premium keeps coming off. I'm deleting this song until this is fixed. Until then Bye.",1
Lots of playing options... both old and new school music...Top notch,5
I love listening to music so this a a great app for music. I can listen to music anywhere any time.,5
Only advertisement for our premium,1
Worse app ever..!! If we search good song for caller tune. It's not available. They can't search know songs also sometimes Jio team makes everything for business. At first everything was free not they are charging for everything,1
Why i can't play the song? I have paid for premium,5
"Hi, I've been using Spotify from 3 months it was a amazing experience but it does not open now it's saying I'm ofline but i have unlimited wifi access i have been trying to open it by deleting it and then installing it but it doesn't work please sort out the problem...",3
It is the better but a am chose one Star because this app ads so iriteded,1
My favourite songs!!!!!!,4
"Finally, I can listen every Queen song ever made.",5
I can't open the app anymore after I payed for premium and I don't think that is fair please fix this ASAP I can't listen to music anymore,1
Good but some songs missing in list,4
I bet it would be better if you can add GIF photo to your playlist,5
"Use every day on a paid for choice, so no ads. Just add to my play lists as and when. No drop outs & used the downloads option while on holiday so didn't have to worry about Wi-fi or data use.",5
"Its a great music app, i really love it but my suggestion is, could you make an update where we could download 1 song and not the entire album, because if we have to download all the song in the album, its really consuming our storage on our phones.",5
Changed my review because the app didn't work for me. I accidentally logged out from my acc but when I tried to login again the app just blank(black). Nothing. I've restarted my phone and reinstall the app but still the same thing happened.,1
Bad Experience. When streaming/playing downloads the glitches or stop playing. Why there is no support desk?!,1
That is a good music app,4
It used to be a great app but now it just became bad. You have to watch atleast 5 videos after a song and you only get 6 skips an hour (a ridiculously low amount). When you find the song you want it ridiculously plays a different song by another singer instead the song you want. I'm not sure how you guys get payed to do this but you need to fix it now.,2
"It's awesome ,but too much ads interupt",4
"What happened to Spotify it's not the same, whenever i choose a single or album the songs are not there and when i it different music will play",1
Dears kindly i have a problem with the app after i updated my phone as the app does not open,4
I don't understand why I can not play back the music of my choice I only have an option to next 6 times in 1 hour,2
Keep it that way. Ads free,5
Mc why too many ads always.,1
Please make us play any song without using Premium,2
Podcast is good & clear,4
Excellent great music app 👍.,5
so enjoyable and relaxing 😎😎😎,5
Worst app Finding ways to just earn money everyday,1
The new stranger things theme is so cool or as I should say it's bitchin.really enjoy it.,5
"I don't what happened But all of the sudden it Stop working So, i tried to restart the app but it now just show a blank screen i tried about 15 installing and uninstalling it but still won't work",1
It's great. All the music I could ever wish for.,5
"Always barges in. Connect phone to the car, spotify app starts playing. Connect it to ANYTHING else it starts playing. Overrides EVERYTHING! Can't kill it, even a forced stop can't stop it. This is the most annoying BULLY app I ever download. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. LOOK FOR something ELSE.",1
"Great, but I was hoping to be able to change podcasts while driving, but that seems dangerous.",4
"It's a great app, i just wish the playlists were not shuffled by songs that are not in the playlist",4
It so good 10/10 the best place to lease to music,5
"Frequent crashes, also I pay for the premium and still get advertising for the JRE!? Still better then pandora but maybe not worth buying.",3
"""Offline Mode"" is the biggest useless feature ever. I might actually cancel my Spotify acct over the amount of times I've tried to listen to my DOWNLOADED music while away from data service and CANT. HOW USELESS.",1
My experience with Spotify is great. I love this platform. Thanks Spotify team.,5
WAS a good app. Until you couldn't play the song without shuffling. And the layout is different. I advise you to go back to YouTube music. At least could play a song. :(,2
"Great, love the choices and suggestions",5
Fantastic range of easily accessed music,5
There's many songs but you can't listen to them free. So it's very disrupting that there's add and sometimes you have to wait for skip. It's like everything have to be payed to do something.....,2
I've been using spotify for years and overall it's okay I just don't like that after every 2 or 3 songs there's an add.,4
Great Music App.,5
"I'm an Spotify user since many years. Never faced any problem but now I'm not able to share my lyrics !! My device is completely based on Android 12 , and the app is up to date !! Please look into ⚠️",3
"Please make it easier to get to the equaliser, from the current song menu would be great, deezer has this function. Why is it so hidden?",4
This is best listing app I ever seen,5
I wish I didn't have to use data whenever I wanted to listen to all my songs at once,4
"I can't live without Spotify,i love it",5
The app is so useful. You can listen to the songs while doing anything n everything. Songs makes emotions more valuable. But I think they should decrease the rate of ads a little bit that's why I am giving it 4 for now but It will be set to 5 when the ad rate is deacresed. The song quality is so good that's why I will recommend to use this app for sure.,4
You have to buy there stupid premium just to play a single song I literally have to go through 20 songs just to get to the one I want,1
"I’ve been a Spotify user for a long time, but just this year I’m having some discomfort using Spotify. My internet network is very good, but it’s hard to play music",3
Too many ads,1
Really good on Xbox I can listen to music as I play games.,5
"Everything is way good, but make a comment section for every song, so that people can write their thoughts on their favourite songs. In this way the music artists will also come to know, how listeners feel about their creations. -Thankyou :)",5
I don't like the new update it's confusing,3
Group sessions don't work at l All,3
"Hey! Spotify team please help I am trying to login to my Spotify account for past week with this same email id and i have made many attempts but my account is not opening 🥺🥺.. I also have a student plan and most importantly my life without music is so empty, my day starts with listening to music and also ends with music.. Please resolve my issue ASAP..PLEASE 🥺",1
Very nice music app. Other junk apps have ads that interrupt my sleep process. This just works.,5
Too slow and can't choose music to play,2
Best dang app for music ever,5
this is free music with hardly any time having ads but when you do get ads there are at least 2 ads that aren't skippable but its worth it five out of five spotify if you see this review I just want to say thank you for it not having to be paid for,5
My playlist keeps being shortened somehow and everytime I play a song from my playlist and close my playlist music stops and I can't play it it was fine yesterday but today its rlly bothering me..sorry but can u fix what's going on?,2
"Hi, can you fix it when i play my favorite song it always short song",2
"Terrible. Not worth it. Used to be great but now I can't get through one song or podcast anymore without it buffering or skipping. Even downloaded songs have issues. I tried everything- resetting my wifi, removing all downloaded songs, clearing the cache, lowering streaming quality, uninstalling then reinstalling. Don't waste your time with this one",1
Spotify is not working in my phone,1
"I think spotify is great but its 5 times better with premium though and i think $10 a month is not that bad. It has absolutely all songs created. Overall I think spotify is the best app for music, podcasts, and stories. Such qaudale dingle.",5
its playlists are awesome,5
great nothing found wrong but how can u download songs From therer,5
"Not opening on my mobile.. Just showing a blank page with logo and then gets stuck.. I cleared my cache, updated to the latest version, rebooted my device, still the problem continues!",1
Music quality not so good,2
"It bothers me that when you don't have a premium when the ads come on they sound 10 times louder than the music sounds, which is a problem when you listen to music with a speaker or with headphones, because it forces you to turn up the volume because you don't listen to the song and then feel like you're going deaf from the commercials",2
Great music of the 70s and 80s,5
I cant seem to get a way to download a song and listen offline. But the app is so far so best,4
One of my Favorite apps of all time. Been using them for about 9 years now and they keep getting better !! I'm up to 30 hours of Amazing Tunes on my Markus Aurelius PL 1. Check it out and subscribe. You're gonna Love it I'm sure 😀🎸🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶✌️,5
complete trash to say the least can't even open my liked songs,1
Love the app and now they're adding lyrics. If they can add more interactive stuff like the end of year round up that would be great.,5
I love all the songs it's great,5
"Excellent quality overall! I very much appreciate that a person can close the app and still have the music playing. Also, WIDE VARIETY OF GENRES! Anything you can think of!",5
Has almost every song I have ever searched!,5
It's amazing but payment is the baddest idea here,3
Waste of time there no song if you want to listen a song then search its singer's name that is always worst app for ever,1
Just switched to ad free,5
I try putting a song but it shuffles and puts a different one,2
i just love spotify:),5
I love it real simplicity,5
To much add without subscription 😐😐,3
"I give this 2 stars because everytime I open the spotify and play some music it always say ""no network connection"" even though our WiFi is doing great. Please fix this. 😤☠️💢",2
I just love it ☺️ can't explain more. I listen to any music I want and helps me to know many different artists,5
"It always complain no internet connection whereas my net is already working for other apps. It was so frustrating,please check with your networking code backside what outdated protocol they must be using",3
"Please increase the volume of the musics. Sound quality should be more good, rich and enhanced. In home tab, contents are taking much time to load. Make spotify lightweight and fast. There have huge battery consumption while streaming.",2
Exceptional. Large variety of programming options.,5
Honestly this app is just all around amazing. I have no bad things to say.,5
"One night I just turned on Spotify, when it said my free trial was up... The one I diden't even ask for. I was ok with it untill I saw my playlist. The only option was ""shuffle"" I couldn't even listen to the songs in order! I tried to, and whenever I clicked on the names of the songs listed out, and would only let me hear a clip. I need music to go to sleep. The ads where loud even though I had my volume down. Still anoyed, the layout is WAY to complicated if you don't have primium.",3
"First time not opening the app, bad app",1
"Sad because of blatant censorship. My podcast episodes with the COVID ""warning"" on them, crash the program. So effectively I cannot listen to any podcasts that do not fit the narrative.",3
Sound quality in premium category has decreased. Earlier I was really impressed compare to any other music streaming app.,3
I can't play my playlist:/,1
"totally love this app, I don't any trouble looking for muaic on my current mood because the app already has category that you can choose from with any current state of mind you have.",5
So difficult to play songs and keep songs... Not suitable to play specific songs you want but good for random playlist,2
I don' t like this app.I can't listen my favourite song in play list with out premium .Because the playlist does not play the songs we want.,1
Hey there . I am daily listener of Spotify.And I also want a primium subscribtion. So I request you to add a reedeem gift code payment method to primium plan. Thanku.,1
I love being able listen anything I want to.,5
Excellent especially the playlist they give takes me back,4
"Sound compression is lossy , surely it is aac ,im expecting least flac from Spotify, Tidal is best in this manner.",4
Why so many ads bruh.,3
Stuck at logo and loading screen after I log out.,2
I like spotify and would reccomend it to anyone that wants a wide variety of music to choose from. If you can afford premium i highly reccomend it but if you can the base version is also really nice,5
Bad lyrics. Poor sound quality.,1
"UI looks amazing, and listening experience is also good when compared to other apps. However, ads keep increasing on every new update.",4
I'm in Spotify premium but why there still ads I'm try to relaxing and suddenly ads appears pls fix this 🥱,3
The liked artists association selection is a liked feature. Brings up some bands that forgot about. That's for the reminder.,5
This app delivers more than just what I expected. Very good.,5
Spotify is great I don't have to keep turning my phone on to keep listening to music although after 2 songs on my playlist it switches to a random song that is not on my playlists witch gets me anoyed,3
This app is so good for me to listen songs,4
"I love Spotify ❤️ I can find old favorites as well as explore new-to-me music recommendations generated by the app. I can create my own music lists, search for others or listen to Spotify's recommended selections.",4
To gud. But only problem is that not download songs without subscribe or paid premium,5
Have good music listen to it and u can shut off ur phone and it still plays even when sleeping.,5
Awesome Besides having to pay for it,5
"Various issues from not loading/crashing to playing songs without actually playing, song plays but no bar down the bottom",2
Some bugs and repeatative ads are annoying but the auto-play is world's best system,5
Make it fully free cause we all need music!. ill give yah five stars you gotta be kidding with the extra pay just to use it with a Fitbit like woooooooooow just stop!,2
"I work with 4 music apps, each one has a few + and a few - items that come to mind. In a perfect world you'd think someone would bring the best options together to form a more perfect super music app.",4
"Trash app, ads after every 2 or 3 songs. Lucky that there's hacked spotify",1
I can find all the music i like. Especially all the old stuff that is hard to find on other apps!,5
Its great love it only not 5 stars because sometimes you cant play certain songs on some devices im not sure why but i love spotify even with that problem im gonna forever be a premium user,4
I can't get my Spotify app to work been working on it fo r days what's the problem?,1
Nice. Good collection of songs,5
Best one for the underground stuff.,5
"So easy to use! Thanks, kd",5
Ok so I can't play my favorited music it says that there is an error and won't load I will raise the stars whenever you find a fix.,1
Spotify have every type of style of music,5
Too much ads without subscription,4
Too Too Too Too much ads.... Highly disappointed 👎👎👎,2
Very good experience.....with spotify i'm enjoying a lot....,5
"Spotify has been around for a long time and know how to make a good music app. Everything is laid out simple, finding songs and making playlists easy.",5
Well selected music to my taste.,5
Amazing streaming music app! The sound quality and collections of songs very nice. But some of movie songs not available in spotify. Please add those songs soon.,5
It used to be great but now it's restricting and quite unusable it's forcing us users to go premium if you don't change it like before I will delete this app.,2
Perfect.. Just perfect,5
"Amazing and great! You get all different types of music, and you can share with friends and create podcasts and Playlists.",5
I love this app but I I have been having some problems with my liked songs in my library and it only plays part of the song. And I can't change the song at all,2
The app lost all my playlists last week and no matter how many times I reinstall it and the SD card it will not work. I am travelling this week and it looks like without my music. Why do developers try to improve apps but just break them instead. Pissed off.,1
I love Spotify.,5
This is the most best music app I've been on.,5
"I would really to buy a subscription, but podcasts are still unavailable in South Korea. Any idea when this will change?",1
My favorite entertainment for my ears.,5
"Uninstalling spotify, heats my phone up, drains my battery big time and always running in the background.",1
I think that it amazing just that you have to pay,4
too many adds,4
"I'm a man of few words. I think Spotify for me personally meets ALL of my expectations, you should give it a try.",5
Now is easy for me to hearthesongs I already download in my list of library album music,5
Was nice if u reduce the length of the ad,5
Spotify is not working on Android auto please fix it,2
It is awesome considering I use only the free version the only thing that I would you know put into a better category would be if it updated with the new music as the artist produced it,5
Too many ads,1
"It's a great app but there are so many adds inbettwen the songs, albeit they only pop up after about 3-7 song or if you restart a song. But I've had I up to 8 ads in a row before my next song began to play, and the ads could range from 15 to 30 seconds. But the audio is great and all the options in the settings are enjoyable. So, the main thing is want changed is the huge amount of ads, after all they take up more time then most of the songs themselves! It's just overkill at this point.",4
would be 5 stars but when I'm playing music when I've listened to every song it plays random songs,5
"Great app, free version might have ad breaks but still great, thanks Spotify 👍👍👍👍👍",5
Love have splotify premium not to expensive love how I can go offline and download music. Using the car mode is easy makes everything bigger all in all would recommend trying premium,5
I wish it would play more of my original voice material..,5
"Bro this freaking app says I have no internet even when I do, this is so annoying let me just use your ducking app already",1
No pause and play button for ages!,1
"Free music, and top choices, something not to like? Listen!",5
"I love how the app does not require downloads, but the fact you cannot put songs on repeat without premium really sucks",4
Good app. No app like this to provide songs free,5
Let the app keep the phone unlocked while playing or I'm not resubbing. It's dangerous while driving otherwise. And it USED TO DO THIS!,1
Spotify is the best. 👍,5
"Excellent. I love this platform. It has all the music I used to listen to back in the day. Plus an amazing collection of Christian music. And the podcasts, (which I was unaware were available), are great too I would recommend Spotify. Hours of entertainment.",5
"It is harder to add a ""Spotify premium"" $30. Dollar card, and open an account than it was to blindly purchase the card. I wouldn't suggest this app. To an associate and have 'Him or Her' Angry at me when they purchase a Gift Card, and have a problem to using it.",1
The best app for listening music and podcast,5
Spotify without premium is very stupid,2
...'plugged' in a few artists and get more artists and tunes I like.,5
"Horrible experience. Ads middle songs. Middle my sleeping med. music. Wakes me up in shock, coz its super loud and out of context. Impossible to rewind the song or play again. Its like fnk app try to tell you how to listen to your music. Its pathetic. If there would be server, jumping in every 5 min in my coversation to promote menu unless i pay 5 bucks, id break his nose. These ones are hiding behind the screen and doing same thing. Downloaded evwrything elswhere. Vomit",1
Superb music selection 💯👌🏻,5
I love it so much but the adds are horrible are you guys hiring,5
"Never fails me, especially when I need the right song at the right time",5
Best music app there is nothing beter,5
My translator disappeared and also there's no karaoke option,1
"Spotify keeps stopping mid song after I start. Happens sometimes every song, sometimes every 3rd but always happens. I'm the only one who uses it, cleared cache, uninstall and reinstalled, dont use power saving mode ever, have perfect Internet, deleted all my data and saved and started over and it CONTINUES to happen. I PAY for this, if its not fixed in the next couple of days I'm cancelling my subscription because this is pathetic at best.",1
Best music and it has all the music u like,5
"Terrible, you can't even pick an exact song without paying $10 a month, just get YouTube vanced, it has way better selection, you have the freedom to pick the actual song you want to listen to and there's no ads.",1
"I use spotify on a phone and ,oh boy, it's a nightmare. First of all there's a ridiculous amount of adds,you only get six times to skip a song and it resets in an hour, and you can't pick what song you listen to, there's only shuffle.",2
Stop adding songs to the Playlist i create if I wanted to listen to that music i would have played a list that would have me discover songs! I created my own Playlist so I don't have to use my skips looking for a song I want. Very disappointing the app would be great if this was fixed. Don't wast your time getting frustrated.Please fix this,1
Listen to good music and old music,4
Wanna break from the ads tap now to watch a short video,5
Love listening to my Spotify. Any place anytime. Even with commercials,5
Same issue not opening app completely can be fixed and review updated,1
It is a good app to play music on and I lessing to my favorite music what I like,5
"Even when I was using the free version with ads I found the way Spotify offered selections based on what I had been listening to, really good, because it gave artist I had forgotten as well as those I had never tried.",5
"It is a very beautiful and useful application. I want to download songs, how can it be done.",5
I really like Spotify,5
One of the best music apps around!!!,5
All the free music and shows you could possibly want and more. Creations abound!,5
Excellent and lovey way to listen unlimited music. Please make language wise categories i.e. Sindhi music or urdu music,5
Why do I need premium to listen to my favorite music,1
My overall experience was amazing! I've discovered new songs that I didn't know l would like! So thank you for making this app. <3,5
"The app is not bad overall, just the fact that it takes a few days for lyrics to be uploaded after a song has been released. Also not all songs have lyrics. Bhorex",3
They gave me 6months free trial and so far love it,5
The media player outside of the app and the progress bar inside the app disappear way to frequently. I have to hard quit the app multiple times to resolve the issue.,1
"Annoyed by how many unstable ads there are and decided to review about it specifically. I get around 10+ ads in a row and only 2-3 songs. Maybe 5 ads in a row at least. This is normal when I play music, and it shouldn't be. Rare for my playlists to have no ads for 30 minutes as Spotify states. It used to not be this messy. Please code whatever to fix this, it's an everyday situation. I shouldn't jump from each playlist to try and find the right spot to get ""30 min free listening.""",3
Add a damn option to confirm whether you want to connect to a certain Bluetooth device or not. Had too many occasions where the options for connections would bounce all over the place due to constantly finding and forgetting ones only to mis-click away from the thing I wanted instead to a device someone else is always using. Awkward to use and inconvenient.,2
It just stopped working,1
After two or three song they give a long add which is really anonning .when I use the first there will have add but add remain after the 30 min,2
"This app is good. But for some reason, The Shuffle is always on... But when the PC version comes into use, it's always off. Is the songs policy always behind a paywall or you guys just want to get money by premium... This isn't why ""Free"" streaming apps are for... The shuffle isn't helping you by you're problems.... It's just making the listener's mood and their problems unsolvable...",1
I've had the same Spotify premium for 6 years and let me tell you. WAYYYYYY better than apple music or Amazon whatever it's called. 10/10 recommend. Keep up the good work Spotify. I love you ❣️,5
The only problem is when you dont have premium it gives you like 6 ads at a time,4
"Great , affordable Music app!",5
"Podcasts turn off by themselves, sound plays without app controls",2
"Was a good app but then all my playlists started coming up with: we added... Which is really annoying, because u can't get rid of them. It also only let me play 5 secs of what I wanted 2 play, so after the last update it is bad",3
"Any music I want, anytime. I love it!",5
I love the Stranger Things effect. Five stars if you can let let Vecna pop anytime!,4
Worst app not songs only adds wast of data,1
"Scale of 1 to 10, I'll go with 10 an easy way to get your old but goodies song! ❤❤❤",5
Way too many ads. Jst to for for premium.. Are u guys serious I mean i cud download music files form somewhere else.. And if I want latest music I cn check on u tube seriously u guys are getting worse and worse jst belive me after some month or mayb a year this app is going down,1
"I have been using Spotify for over 2 years and after this update, I'm no longer able to play any music. All my playlists are empty and I'll open up Artist playlists and they say empty as well. Says to check my internet and I'm connected, all my other apps are working, just not this one.",1
I absolutely love this app. The free version is amazing and premium is even better. I get to listen on the way to work and simply whenever I want. There's music for everyone. As a lesson whose tastes varie from day to day and are simply all over the place I'm very satisfied. They also have people who are willing to help if there are any issues. 10 our of 10 in my opinion.,5
Too many ads. It's annoying.,3
"Its the best especially, if you have premium.",5
I love every aspect of this app!,5
"Great at finding songs, and making recommendations.",5
"There's no order to shuffling, you'll be listening to an up-beat song and suddenly an extremely depressing song comes on, it really ruins the mood. I'm sure if they can organize their playlists into upbeat and sad songs, they can organize their shuffling.",3
"This app has lots of podcasts and I love those , you can also try these podcasts of Crime & Thriller.",5
App is broken on android. Does not play music. Does not list songs in playlists.,1
"Hi this app I great but it keeps adding songs I don't want on my playlist and it's really annoying because I don't like them. Please fix this, thankyou",3
Was going fine with the app for a couple of days then all of a sudden it refused to let me in I can't listen to any of the songs on my playlist without glitching I'm very close to deleting this app 🤬,3
Easy to use and very wonderful,5
Lately the app has this pause thing going on whilst listening to some music. Once thought it's my headphones but it was not,4
"If I could rate this a 0 I would, My name is Hannah and I'm 11 and I absolutely hate this app. I downloaded it and signed in made a playlist and what happend you may ask, well they added what they wanted onto it, it's so rude and when I tried to delete it of it said that I couldn't because they had picked it special for me, and it wouldn't let me play any other songs in my playlist, so just like that an hour after I down loaded it it's been installed an hour later. I'm never downloading again",1
Its perfect Music To use for study or for fun some to use to dance to and sing to it is perfect,5
Very good app for any other music 🎶 you can find what ever you like to look up.,5
I cant play my favourite music cuz im free listener before 2 days ago I could to play my favourite music but now I can't I think because im in free mode,1
I love the music selections and the ability to create my own Playlists. Thank you to all of the Artists who've contributed their music to Spotify! Happy Listening 😃,5
"A good music app ever. However, consider the option of saving to either memory card or flash disc.",4
"Great, easy to use. The cross fade between songs is a nice feature",5
"The app is amazing! I really love the interface, its easy to use, and collation of suggested playlist is awesome",5
My Spotify apps was force stop,5
Love it but one downside is i pay $10 a month for downloaded songs that never show up when I dont have signal. So it's kinda feeling like a waste of time and money.,3
Is a nice app I could listen to music while going on long trips,5
My app is not working i have the logo in the middle of the screen i restarted it and i uninstall it and download it again still not working help,1
"Anyone who has loading issues after the update, read on! Take out your SD card, restart your phone, and launch spotify. It worked for me after doing this, even after reinserting the SD card afterwards.",3
"App doesn't perform well, but I like the layout and the features",3
"I love the app, but it would be really fun if there was a drag and drop functionality between playlists in the desktop app. I know that's hard or maybe not possible to implement, just a thought.",4
Wont let me play my songs and keeps playing other songs.,1
Everything is v.well but when i search a song then single song isn't shown as search result then i played album then it's auto set on loop then the song isn't played another artist song played i don't know why but please change this feature or guide user.,2
Really good app to listen to music with! Downside is that you need mobile data to listen to music when you don't have Wi-Fi and to get no Wi-Fi/mobile data needed to listen to it you need to pay and some people are broke as *cough cough* me *cough cough* 😭😭,4
Is just a great music app in general,5
honestly the best music app if you ask me,5
"So easy to use and has everything I need. Great for all ages too, and Spotify Premium is perfect for me!",5
"Skipping during every song, especially on lock screen. Typically won't play it at all on lock screen. Please fix!",3
Love the app. Music selection is great and the mixed tapes they make for you are perfect!,5
Please fix this update. Why am I unable to rewind anymore? What is happening?!,1
The best music streaming app out there,5
"It's nice when l don't want to watch TV I have a great selection of music oldies and modern to listen to, goes with my moods brilliant",5
Great user experience with a cheap premium option that make listening very enjoyable without ads. The AI is fantastic and suggests songs I have never heard of that match my music taste,5
"Used to put a clip of the song in items shared to other platforms... no longer. Very sad, was 5 stars.",3
"I love it and it's great, on the road, at home or enjoying with my friends we all love Spotify. So good job and keep at it..!",5
Great music platform,5
Amazing 👏 absolutely can't live without my Spotify finally a site/app that works better and less data streaming use then YouTube 👏 stay bliss yall 💕 much love Lil Savage69,5
"Newest update is terrible. Sound just cuts out and needs to be restarted manually. Also, no way (or not an easy way) to get to episode to restart or rewind.",3
Spotify changes my playlist to music I did not select. I find this annoying,2
Sad to say that since the latest Samsung phone update Spotify will not work. It appears to be connected showing green moving bars on the tune selected but is mute. Also the app appears frozen as it is not possible to start or pause.,1
The first app which is bestest for listening musics,5
Excellent job with lyrics. Love this app ❤️,5
A have a lot of problems with it but the most important is the fact that I can't search up a song and play it on its own without listening the that specific whole album. And if you try selecting the album to pick out and play that specific song it won't work it just plays what it want from that album. And also freezes my attempt to skip the songs till I get to the one I want after 6 tries for one whole hour. I was actually trying to rate it 0 but I see 1 is the lowest,1
"Works in my smart TV, plays good song, everything available. I always buy the premium subscription and I highly recommend it.",5
"my spotify started freezing and won't open. When I try to log in it pretends to log in and then shows the login screen again and doesn't log back in. It started happening like this last night, I logged out of my account and it stayed that way. I deleted the app, restored or restarted but still the same, please help.",1
I've been paying more for less. Every time I open the app I'm spammed with an ad about some new content from someone I've never shown interest in. Now I'm getting ads for their car thing.,1
Love to stream podcasts and wide variety of music.,5
"Honestly in the beginning I loved Spotify. I even decided to start paying for it so I could listen to music with unlimited skips and no commercials. However, in the past few weeks, especially since getting my new phone the app randomly stops playing and turns off. When in my car it skips like a CD constantly. It's frustrating and frankly I'll probably cancel my subscription if not fixed, even if it is a minor inconvenience, it shouldn't be happening.",1
It's cool I hate how persistent the ads can be sometimes but yeaa,4
"Same old glitchy BS from the beginning. This service isn't worth the money. Won't play app closes itself. Stop playing randomly, start playing randomly. So all and all not worth it",1
I do love this app. I use it daily.,5
"What the hell happened?? I used to love using Spotify but now it keeps pausing randomly in the middle of my songs and podcasts. And there's some kind of weird glitch where when you press play, it'll start playing the song. But you can't pause it, skip to the next song, or even see what song is playing. I don't know what happened but this app is barely usable at this point.",1
Easy to use and fast,5
I get my fix whenever I need it. IM ADDICTED! It's a great addiction. Please don't leave me. Sounds like a red flag I know. Thanks Spotify. 😃,5
Iam unable to open spotify it is always stuck with its symbol and black screen when i open the app😭,1
man when in phone i can't play the song i like form the playlist sometimes it adds unwanted songs,3
I loveeeee itttttt....but ads just spoil d mood!!,5
Offers very good selection of my favoured music,5
Its really good for your mind. Because music is a drug and Hip Hop is my drug dealer....,5
Spotify has great music! Still learning how to use it though... I can honestly say that it's better than YouTube.,5
The now playing part doesn't show up so I can't compile a playlist,2
"The apps sound quality is very nice and I appreciate it but sometimes the songs stop playing and I have to play it again and again, the ads are the most important part like I know that I don't have a premium pack but it does not mean that there will be ad after every song and not one but two aur three, that's very annoying and irritating. Please fix it 🙏",3
The best music library,5
"Excellent! Does all it promises, and more.",5
The Android wrapper is garbage. Extremely glitchy from time to time even though my updates are turned on. Main issue is that I cannot see what song/podcast is playing (so now I am stuck at 1.5 x speed on Stevie Wonder--a setting I used for listening to podcasts).,3
Best music app on the play store,5
Perfect music app 🙏❤️,5
Best education for all ages. Music has become an essential aspect for all of our lives in the future as well as the past.,5
Great App ( can be lagy),5
"Whenever i skip a song, it goes hidden. Why? Just because i didnt want to listen to that song then, or i accidentally skipped it, i cant listen to it? And removing it from hidden is hard too. It doesnt work most of the time. I tapped a hidden song hundreds of times to get it unhiden, but that only worked twice. If i want to make it hidden, give me the option to do so, dont make it mandatory to skip the song. And i cant link to google account. I have just lost everything because of that. 0/10bad",1
App does not seem to work on Samsung Galaxy A50! Cannot search for music. App crashes if I attempt to add a song to a Playlist and cannot see Playlist after adding songs on the web. No option appears to play songs either. I have deleted and reinstalled the app several times and have logged out and back in several times. I have done everything that I know to reduce background apps running and ensure wifi signal strength. Simply put your app is not compatible with my phone.,1
This good and bad I can't skip only 6 time each days and I don't even have back skips pls delete that pls,4
Great music but after a while the music started cutting out and it had been cutting out every few seconds and if I didn't turn my screen back on it would keep cutting out so I uninstalled and reinstalled it and now nothing loads. I have been using spotify for about 4-5 years now and nothing has happened but now it won't load at all.,1
Fantastic comprehensive range of music,5
Amazing plain and simple,5
Too much ads,1
This is the best music player I have ever had Spotify has all the song you like you can put them in your liked category and you you have daily mixes that you will enjoy that's why I love using Spotify 5 stars.,5
Love the app! But one thing is i dont like the fact that the same ad repeats telling us to get spotify premium. Other then that i HIGHLY reccomend,4
Gives you ads a lot and you get like 10 30 seconds ads in a row,1
"Total fun, easy.",5
"Just got started with Spotify, but so far it is very user-friendly and has a great variety artists.",5
Wonderful application. No issues so far,5
Some of the popular music I listen or I can understand and sing or use for enterprise and faith are in Spotify I do not listen to most music yet because of my culture and religion which writes that music is the opium and doping of non-believing atheists and azazel,5
Everytime I install the app it opens it but it won't go to the log in page it only stays on the Spotify logo and it just stays there I've tried to install and uninstall the app but it doesn't work. And even tryed to restart my phone and check my data and it still doesn't work.,2
I can't believe I pay £10 a month for this and you still block the whole screen on startup with ads asking to refer a friend.,1
Very good selection of songs,5
Nah you guys are bad I went to play some of my liked songs and it gave me something else songs I don't even know. I just wanna listen to my favorite song.,1
I have a free account but I just got charged $9.99.,1
"The app has been fine for me ever since I downloaded it (probably 2 years ago), but since 2 days ago it hasn't been working for me at all. Only opens with the logo showing up in the middle of a black screen, then never responding after. Tried all the things I could in reddit and guides online, same result. Uninstalled multiple times and reinstalled only to be met with the same exact result. Tried deleting cache and data, still the same thing. Hope my app gets fixed :(",2
Best digital music library available,4
Spotify rules. It's so dam good!,5
App contacts Spotify and shows preferences but doesn't provide Playlist when you click on selected items.,1
"I am fully satisfied with the musics heard during my work, actually not listening to the words but encouraged with the rhythm for continuing my work.....",5
If you guys can make it so I can play music from the widget and not having the app run in the background that would be awesome,4
"I cant play the songs i want but instead, its playing other songs. It was ok before but now i cannot play sons i want",2
Enjoy the choices I have with Spotify,4
probably the best music app out there but I've just got one tiny problem... i wish we could rearrange songs in our Playlist. we can do that in our queued songs but not in playlists. atleast let us rearrange in the playlist that we've made ourselves.,5
It was fine before update but after the update I can't pick the songs I want to play on the playlist I made to listen to Please fix it!!,2
Good app but still some songs should be there I like BTS still with you song and many more English and Hindi so 😶,3
Easy to use and versitile!,5
Best companion for Road trip 😃 Awesome quality of sound and recommendations of playlists are likewise,5
Great! I used to have qq music (the Chinese version of Spotify) and im trilingual plus an opera lover so I miss being able to have translation of foreign languages. Spotify only offers English lyrics for English songs. Translations of lyrics into english. That's the only feature I would suggest.,4
"No adds, loads quickly, and all the music I like!",5
Love Spotify listen to it all the time,5
"Ui updated now it's like the rows but each row has 1 item in it like , if your gonna make it scroll down instead of across can you at least make the size of the album art fit",5
Great service terrible annoying pestering adds and emails I got four emails in one day about the same promotion. I've unsubscribed from the email but the point is that it's shameless and shouldn't happen. At this point I'd rather go back to YouTube adds than deal with this over the top in your face self promotion. Good job losing a customer spotify.,1
"Can add ""rewind and forward 10 sec"" opt. as I like to hear some specific line in the music and it is difficult to adjust it by that music track line.",5
"Seems to use up a lot of processing, cause audio to cut out when using Bluetooth earbuds. Other music players work fine.",1
Play random song that I don't want like even look for the right song no random song so one star,1
Excellent app I can listen every music in any language,5
the app is not opening even after reinstalling for several times. Tried to contact via email no response. All it shows is the logo and nothing else,1
"Someone hacked my account and changed my DOB and now I can't change it back. Also, there aren't random genre Playlist. Only what someone has created.",1
The now playing bar is gone. The app is now useless,2
It's annoying like when ever I'm doing my play list it comes up with random songs that I don't like 😐 andit evens makes me so frustrated with this app I did it as a 1 star because it doesn't play Ur song it plays something else.,1
Fix your stupid app. It's been crashing for months now,1
Brilliant love the podcasts and the access to music,5
"THIS IS A GOOD APP ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKES MUSIC !! (man i can't really function well without spotify honestly) The only problem is, why can't I subscribe to a premium plan using smart courier? As a student, that's the only way I can pay for premium. It only says ""oops, something went wrong, please try again."" which happened to me lots of times. The GETPIN method used to work really well but now I can't get a pin. What to do? Or are you able to fix this? :(",5
It's a wonderful app love it ..no problem at all ..and it's really nice coz you have all sorts of different genres of music 🎶 to choose from so yeah well done 👍 Spotify.. great app and I will also recommend it to my family and friends 💓.cheers mate,5
Very helpful if finding new music and genre's and it let's me feel somewhat of a personalized selection when finding music,5
"Very annoying app for the Android version. Yes, I am using the free version, but it does not mean I cannot back track a playlist, only giving forward/next track option. Cruel thing you have got. I still prefer the PC version. And if you like get the Windows version spoilt too.",1
Good app I like the way it gives the freedom of choosing your own artists,5
Am enjoying this app Spotify l get all the music l want and it's very less on data usage,5
The worst app ever... Was working fine for a few but now I can't even login and i used to use this app for studying but now as i can't even login it's becoming awful.... Spotify please as soon as possible resolve this issue... I like this app. I mean i love it but now i am disappointed... Please solve i want to study happily.... Please please please 🥺,1
Downloaded the app but it is not opening.,2
Amazing app! And it gets even better when you get the premium!,5
"Love it. On demand, can download papists for when offline, Blend playlists with family /friends",5
I just facing a issue When we play a playlist when 1st song ends it play something totally different song that song not in a playlist also I am disappointed by this 😕,1
"I love this app, it's great, I get to listen to crisp, high quality music. HOWEVER, Spotify mobile is almost straight irritating to use. I understand you guys need to make money, but not letting me even get to pick the song, and only letting me use 6 skips an hour??? Or how about when I make a new playlist for my alarm, I choose several songs I liked, only to wake up to a song I DID NOT put on the playlist? Is that a glitch, or an incredible inconvenience to the user?",3
"Regardless if you use free edition or buy premium, you will ALWAYS get ads. Will upgrade score when Spotify fixes this but I don't see it happening as Ive used Spotify premium for years",2
"I think it's an awesome app, but I would like it if android phone users could see there play list and not snopets of songs",4
Perfect place to find music,5
"Most recent update is the worst yet. Extreme lag, constantly having to restart the app, and the new Library feature is 10 steps back from the previous UI. Please address these issues or I will no longer be paying for this service.",5
This app is good very nice songs and ad free I love this app very much ❤ 😍 😄 😀 👏,3
"I would appreciate if you can put the heart to select liked songs, on the lock screen bar. When I drive and find a cool song, it is safer to have it available on my lock screen than to unlock my phone and try and open the app. Deezer has it and would really love you guys to do it, too?!",3
We really need a feature to hide censored songs. It might come as a surprise to you but most of the users are adult and will not die of a heartattack if they hear a swear word in a song. However we get annoyed when we hear our favorite songs edited out,1
I love how when you put in a certain artist it gives you a list of songs in the same genre. Really makes it easier to look up songs and hear new ones you've never heard before 😎👍👍,5
Why the hell can't you play selective music or stop random music being added to playlists that are related to anything never thought I'd say SoundCloud is better,1
"Hi, so when i play any songs and randomly a song pop-up a different song, so i was like WHAT THE HECC IS WRONG WITH SPOTIFY, so yea i gave you a bad review",1
"Mobile app sucks, I can't select a specific song on one of my Playlist. It plays recommended, ok right like I crafted a Playlist of sea shanties so I could listen to ""Misty Mountians"" from LOTR, $%×$ off",1
My Spotify is not working for more than 2 weeks . When I am going to any playlist it's say the playlist Is empty and in the liked songs section it's saying something is wrong,1
I've used Spotify for years and it's the best.,5
Fabulous love listening to all the oldies,5
Saved my ride experience on a long trip.,5
I love this app because this app was very useful to relax and enjoy the rest of the day,5
"The app keeps having an error where it doesn't show what's playing, which means you can rewind, fast forward or pause. SO ANNOYING!!",1
Best app for songs 😇😇,5
"Great service, terrible app. Half complete tablet interface, random crashes, and overall just buggy.",3
"Very wide selection, incredible",5
Superb quality & fabulous list of songs I'm thankful to your team.,5
I want to be able to scroll down my playlist but I can't anymore,4
"Good content, less advertising",5
I love this app but the only problem is that ads.I like that they have lyrics in songs. Although it's a good app.,4
Nice app. It would be great if it would be possible to see the music lyrics in the TV when I cast using the Google Chromecast for example.,4
"Been using Spotify for a few years now, but I switched to a new phone and now it's not letting me use my account and having me use a new account.",4
The best at this music streaming platform,5
"Phone remote to tablet to stereo(s), excellent programming. Excellent entertainment. Spotify is so good you just might quit watching tv...Fantastic playlist generator, and perfect operation with only 2G of freespace. And You, You will have fun-guaranteed-and thats just the free version. Home cache clear.",5
Great sound quality!!,5
It was terrible and not a pleaseant experinece. The music sucns and couldnt find the crazy frog remix of all time............,1
Don't know why i can't use the app anymore. The screen always stuck at the logo,2
For the past month I've had to either clear the clutter or clear what's been saved or delete and install again more than I can count I love the music on Spotify but every time I'm listening to something and it skips it and the settings aren't off I mean every now and then it just works fine but then after a while it starts skipping again or it starts changing when I'm not ready to change the music I don't know if this is a system error I downloaded every possible update ???????? Thank you,1
It it too good music app during travel time .It shows rarely ads and gives good sound and many more functiona ..I loved it ..I used to enjoy very much this app ...thanks and good luck Spotify team..,5
They updated it to where I can't use my favorites playlist or any playlist and to the point where I can't listen to any song I'd like to listen to. I am highly disappointed in this.,1
Spotify is a good app overall but the only problem for me is when I try to change to another song it just loads and plays a short part of the song and then plays another song which I do not like.,4
I love now being alone because my god and Spotify is with me ..,5
Wow I love the app It's great I pray it won't change,4
"I have very eclectic musical tastes and Spotify connects me to music I love from all genres and eras. It has also been a wonderful way for me to connect musically with my son as we expand each other's musical universe. I find it also has more content in my favorite genres such as old reggae, than the other leading service. I joined Spotify a few years ago and it has improved my life in so many great ways.",5
"Honestly I didn't start truly enjoying Spotify until I started using the Student plan for Premium, but it's worth it. Easy listening, easy playlist organization, good quality music.",5
I always enjoy the music,5
Annoying... can't turn off notifications,1
"There is a problem that in notifications, album art of a different song is shown when music is playing.",4
There's some adds but it's usually fine,5
Unable to open the app,1
We need a spotify light mode and canvas option for premium users,3
I have paid 7rs for one day just to check the app...it did not activated at all...,1
All and different music..love it!,5
The quality is good but song suggestion is worst part of this app,2
LOVE ❤️ my ONLY app for music and podcasts!,5
Bro you have to pay to skip songs and you only get six. I think am going to YouTube now spotify is bullshiz,1
"Used to be my go to music app. I used to hold it as the standard. Now the music recommendations suck, the premium features are no longer worth paying for, and the lite version is sub par compared to other music apps out there...so after 7 years, I'm saying sayonara.",1
"It's almost perfect, but there are some things that make me rage, an example is when you play a music/playlist and turn off your phone, the music will keep playing just 2 sometimes and then stop the music instead to keep going. Doesn't matter whatever you do it's always happen, even if you set up to play the music in loop. I think that is just happen to me, although, the rest is perfect.",4
"Something is going wrong. The app want wiring yesterday. It'll start playing songs then stop and not restart. So I closed Theo app and relaunched it and it'd just stop again. So I made sure it was updated, cleared data and cache, then I uninstalled and re-installed and now it will not even open.",1
"A very good app , recommended to all my friends",5
Very good all the music you want,5
This app is the absolute worst. Why pay for premium and your user cant even access music from the app without it crashing daily or freezing altogether?,1
Songs are streaming but when trying to search song getting no internet connection message,1
"My app doesn't work. I updated the application many days ago, and I just receive a message like this: ""Something went wrong Check your Internet connection and try again"". This is disappointing.",3
Amazing music app,5
"Using a Samsung Galaxy A10. App stopped working after a recent software update - all playlists are empty or I get the message ""Oops, something went wrong"". Hope this gets resolved soon.",1
Great app for streaming. Except randomly stops playing and I have to push the play button to get it going again.,4
this app is not good because it keeps shuffling songs i just want to hear one song not playlist it should take away the shuffle like if you want it shuffled then do it on your playlist,1
"Not working.. Clear the catch, clean data.. Everything ll be try to open.... Nw what can do, iz working probably...???",2
"Spotify was my fav app till the updated it now it sucks i hate the new update you just can't turn off the shuffle button it's not even showing it now and it makes me soo mad all i want to say is,You have ruined spotify and everyone's saying the same thing you better fix this issue",1
"Its good, i don't get ads without purchasing the subscription . I've used it for like 5 months its working perfectly. I find all the songs that i want from acroos the world. Keep up the good work :)",5
"Love it , though would love more old stuff too",5
Outstanding music streaming. Even obscure music can be found. Rarely issues and when they occur they are fixed quickly.,5
Smooth experience only challenge is not able to identify original or remix,5
"Buggy mess. Don't use if you want to listen to podcasts. No player until you open the app back up and a lot of the time it's missing. I have to close the app and reopen just to find the pause button. Also it's way too sensitive and often accidentally skip the episode by the slightest ""swipe"" and often shows finished when I go back which is infuriating when the podcast is hours long. BRING US A PLAYER!",1
I enjoy listening to my music when I want I also like how I can adjust the next song to come in as the other song is almost over,5
So good but only if u have spotify primuim,5
Because I could not listen to the songs that I saved,3
Soo trash wayy to many ads I don't want premium but too much ads,1
Very Op songs and very good,5
It is a really good streaming service to listen to any song that you can for free. But the function to filter the liked playlist isn't working. I don't know why as this is a useful feature. I'm not sure if this is the same for everyone else though. But other than that it is possibly the best music streaming service there is.,4
Please come up with light mode feature 🐱,4
Because of I listen all bts song in Spotify,5
"In the latest update they adopted pandora's 'you must have premium to have a nonshuffled playlist' and everything is now a radio station making playlists redundant unless you're premium. Honestly I'd rather use youtube, soundcloud, or my old tablet that can still play nonshuffled songs. Or the spotify web player cause it's only mobile that's suffering this Also too many ads not enough ad breaks. And they can string 15 ads together, crash the device, and make you listen to 5 more.",1
"Started as an almost 5/5 app. But then product managers started to ""improve"" the product and with each upgrade the product is less usable for me. It's more about what they want you to listen to instead of what you want to listen to. Offline songs get deleted on a regular basis so you have to re-download them again and again. Last time I learned that on an airplane...",2
The app is good but at times it stops playing all of a sudden,5
Amazing experience just perfer yt music better,4
"It is a good app, with most songs I have looked for are available, but recently my liked songs are not showing when I log into Spotify on my laptop, and I have restarted the app, and reinstalled it several times, but I still can't see my liked songs, so not sure why this is happening 😢",4
Sound quality is perfect but too many ads without premium subscription which is disgusting. That's it.,4
"I listen to music many hours every day. Spotify has such a great variety of music. I love their custom daily playlists. I find music I find music I haven't heard in years in them, fantastic.",5
Super music player i enjoy it,5
"Very nice, BTW check out my epic Playlist ""nice songs""",4
Easy to use and great selections,5
My app is not opening ..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................,2
"After the update I cannot play the music I want it just keep playing the song that are suggested and not on my playlist,please remove this feature it ruins the whole app.",2
"Was awesome until I opened it today and couldn't have songs play on laps, not bring able to play songs by themselves. And more..",3
1year yusing dis app dis in nice song,5
"I remember when I first started with spotify it's use to be good, then the price went up and my playlists went down simple mean other things will follow, I will watch and see",3
I've had Spotify premium since 2017 and it's never failed to provide the right tunes when nessecary. Never need wifi to play a song. Spotify is the BEST!!!,5
"DO NOT USE SPOTIFY if you intend to store music offline to an external storage card. There is a massive issue with the app not recognizing the card after a restart and trying to re-download all your offline music to internal storage creating multiple locations in the process. It's only been an issue for about 7 years so the developers clearly haven't got a clue how to resolve it, they just palm to off with the usual reinstall advice WHICH DOESN'T WORK.",1
"Worst app I pay for. I have to delete it and re-install at least 3 to 4 times a week. It either stops playing after 10 minutes or won't stop playing. I have to open the phone and close the app. Then it starts playing when I get back in the car and won't stop when I get out of the car. I have to open the phone, open the app and delete the app.",1
"And again - Nothing has changed! Original post🤦‍♂️- The App now: Stops every 10 minutes. Carrys on playing & cannot be shut down. Does not upload. Yes, I've uninstalled. The latest update is poor, I have no idea how the UX or QA cycle ever got signed off. Downloaded content will not play when you move onto another episode. Cuts out. UI looks crowded and not smooth at all. Paying premium for a product that does not work properly. Acknowledge & own the faults Spotify, then fix! Thanks",1
It's a very good app! It doesn't shows ads very often..i can skip or play many songs and then the ad may play but not always.,5
Never ending music pleasure,5
"Spotify is an audio content access platform. Mostly, that works well. However, there seem to always be issues with the basics while new features get rolled out that are really not necessary, and sometimes even unclear. For example, on a flaky network connection, I cannot access my downloaded/offline content. That obviously defeats the purpose. Another one was that, on a flaky network, a podcast kept pausing and resuming a half-second, contentwise, later. @Spotify Please focus on solid basics!!!",3
At first it was grt but now It's not at all working like before. I select a song but it plays another,1
"You basically can't use it without premium at all. Also bugs and It shows I'm offline despite playing music from my own playlists just fine, but I can't search for music. Unusable mess pushing weird stuff on me when it does see the Internet connection. Unless you pay and build your own playlists, knowing exactly what you want to listen to yourself I'd never recommend. It's for people that love music itd for average person what doesn't know what to listen to and can get manipulated by algorithm",1
Spotify is really good And with it lyrics when playing music,5
Man Spotify's the 🐐. Great to know that it has put COVID warning in the appropriate episodes of Joe Rogan Podcast. ( ͝° ͜ʖ͡°)ᕤ,5
User friendly and recomends great personalised mixes. I do feel that there should be an option to donate to musicians on free music platforms,3
Amazing bro but lessen the adds to like every ten songs instead of two💀,5
Too many ads,1
Great music any music u like to hear,5
Ads are disturbing,4
"It's amazing to be able to find and listen to songs you haven't heard in ages and the recommendations lead you to bands you forgot about ! Thanks 😊. Update 7-21-22 it's still worth the payment. I've favored many songs from their suggestions, you asked me to rate again and I see why. You're awesome Spotify !",5
Great app but Spotify can't play some song and please add song in Spotify some song are not in Spotify,3
No change to my Spotify app. Funny how it doesn't work for me on my Android yet my wife and sons have no problems with their phones? Maybe it is because I openly criticize the Bozo some people elected to be president and the fact police are bold as ever? Spotify I'll be closing you out and you will get no more money from me. Let's Go Brandon !,1
Good music but I can't stream music through data so only downloaded music while on the road :(( didn't have that the past couple years,2
This app is great as it makes play lists depending on what you've listened to before and generally puts together a good list for you to listen to.,5
I love the playlists and the wide variety of songs and podcasts,5
Outstanding application..this app can cunsume a little data. It has an advertise in m7CH quantity..,5
If I can't change the theme of my lyrics at least give me nice themes because your current themes are very boring,2
You can find any track you want brilliant app.,5
Trash login system. ... Whenever i try logging into some other device through my mobile number...the OTP never arrives. 😠 . . . STOP BEGGING FOR PREMIUM.,1
My only and favorite app for music. I pay for premium to skip all the commercials but enjoy the fact you can follow friends playlists and make multiple playlists of your own in the library. Best music app thus far. 💚,5
"The best online Music app ever !! The quality of music, collection of songs, non-premium service quality & value-for-money premium plans... There's no match to Spotify !! Note: This review after 1 year of non-premium usage, 1 month of premium usage of Spotify & using umpteen number of other premium & non-premium online Music apps including prime music for the last 1 year.",4
I just love Spotifyyyyyyy!!!!,5
I do not recommend this. It keeps playing extra songs and not the ones I want. I hate this,1
Well i dont have a prob is that when i try to listen to music it gives me 1 or 2 ads and then says i have 30min of no ad but only last 10min and also now it gives me 8 or 9 ads,1
Very Good Music Quality 😊,5
why do you keep updating it ffs your making it worse! if it aint broke dont fix it whoever makes the updates for this sack them on the spot hes a retard.,1
"The best, deleted other streaming app when I found out about Spotify. So perfect",5
Just the best app to listen to music.,5
"Spotify is great I love it, mainly because I listen to music 24/7 but my main problem with the app is the fact that it barely ever plays the songs on my Playlist, it just play suggested songs before it even thinks about the songs that I actually want to listen to. This even happens when I play my liked songs.",3
"The experience is out of thi world,just wonderful !",4
Fabulous and entertaining really appreciated. Thank you 😊,5
Very good play list,5
A good music streaming app,5
"I like Spotify even more now that there's lyrics to the songs. I also like Spotify because I can leave the app, do other things on my phone and still be able to listen to the music.",5
Brilliant ap - have the paid for version. The free one is difficult to use as the songs don't play in order. But the paid for ap is fantastic.,5
Easy app to use and enjoy,5
"Recently spotify hasn't been letting me listen to songs and says that all playlists that I click on are empty (even random ones) whenever I click on my library it's empty even tho I know I havent deleted any of my playlists, whenever I go to my own profile they are all there though and it's getting really annoying since this is a streaming app that I love",1
when karaoke feature available?,4
Fine app if you want to pay for the service and I try to listen without premium service and you got to go through 10 ads before playing and you can only listen to your list as they play it and if you skip you only get 6 skips per hour to listen to your own song list. Wasn't this way when I started this app about a month ago... It's a shame,1
Exceptional.. 4 stars just coz of the annoying ads in free version,4
"I am ""guaranteed 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" after listening to 4 advertisements. Two (3 minute) songs later, I get two more advertisements. At least be honest and just tell me that I'm going to get ads every couple of songs.",3
Spotify you need to fix your app ok? I was literally listening to in the middle of the night and boom it plays a random song so plss Spotify bring back the repeat ft because I love this app and it can be improved but I think your just doing this so more people purchase premium.this is a money grab I can just purchase premium but I have more thing to deal with so pls Spotify bring back the repeat ft,2
Great App. All Songs available at a single click.Amazing.,5
Lot's of ad's,3
Best music app on the planet,5
Toooo many ads,3
It's great yada yada... Please add a true shuffle that is equally random between every song as the already existing one is rigged,4
"The best music app EVER, I got everything I need in just one app",5
I love Spotify but it's always makes difficult to listen and I really hate that and there's always bags,2
"Got a free 2 month premium trial from a friend and started getting ads after one month. Also, sound quality is inferior to Pandora.",2
"After every song I would get about 3-4 ads. Features are very limited, limited skips, shuffle only overall a really bad app. I would reccomend only using the desktop version but ads are really incessant there too.",1
It's much better than ganna app. J m really enjoying it,3
"Great app the ads are not bad at all,I love it 🥺❤️🤞so boring that you have to pay before you can download any songs 💔😓😭",5
I love the content....but this app continually crashes. The podcast keeps playing but there is no way to stop it without closing the app completely. Been this way for months.,1
"This may be a good app until I wanted to play a song, a specific one to say. But it always shows a ""suggested"" song that I dont want and I cant even stand it anymore so please fix this cause all we want is some music.",1
I can renew my payment on this app with my Nigeria card and it annoying 😒,1
"Can't even choose a song. If you select a specific song, the app will choose some other song for you.",1
The mobile version of Spotify is currently unusable on my device. There isn't a way to play individual songs from a playlist or an album. The only upside is that podcasts work as expected.,2
Doctor who and soundtracks mostly also I hop it free so far,5
when it says free premium for a month it should mean free premium for a month not sign up for spotify premium that doesnt make sense and u shouldn't have to wait for skips and u need to remove songs we added i hate the songs you added,1
Downloading a playlist only means you'll have the first 10 seconds of each song. Embarrassing. I switched to this after Google got rid of Google music. I guess nothing good exists anymore.,1
Best music/podcast app ever,5
Damn i hate spotify!! When i want to click my favourite it turns out a different song!!! UGH I GONNA UNINSTALL THIS APP SERIOUSLY MAKE ME ANGRY😡🙄,1
Best music app out there! Joe Rogan for life!!,5
Was logged out out of nowhere and now im stuck in login page tried every troubleshooting steps in their website but to no avail. My brother has the same phone make and model but his Spotify is working fine.,1
The app is very good but there are to many adds,4
Excellent sound quality,5
It's very nice application 😊 I enjoy songs with lyrics ☺️💜,4
This app is so good like you can make a blend with your favourite artist and bands,5
"According to me this app is good but after a year of using it i find a problem of using it ,as it always says that I'm offline even when I'm online.",3
"Occasional bugs here and there. Sometimes they fix them, sometimes they don't. At least not right away. Also bummed that, and I understand for legal reasons, there are some bands/albums/musicians that are not available.",3
"That last couple update have systematically broken the app. Connections to devices are buggy and intermittent. UI has broken a dozen times a day and won't respond, play anything, and when it does the wrong item will show as playing versus the sound. Can't skip what it doesn't know it's playing!.. Reinstall and restarts are no help. ""No internet connection"" even when I am on the god damn wifi and in a city. Straight up broken at the moment.",4
please stop addding song that are not in my playlist. Its so annoying to listen to a song not on your playlist when you want to listen to YOUR playlist not what Spotify wants. I wish there was a option i tried everything and Nothing worked so PLEASE make it an option!,3
Brings me back to the olden days Junior High High School good music love it😎😊,5
"I lost all of my Playlists and I can't figure out how to retrieve them. My everyday phone has my music but my phone that just have Spotify, no music. But both phone are on the same account.",1
The best in the universe speaking of music listening..,5
Probably the most frustrating app in the store. Crashes often. Many features just don't work. (like add to queue doesn't even work) I'm a paid subscriber and quite disappointed.,1
Great App Stream Music and Listen Offline,5
I can listen to all music using I play games I love that facility,4
Constantly says I have no internet connection when I do,1
"Took 3 payments from my account in 1 month , when I contacted them theysaid they couldn't refund me and I could cancel the app if I wished to do so and left it at that.... ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"After new update, i can't press lyric anymore to go to certain part of music. I hope u fix it back because that's the main reason I stick to Spotify beside deep integration with my Samsung phone.",4
"You can't find out if the song you searched up is the one you want cause when you select it it plays literally any song, but the song you asked for",1
"Best app in world!!! No issues with ads (comes only sometimes), network problem (never ever if you are having broadband) and song volume or quality... I love this app😍😍😍",5
Too much pub,4
Not sure how spotify manages to be a 7 billion dollar company and also an app that literally doesn't work half the time but I can't find an app like it so here we are,1
"No ads, just music",5
Best music player ever,5
"Overall, I pay the $10 a month because I appreciate what the app provides. However, for $10 a month, it's a little irritating that the offline mode sometimes acts up and even though things are downloaded, the app can't access them.",4
i cannot live without Spotify.,5
"This app is great, it has (almost) every song I really enjoy. Def a 5 star rating",5
Great app to listen bts song,5
"You have taken down so many albums and songs, offline mode is horribly slow. I am switching to YouTube music. I wish I had done this sooner.",1
Overall fantastic service their library of genres is phenomenal,5
Takes a lot of time to load sometimes,4
It just a good app in general but there are too many premium restrictions,4
Too much ads now a days. So uninstalling the app.,2
There so much ads after every single songs,2
LIVE Spotify!!! I refuse to use any other music app. XOXO,5
"It's not Spotify It's adsify. Ads will come even after you heard a single song, Full of ads, that is of 30sec..... Worst experience ever 🤧",1
Good app for listening music but one problem creates that is sometimes you chose another music to listen in between ads are disturbing to you 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔.....,5
"I give premium a 5 but the free version is kinda bad, They make you listen to a certain amount of songs then you have to wait to be able choose what song you want to listen to.",5
Unexplainable. I'm extremely happy eith Spotify ever since i been introduced to it last year by a friend. I'm rating 5 🌟's,5
Really like having limited ad's and they don't take up the whole screen.,5
Good just long ads and to much ads I'll skip probably 1 so ng and I'll get about 3 to 4 ads,3
I love Spotify just Awesome ❤️,5
Worst app i have ever used. When you try to login it shows that it has an issue try later and not even twice or thrice but always. Please Spotify either look after this or you will have trouble later.,1
"I like it and although many people are complaining it works just fine the playlist will be ""blocked"" sometimes on some devices because of updates but if you make sure it is updated it is fine.",4
Really good app for music lovers,4
Amazing app with premium,5
Wide array of beautiful music. Thank you,5
Solid. Very enjoyable.,5
"I love spotify, I've been using this app for years. There are a few things that could be fixed like after it plays a billion ads it will say ""you have 30 minutes of ad free music"" but then I get an ad right after that song so.",4
Very nice music application,5
I find my old tunes on Google and your right there to add awsome,5
I love it I find all my fave music n new songs that come out I like that if u buy subscription u don't have any commercial,5
"First the users were entitled to get 30mins of uninterrupted ad free music , and now u play a song u will find a ad .Just Fed up with them .",1
The user experience is amazing.,5
I love having the music of the world under my fingers.,5
Toooooo many ads for premium. Seems truly irritating,2
Great app tons of music,5
Great app. Good connectivity,5
"Perfect -- extremely well designed, seamless across all my devices, fast/responsive, simple interface. Kudos to the development team and UI designers.",5
I've changed my mind and they have improved this app.,5
Excellent app. Very rarely is a song choice not available.,5
Wish I could arrainge order of favorite songs on playlist,4
Can't listen offline. There used to be a download option. Now it is not available anymore.,3
"As always great app, what would we do without Spotify.",5
I give this app a 1 because there is a problem i always click on a song and put another it is so bad,1
I enjoyed this app the first week I listened the songs on it,5
"Hi,I love this app but when I play my playlist it as songs I didn't put on it also can you add a loop button I hate that I can't hear my favorite song over and over again I'm sorry if I'm sounding mean but I just want a loop button and not listen to songs that I did add to my playlist please that's all.",4
The Thunderstorm Podcast is what it is because of Spotify!! Anchor you're awesome!!!!,5
Deleted. Started auto playing weird stuff. Turned off all auto play buttons but clearly not enough. There are better apps,1
Super and nice songs to enjoy music,5
Paid for the premium and enjoy the ease of use with no ads. Would give it 5 stars if the free version didn't have so many ads and you could select the song you want on your playlist rather than having to listen to it on random.,4
"Not only does Spotify glitch, it also shuts down all apps 😐 even if I'm only running one app 😐 now I have to cancel my subscription because I can't use it as it's only connected to Spotify. But wait, I tried Spotify Lite so that I didn't waste my subscription.. same thing, just worse. Not even latest version works. More Bug Fixes Needed -Don't subscribe- How come there are ads in the podcast episodes when I've bought premium to avoid ads? Doesn't make much sense.",1
"the ""we added"" feature thing is useless every single time you make a playlist with one song they just add more so you get less ""bored"" or stuff idk bruh this app is good but I wouldn't recommend making your own playlist",4
This app has great sound quality and easy to use,5
When I entered my Spotify my account all missed up and no longer showing or allowing me to access the Playlists I made or any artists and my favorite music's. Poor service 😡,1
It's definitely a good but a little problem it's has only a little skips even thought you have premium and when i make my playlist the song is short,4
It's pretty good but when your a free listener u get limited skips and u can't stay in the same Playlist like for example if I'm listing to boy with uke three songs later I get a whole new different song so can u please fix this?,4
"So many ad disturbances kindly without premium, suggestion take the all problem seriously..thanks..",2
Kept pausing for no reason so i tried to uninstall and then reinstall. Now the app won't open past the spotify logo. I have been a premium subscriber for years but now if this doesn't start working soon I'll have to try a different service. Very disappointing.,1
Spotify is so cool,5
This is the best app to listen to music and release you stress ❤🧡💛💚 I would use this app 24/7💯,5
Such a best music experience but there are lots of ads,4
I'm changing my review frome 5✨ to 3✨ just because they removed eisenfunks song called PONG,3
I love that I can make my own playlists and I also enjoy those created for me. Have found some new bands!,5
As a consumer an a artist Spotify been good with innovation on algorithms. Pay could be better but they put my song in front of different audiences who now follow everywhere,5
"Was reading some reviews and im quite disapointed, so many complains about skiping or ads or songs added to a playlist, please upgrade to premium. The COMPANY and the ARTISTS are not making any money from free accounts, and then you hear most complains from these individuals, if you cant afford it yet pls dont give 1 to 2 stars to an app that you are freeloading from. Our plan is spot family, P214($3.8) for 6 fam members, that is P36 ea person/ month. Doesnt even dent ur monthly income friends",5
I like spotify it is good . Pls put new songs on it .,5
I love that app but there is stuff like stupid stuff that you need vip and I don't want to pay to do this little things,4
"Great price for a great service. Love, love, love",5
Good song picks but hope the sound quality will be at par with Tidal in the future nevertheless sound quality is good. It also lacks EQ to make songs a bit of your personal tuning.,4
Good selection of music and artist,4
Best music experience!!!,5
Love it . There when I'm In need of a familiar sound to match my mood,5
That's so cool kinda app but its little bit weird ❤,5
Awesome I love the music sound,5
"Really good app, have had it for 5 years and has always been great. I listen to everything, sometimes Lags a bit but I think it's just down to the amount of tunes I have",5
"I get to hear two songs, and then get 3 ads in a row, then I might be able to listen to 5 songs, but then get 4 ads in a row. When I first started using this app, I thought it was okay, but now all I seem to hear are ads, and suggested songs that I didn't add to any of my playlists. And why are they trying to get me to listen to country? I'm not a fan of that genre, but when I click the minus botton it plays 3 ads in a row. I know I'm one person, but this is really frustrating.",1
"If I pay for an ad free experience, I expect my content to be ad free. Spotify double-dipping and forcing me to listen to ads on podcasts, even though I pay for a premium subscription, is a disappointing display of unnecessary greed. That coupled with the fact that downloadable, offline listening is a promised feature that almost NEVER works makes me wonder why I have a subscription in the first place.",1
I can't open spotify. I've reinstalled a lot of time already and nothing.,1
It keeps crashing n turning off.,1
I am using Spotify premium and Podcasts are not working anymore. Big downgrade. Do sth about it and soon.,1
"I had this for 4 years, and the newest update? I can't work it i logged in, everything is ""empty"" and stuff like that. Like??? Please fix it?????",2
"Really irritating that everytime I select one of my playlist it just loads forever or shows a blank screen, forcing me to restart the app.",2
Good audio quality but will sometimes not load downloaded playlists/songs and will only open downloads when data is turned off on my end,3
This app is a better then any other music app.👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾,5
Cannot fault Spotify. 💚,5
It is a great overall experience with Spotify,5
It's ok as an app to listen to music but the update made me review 4 stars,4
This new update sucks. I wish the app was displayed on the notification bar so I could just scroll down and change or pause. It's a hassle to stop 1 app and go into Spotify then go back to original app. It should appear on lock screen as well.,3
I need help!!! My spotify NOT OPEN!!!! PLEASE.,1
Refuses to work on my phone works fine on other devices have tried all steps to get it to work with zero success not good enough for something I pay for.,1
"So much to receive with this app. Brings back so many memories ""even If I forgotten all about it the song remembers when""",5
new update is hot trash. select library and it puts you immediately into your playlists. what happens if i don't use playlists? now you just added an extra step for no purpose. artists are now randomly listed. no alphabetical order. no rhyme or reason. I've downloaded these songs dozens of times and everytime they do another ill conceived update all songs are deleted yet again. albums are a disaster. no organization.,1
Love all the music.... uninterrupted,5
"One word describes spotify, AWESOME!",5
"It's amazing, just bummer that you can't get songs that are only found on YouTube on Spotify but otherwise I like this app a lot",5
"UI glitches sometimes. The screen will get stuck and show the same thing even when I switch the song. Also app totally crashed when trying to move from internal to external storage, so I had to reinstall it",3
Listening to my favorite artists and letting me branch out to find music everyday is the best experience. Always something new and I'm here for it,5
Good service. Far too many bugs and annoying features.,1
Almost no problems unlike YouTube music,4
"Overall a good app for music! I give it 4 stars only because it glitches more than usual since I've actually downloaded the app, but I could give it a 5 star rating!",4
"Spotify rocks. I use premium and it's elite, love it more than Pandora for sure. Spotify makes it easy to listen to what you love and helps you explore! My music has expanded a lot thanks to Spotify. 10/10 would recommend.",5
Really good selection of music,5
I was having a great experience but near a year ago the app shut down so I had to reinstall it . I couldn't login into my ID even though every information was correct . I had to make new account and soon as I made it I was logged off . Now I'm using the Chrome version of it. Hoping the bugs can be fixed!,1
Getting a bit glitchy not letting me skip the songs as a tab I have to go on to the app then it doesn't show me what song I'm listening 2 either,4
Music access is fine but app is extremely buggy and often crashes,2
And everytime i listen to the song it plays then it stops,1
Switched from Live X a year and half ago and also had Apple Music. Spotify is the best.,5
Hey my music don't play right it doesn't play it doesn't pause but when it does the bar at the bottom doesn't show and the bar on my notifications doesn't disappear and another bar on my notification keeps saying Spotify connections ??!!!!!!!!!!🤔😒,5
I already disliked this app on mobile anyway but the experience i am having is souring my thoughts on it more. On console and desktop its awsone! But on mobile you really would use this. I repeatedly try to skip songs i already have hidden on the first place so they shouldnt play anway but they still do. And even if i hide a song i dont like it still plays which annoys me. You are better off using some other app than this on mobile. 0/10 if i could give it that rating.,1
Best music streaming app you can find!,5
"Spotify is my music source. With premium being so affordable, I don't have to listen to any other music platform, cause Spotify does everything possible. You can't find a reason not to put good vibes out there for their music platform. Get all your music needs from Spotify, they understand music. Good Job Spotify.",5
It's all good and amazing and all but why I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is that I wish this app could switch accounts like yea so u could just change the acc like if there are 3 ppl and yea they don't have another device so i wish u could've just make accounts switch so yea I wish u could do that and yea otherwise 5/5 but pls make this happen 😉,4
The app is great but now it is hard to find the song that I listen to more over all I love it I would have given it a 10/5,4
Cant control phone volume from GW4. Have to come out of Spotify and then load up media controller to control phone volume,2
"The amount you pay for premium is ridiculous, given that you have access to almost every song you want to find and that you can even download it to listen to it while offline.",5
It says no internet connection available even though I am connected . Maybe there is no connection for another entity to manipulate the data packets that the manipulated music is attempting to inject. Just like the rest of the world. I wonder if you are liable for damages to people thought process,1
Spotify is very good,4
"It's nice because even if I don't have the paid for service I can still have music without it open on my screen unlike YouTube which not only wants me to keep my screen on but frequently pesters me if I'm still watching it. Which is very inconvenient for use while doing anything else at the same time, especially if I'm trying to wash dishes...",5
Got pretty much all want in music not without exception though. Still the best there is in my opinion by a long shot.,5
After new update... Only loading screen no song nothing,1
Very annoying that every time I go to click my playlist it just freezes. It's good other then that,3
Throughout the years more and more things are taken away from free Spotify and made premium only. What a greedy app.,1
I can't use anymore my acct prem from abroad..what's happening to you Spotify ..kaloka ka😏,1
Works do hood and plays my favorite music,5
Lots of good sounds for free!,5
I cannot listen to music...whatever I want to listen to says playlist empty.,1
More ads than Hulu and YouTube combined. Going back to the pirates. ☠️,1
It's just music. Who doesn't like music?,5
Music cuts off here and there. This is from a premium subscriber,2
Like the music but it is a pain that spotify auto connects every time I get in the car or on the bike. Even if I was listening to a podcast or some other music streaming service. Probably delete it before the week is out unless I find out how to stop it.,2
"Worst place to listen to podcasts. Do not expect to pick up where you left off cause Spotify can't even get there timestamp right. Very glitchy all of the time and never works the same way twice, GOOD LUCK",2
Stop adding suggested songs I hate it all I want is to listen to a rickroll AND I CANT I HAVE TO LISTEN TO STUPID SONGS fix this OR IM DELETING SPOTIFY FOREVER,2
Easy to find what music you like.,5
Soooo many ads...... quick tip: quit your app when an ad plays and reopen it to no ad. Works well,1
This the most trashiest music app I've ever download dont but anything from this app its useless,1
"Perfect , i want student premium but i can't find my college",5
"Somebody connected to my account with a different email and I had no access to my playlists or account and no help from spotify to rectify the problem, deleted the app...",2
would be neat if this app could show lyrics. and hate tha I've gotta save the whole album when I'm in fact only need one song,4
"Im getting really tired of it getting glitched out on me and constantly having to Uninstall and reinstall it especially when I pay for premium every month. Like come on. Do better. and NOW it's not even loading. it won't let me in. I unstalled and installed twice and still, nothing.",1
"better than Apple music, but it's a bit annoying that it gets you used to premium for the starting month, and then you're stuck with shuffle mode forever unless you purchase premium. other than that 10/10 edit: bro stop giving me three ads! im so done! and two of the ads are back to back the same thing. taking a star back",4
Too many ads and some covers are not there,2
Private sessions option should be permanent or has permanent private session option. And option to hide or remove recommend playlist.,4
You should add a thing where if you like the playlist it likes all the songs for and you should make it give you premium for 1 year and then after that year it removes you from premium. Overall it is amazing.,4
When I got to play a song it brings me to a playlist and I can't just enjoy song that I want to listen to it's annoying that they add random songs to my playlist and I can't skip them,2
Unable to download music and yes I do have a premium account.,1
Fantastic to have all that music to choose from,5
"Really glad I found this, since finding it I have gotten rid of all my other music apps.",5
Works fine but gets glitchy sometimes,3
"I can't add songs from one playlist to another, the app kicks me out sometimes. I have premium.",1
"I love Spotify! I have acsess to all my favorite music 24/7 365. Theres only been one song that they didnt have. I have a huge genre. Like i tell my children, me and Spot be hanging out everyday, everywhere and any time!!❤",5
Best music app with social sharing features,5
"Great to stream just what I want, whenever I want",5
This Stinks! I hate it!!! why even Make a Premium?!! why can't we just enjoy it for Free like the other music Things!! it's Stupid as Flip :/,1
"If I'm listening to a podcast, after playing one episode it will stop and won't load anything. It's no just paused it's just like the whole thing breaks. They always play 'suggested songs' even if I have a playlist with a ton of songs already there. Also, when I pause it, I come back and its playing again.",2
After new update its only 6 shuffle,5
"its great ! a good music app, but the problem is, it has wayy TOO MUCH adds. its really annoying. i also cannot skip to the songs u want to hear, and limited 6 skips an hour. i can only preview songs too. also, sometimes when i'm listening to one of my playlists, random songs pop up, and they aren't even in my playlist. and aren't my type of music.",4
"Great app,if possible please add sleep timer .",5
Alway find the Music I want to Listen to!!!,5
"The app doesn't let you manage your Premium subscription, you literally have to use the browser version. 1/5 stars",1
"It won't work anymore everything I click on it says it's empty, and I've deleted it and reinstalled it, and idk whatelse to do.",1
"This app has so many insperation.it helps me calm down,relax. I love this app sosososososososososososososo much it is amazing ❤️‍🩹✨",5
I would have rated it 5stars but sometimes there are some problems,3
Like this new update sucks! Old SPOTIFY was better! Just give up your dreams I want to play my song,1
"just one problem. i like using my SD card for downloaded songs. everytime i get a phone update or fully turn my phone off, all my downoaded songs move to my phone's internal storage. i want it to stay in my SD card becauss transferring the data takes forever. please do something about this!",4
"Used to be a good app. Now it will pick Playlists I don't even listen to, nor have I ever listened to them. With the free version you will listen to 3 ads before maybe two songs if you're lucky. Going back to Pandora or just sticking with YouTube.",1
"It keeps saying ""You're offline"" when my internet connection says excellent",3
Overall great music i would definitely say this is the best music app.,5
Top one music ..but mention downloading option.,4
"I'm annoyed. I have used Spotify for a while, and it was great up untill maybe a couple weeks ago, because I think I remember updating, and now every two song there are like three ads. I didn't download this app to listen to non stop adverts, I downloaded it to listen to music. I hope the developers can make it so that there are less ads. thanks!",3
All types of songs are available here and no stopper and all. Love it.,5
songs are hidden but only in certain playlists and not in others?? I can't unhide them? what is going on. im a premium member and I know that shouldn't be an issue. updated and reinstalled and still not working,1
I logged out and now it won't work at all,3
Easy app to use and search for your favorite tunes,5
"Without premium subscription, it's not been audible quality. It's not my words but your own as per your new add.",1
I love listening to music and I love this app,5
Ive really liked spotify especially when they finally added tool songs. There my favorite band,5
Excellent but know you cannot shuffle your tunes to many adds,4
l Acknowledge your good the good job on social media...... and keep it up,5
Amazing music service!,5
The song that I want to listen doesn't even play it keeps playing other songs..n spoils my whole mood 😮‍💨 I wish u could sort this prob asap,1
I love spotify's premium version but these days I can't seem to gat premium I hope you could fix the prepaid option for premium because its having a lot of errors. I am really disappointed and annoyed by it.,1
The app is amazing no ads and can hear all the music i like,5
"It always plays the same songs, and making playlists is extremely tedious. If you want to add more than one song by the same artist you have to search for them over and over again after each song added.",2
"So great indeed, every sort of music is available",5
This is the best app for music 😊😊😊😉,4
"All I wanted to say is this app has features that blow ""Pandora"" out of the water! Great library of selections to choose from! 👍",5
Great for news and life encounters,5
Love the selection and genres,4
"Every time I have tried to open, it doesn't load, and instead just shows the logo. I'll improve rating if it is fixed.",1
Thanks for this app we can slecet artist in Spotify and very good quality of sound Thanks,5
"I'm okay with the add for 30s, but FOUR TIMES in a row is just to much. But have wide range of songs to select so it's fine I guess?",3
This app is so annoying I make my Playlist and then it just adds random songs and I can't even delete them I deleted the app and going to find a new one,2
"Previous update is worst! Songs are like music in a pirated cd that has glitched or ""jumping""! And now even in premium i cannot download songs after uninstalling and installing the apps. Like im paying for nothing. 🙄🙄🙄",1
Always opens when connected to Bluetooth via vehicle. O select option not to auto start...still auto start. Would give 5 stars but this kills it for me.,1
The app is good so far but I need to make use of it very well.,4
Worst app ever I can't even sign into this app!! It tells me again and again that the combination of my email and password is incorrect !! Worst app!!😡,1
Using this app since a year now but nowadays the quantity of advertisments are so maore means first I used to recommend people that they can use this app as the music quality is also great and not so much ads but now the ads are uncountable means after every 2 songs they will keep ads they are giving pressure to purchase premium.,2
"This app is great. The only problem that I have with it is that it is really laggy. Some of my songs won't play will use my skips. Also, I'll use one skip and the app won't let me use any more of my skips. This was all a while ago but I thought I should let you guys know. I have premuin now and it works great.",5
ALWAYS has great selection of Music to choose from.,5
How to enable sing feature on Spotify?,3
Great for road trips and working! I enjoy making my own playlists as well as listening to the suggestions that Spotify comes up with based on my previous plays. The family membership helps cut costs as well. I can share music with my husband and vice versa!,5
Why does this application always stop suddenly? I was enjoying the song and it kept stopping? Please fix this issue. Thank you.,1
"Great music that you can't find on Pandora. Music is clear and good quality for the speakers I am listening through, whether it be my car or headphones, great quality.",5
Wonderfully easy app to use which has huge flexibility and amazing features many of which I have not used properly yet. Highly recommended for anyone who wishes to have audio playing as part of their life.,5
"Used to be my go-to app but since this last update it won't let me transfer my files to my data to my SD card, my data connection is NOT very good so I download my most listened to music for offline hence the SD card but now it doesn't work so 1 star... You will belucky if this app remains on my phone",1
I love how many songs it has and how you can make playlist but I hate how many ads there are I skipped one song and got 6 ads,3
Love group listen and shared playlists,5
Easy to compile playlist,5
Makes work more enjoyable! ☺️,5
"Absolutely perfect,the best music app to use,its fast and effective.i gave it five star beacuse i love it.keep up the good work.",5
"Spotify is currently playing suggested songs and nothing actually on my playlists and won't give me my six free skips. It's very irritating. I love this app but not when it does this, please fix.",1
"app is and always was amazing,, even going 3 years back, this is still my 'one of choice'. however recently i downloaded it for mobile and soon found out that after a certain amount of time, you can't play any song from a certain folder you made that you wish to play ; instead having to just play it on shuffle,, annoyingly enough.",3
"Virtually any song at my fingertips, podcasts from my favorite creators, and I can take them to have with needing internet to stream! ♡",5
"The app is extremely buggy now a days. I love the service, the app is garbage",2
Not a good experience at all . I would like to know why my card is billed from this service? Because I never joined this service ever .. I sent an email to cancel after this payment came out on my card .. to find out how and what Is happening and no response.,1
"Why is it when we choose a song this other random song plays!? I hate the ""update"" pls change it",1
Idk wt to say but tooo Gud to be true but I gave 4 stars by of tooooooooooo many adds,4
I will give this a one star cause the new update of this apps is like making me angry everytime I play my favorite song it will change now I will give this 1 star,1
Music lovers biggest fan. Spotify doesn't mess around when it comes to music.,5
They add songs to my playlists and I can't even find them on the playlists anymore so I'm stuck listening to songs I hate and I can't skip them because not only do I have a limited amount of skips but it'll also skip to more songs I can't find on the playlists so I can't edit them out.,4
The ads are too much. I have to listen to atleast 1:30 minutes of ads and it kind of annoying. Please do something about it,3
"Fabulous. Bye bye CD, LP & cassette collection of 1,000+ albums, hello unlimited music 🤘🤘",5
It is a very nice app and I even saw versions of songs I didn't knew were there example tik tok,5
"It keeps popping ""Your offline"" even tho my internet access is strong",4
"So far, so good! If Spotify would be open for suggestions, consider partnership with a strong online startup specializing in providing ACCURATE instrumental score to the songs WE, your customers, listen to. (I'm sure a creative mind would see this and take it to the team.)",5
Easy to navigate. Not too many ads.,5
"So much music, not enough time",5
My always go to app ... Loved every feature of it... Only thing I hate is ads... but other than that everything is perfect..,5
It's an amazing app but sometimes it randomly turns off the music it self while i am writing something (texting someone),4
"This was so amazing until the new update. I'm really disappointed from this app,any song I want to play I can't play, they play different songs from that playlist it's really irritating the new update of this app is making me sick. I'll surely uninstall it if they keep on doing this to me. We can't skip more than 6 times per hour just because we didn't buy the premier that's really rude. Clear all the issue asap. I don't even want to give 1 star because of it's functions but it's necessary :))",1
Ada are not related to anything I'd be interested in at all but with premium the app is amazing.,5
"Like it, is good shows lyrics, but kina bad that u can't individually download songs",3
Very clear sound,5
Worst music app ever in the history!! Ads per every 2 songs. Uninstalling it!,1
Please Remove Episode For You (podcast) from Spotify Home Page.,5
Not sure I'm really ok with artists not being paid appropriately to access their work. It is very handy though to download playlists to use in the car.,4
"While ads are indeed annoying, the most annoying thing on this app is that it adds songs to your playlists without allowing you to remove them. I've tried hiding the songs but nothing works. Not only that but the limited skips are a true pain to many users who can't get premium.",2
Amazing experience but too adds,5
Easy to use and great parental settings,4
This is a good app for songs and podcast but tgere was a issue in the miniplayer on the notification bar. It was showing multiple screens at a time but I fixed it by changing the app notification settings from my phone settings.,5
Excellent but too many advertisement,5
Excellent app took a while to understand how to use no problems now,5
My music skips like a broken cd. Still skips like a scratched cd ugh. I pay too much for these issues.,1
"Every now and then, the media player won't launch. Which means you can can't fast-forward, rewind or skip thru playlists of podcasts. And occasionally the crashes.",2
local files cannot ne read anymore. please fix.,5
"You cannot subscribe via mobile load. The support said ""it shouldn't take long"" and it's already been a week.",1
The best ! Very pleased with the app,5
I've been listening to music with Spotify for well over a decade. It's been really cool watching it grow into the app I now know and love. It's super helpful that I can search for songs by lyrics and song recognization. I do wish the player would automatically show up in my push notifications like it used to on my old phone but I think that's more of a design flaw in my new device's software.,5
Love the variety of music 🎶,5
Excellent sound effect,5
"Why is controlling spotify on my pc from my phone so broken now, what are we even paying for?",2
I keep my Spotify updated but it keeps messing up and won't load my Playlist so I'm paying for a horrible service,1
The app is perfect but after I cancelled my subscription Thay take the money every month non stop. In the app it's saying Free Account and still take the money.,1
Why? I play the song and other song playeddd whyyyyyyy I'm so desapoindet,1
"Premium listener since the start. Love that I can get pretty much anything. And believe me, I have very eclectic tastes. I now have the family plan and my family loves it.",4
"It is not showing lyrics in my phone ,,,. Now its good 👍",5
Always getting ads,2
"App glitches when running in the background and if you pause with the Bluetooth command, you can't play unless you open the app. Sometimes podcasts pause for no reason. Sometimes the podcast keeps playing, but the ""command bar"" at the bottom disappears and you can't go back or pause. For all these reasons the app has to be closed and reopened frequently. This has been an issue forever now and I don't think the dev team will ever fix it.",1
Easy to use. Love it!,5
Please add high resolution audio support...the app is super laggy...and slow.,1
"The app is epic. I don't mind the ads. I just need one thing added and I'd give a 5 start rating no doubt. A personalisation option to change the background in the profile to any default color options like blue, purple, green etc, instead of the default ones, which most of the time don't match with many users' profile pictures. Please try to add this feature",3
This is the best app... But there is so much ad,5
Ads after every 2 songs is ridiculous. I know you want people to pay for premium but this makes me want to get pandora again and pay for that.,1
It's not visible in my app section and when I try to play a music it plays another one so that's why I gave it 3 star but it's such a beautiful app for song love it,3
It is a amazing but the playlist i want is not available,4
Not working on Samsung S21 Ultra,1
Spotify makes it's so much harder to listen to my fav songs or playlist. The new update is just trush i wanna play song playlist in order but it's just automatically shuffles. Plus when i tried to listen to my playlist i hear songs i didn't even added. Spotify just wants your money at this point,1
Simple and functional app.,5
Remove this listenin on ........ popup. We cant search a song.,1
"Spotify, honestly, is one of the greatest platforms out there for music. Basically all I have to say, nothing more to it.",5
"Spotify wrapped is fire and Spotify in general just works very well. I like the enhanced option they added a while back and the lyric & syncing they added is nice. A lot of songs don't have lyric data available though, and even then some don't have syncing data. Still, great app and platform to find and listen to music. Get on a family plan with your friends",5
"Fix the glitch where if you like a song without actually clicking it to make it play, it doesn't actually add to your liked songs. The heart will fill green and appear so but if you go into album and play song, it's not filled green or 'liked'",4
I keep having to reinstall. App will not function normally for over a month. It plays with the button on pause and there is no way to stop it besides force stop...or uninstall. I pay for premium. About to change to another app.,2
"Where did the sing mode go, it was really fun!",5
Very high quality music,5
Seamless music and podcast streaming!,5
Very nice good work but remove those ads,5
Terrible spotify just wants to take your money and make you go premium for only a month you can only listen to your music without going premium on your computer you can't listen to it on the go.,1
"Very easy to use, and I just love it. Plenty of music to play!",5
"Why on earth have you taken a perfectly functional feature like Group sessions and made it worse? You've removed the ability to scan codes, which means when meeting new people I now have to somehow send them a link. You now default to playing music on all devices when I just want the music to come out of the one connected to the speakers. I don't get it, these changes are asinine. Whoever approved these changes need to be fired and you lot need to find the undo button.",1
"Phone broken, bought new one, install Spotify and it won't play songs. My library is on home screen but not in library. Want my subscription money back. Plays on wife's phone but not mine, in fact every time I start Spotify it starts on her phone. Guess you idiots don't even look at these.",1
"Ok I'd probably give it a 5 star if it wasn't for the randomly suggested songs, just please stop suggesting me songs",4
"Good choice if music but it constantly adds random songs to my playlist which I find very annoying and when I'm trying to listen to a song it plays a different song by the same artist or a whole different song that I covered earlier, adds itself",2
The app works pretty much as you'd expect--missing some functionality but at the expense of convenience. And yeah it's bad they don't pay their creators hardly anything. But do you know what's criminal about this app? The fact that even if your liked songs are downloaded AND you have a good enough connection to the Internet (which shouldn't even be required if the songs are already stored locally) you CANNOT load your liked songs. You have about a fifty percent chance to access it at any point,3
Great sound quality and a wide range of music suggestions offered.,5
"Love the app but the Samsung/android glitch is annoying. Having to ""force stop"" the app almost daily to reset the glitch and playback issues.",4
The sound quality is best but the interrupting ads aur so annoying..,3
This is the bestest app I've ever found on play store,5
"Spotify premium is so worth it!!! No ads, Unlimited music plays, download Playlists and podcasts to listen to offline. Great app, would recommend premium.",5
Mobile App keeps saying I am offline so I cannot login but I have Internet connection,1
terrible on mobile i need a subscription to listen to music i want to listen to?,1
"It would have been better if they were lyrics or like the iTunes,01/07/2022 thank you for the lyrics 🥰",5
"You people are utterly useless. Everytime there is an update for the app, something goes wrong. Now the app keeps saying there is no internet connection despite there being connection and all my songs are missing from the list. What are you people doing over there? And I'm a bloody premium member. Getting sick and tired of this.",1
This app is complete trash. Other apps that provide the same service are much more useful than spotify,1
Trying it our with light piano 🎹 music 🎶..very relaxing.,5
Can't download music offline even after purchasing premium plan,1
Too many ads. Not like everyone is gonna buy premium😒,3
Worst app sometimes which I was listening won't come particularlly that podcast not opens please fix the bloody bug Spotify...........,1
"This landscape is resourceful, no doubt about that",5
It's great but would prefer not to have a random songs not in my playlist played when listening to my playlist,4
Amazing really it's very good app to listen ur heart favourite songs🥰✨,5
I love it but ads are too much,3
Spotify has been crashing a lot lately. Beginning to wonder why I pay for premium membership.,2
To find an original content is very easy on Spotify,4
In this app All songs are there,3
"I've been trying to pay for Spotify premium family with my access and each time I input my card details, it shows ""The payment failed. Please try again, use a different card or a different payment method"" But I've used this card for over 3 months",1
"Hello. I've been always using this app and before this, the widget that I put at the home screen always looks like the colour of the song album that I am listening too but I don't know if you are not allowing to use that update anymore or what but I love that update so can you please bring them back?",3
AWFULL APP DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS APP YOU WILL REGRET. LITERALLY SPEAKING .I WANNA GIVE THIS APP -1000×INFINITE RATE .,1
Superior to all other music sharing apps.,5
Had a few issues but mostly enjoy it. Been using Spotify for year's and for me it's the best. Some song's are missing or can't be played but that's ok.,5
The update is so bad. I can't open my Playlist and play my music as I want. I can't put a song on replay... It's just bad,1
Very good app now I can listen to my favourite music without searching on YouTube for songs,5
"Loving these group sessions, this app is really good for when you want to listen to music. Would recccccccommend",5
Gotta love how the ads interrupt the Rogan conversation. Not. I'm fine with ads. But not how they cut off what someone is sayi...,1
I love that I can search song.,5
Perfect app for music,5
This is very helpful when it comes to finding and listening to a good music🥰,5
"Cool App, ❤️ it! Thanks to the Developer",5
Audio quality is lower compared to deezer,3
"Just buy premium and deal with it. I use spotify on my pc, xbox, and phone. Smooth app overall and the playlist creation is straight forward and much appreciated.",5
Why i didn't have the sing-along feature yet? Not available on both mobile app and desktop app 😞 i just updated the latest version. How to get it??,2
Excellent all the music you could wish for...,5
It's amazing. One thing is needed that those who haven't get premium they can't download music at least five can download without premium. But over in all i like Spotify.,5
App often hangs when opening library of downloaded podcast episodes.,2
Nice app there are so many songs but I have 1 problem the problem is ads I think that it will show only 1 ad but no it show 5 ads in 1 time,3
I love this app but does anyone know about karaoke mode how do i get it?,3
"Great stuff ! But I wish z top Carl Perkins song was still Honey, Don't.",5
Typical scum bag company makes it difficult to unsubscribe. Their algorithm is a waste of time it wont fund anythi g si.ilar to what u listen to.,1
Why am I listening to songs that aren't on my playlist which is leading me to skipping so I can actually hear what I want and that's wasting skips 😐,3
Hope to be a free app :'( or make it to have a less advertisement,5
"This app LOVES to stop playing randomly. Do you enjoy listening to music or a podcast? Hopefully you enjoy either one stopping on a dime for no reason at all...because it will. Whether on Bluetooth or not, be prepared for your listening experience to be interrupted by total silence on a regular basis. You'll have to pick up your phone to open the the app and restart it manually. This becomes impossible if you're driving. I've done everything i can to remedy this to no avail. Please fix!",2
Im really enjoying Spotify,5
Amazing for podcast 👍❤️ Quality level is Best 👍☺️,5
"I used have music while I was driving. Now I can't have music or there'll be an accident from constantly having to make sure my screen is on 24/7 like this is YouTube music. I downloaded this because I wanted to listen to music while I drive, not be a mayhem. And I do a lot of driving. So now it's just been empty space in my car for almost a year. So no 5 stars definitely until its fixed. It's a problem you don't care about I know. You have a radio. Just go home and listen then. Not the point.",4
Very ad in this application,3
Too much ads,1
Good experiencing on spotify music,5
"They just say listen add free songs for 30 mins, but after 1/2 songs, when I change the song, advertisements comes.",1
Shuffle function isn't very shuffle. I have about 500 songs I added to one playlist and I hear only about 20 of them repeated randomly every week on my drives to/from work.,2
I love spotify . I paid premium today but I can't log in It says offline As it sends a link It says expired link . Please cooperate. Thank you,5
Here some lyrics are wrong but also iam enjoying the music which makes me so pleasant and makes my mood too good.......................,4
Expensive subscription but gives me access to my old cherish African songs,4
Love how I can listen to all my fav songs and have followers pls follow Emily1111LOL thx,5
This app is not opening I even uninstalled and installed it 10 time's a day and it doesn't even opened......! I need a solution for this❗❗❗❗❗,1
Stotify is a great app and very user friendly 😎,5
Lots of songs connects to devices witch is really use fullfor me,5
Very nice for audio songs,4
Not bad but I couldn't use it offline but everything else was good and the lyrics was the best,3
Exceptional loads of music to listen for the young and not so young.,5
"Too little enjoyment of music played. It's need further upgrades for truetune,360 and spatial sounds play.",4
its really good and easy to use. i use it for a long long time. maybe you can give us discount hahahaha keep it up/good!,5
Each time I make a play list it always adds damn song that I don't want to listen to and I can't remove them and that's why i rate it a 1/5,1
"no functions for convenient listening (I can't even pick the concrete song in the playlist), no pluses at all, uncomfortable application",1
One of the best music apps you can use no cap,5
"Cool idea: when enlarging the real-time lyrics, you should be able to tap above or below sending the song forward or backward where you tapped 🙂",5
Spotify is good Because we can choose any music we want so we don't need YouTube,5
"Trash .... my spotify has been giving me issues for days. Music is just not playing, I had to even delete my playlists. I'm unsubscribing",1
Now are days hearing to many ad even in 30 minutes at least 3-4 ad just like one song one ad. But primer is good. Low price also,4
It's nice to have music at my fingertips,5
Good until you need to get premium. It stops you from doing anything after.,3
I would rate it 4 because of a lot of fussy adds....😑😑..adds adds and adds,4
"Sound is great, but someone can tell me how i find repeat button and how i can choose right song i want head",3
This app so great but Add is coming again and again just after 2 song Why so many adds plz do something,1
What is the fun of remainder ads remove remainder ads for the God sake,1
"this app is great and paying for premium was absolutely worth it, but i have two issues: 1. equalization, there is no place to adjust bass or treble and i that makes me prefer other music apps sometimes. 2. shuffling, the shuffle option in spotify does not work correctly and normally dumps similar songs next to eachother, which is inconvenient. other than that it's an amazing app and would definitely recommend for streaming and downloading music on your phone, computer, tv etc.",4
I had no problems with Spotify until a few days ago.. I used to link it to set my alarm but now it's not qorking the same.. Fix that issue and it's one of the best music apps ever....,5
"Hey plz make some shortcuts to like any song, add to queue, etc You have shortcuts for adding to queue for ""today's top hits"" section but that doesn't work on songs when u open any album of any artist. Plz consider making app even more convenient to user... Also plz add feature to customize home so that we can always add our favorite artist or any segment like ""TTH"" to that place After these features app is gonna be almost perfect.",3
"A good app for streaming music. My only issue is the Equaliser is not easily accessible. You need to go to Settings and scroll right down to find it. This is a bit of a pain, as I need to adjust it almost every time I use Spotify, depending on the music I'm playing or the device I'm playing it on.",4
"They'll put money on hold for themselves in case you Subscribe, don't look see things pending in my account",1
The app is amazing good app no ads just music... its real music.good vibes,4
I hate this app because it won't let me change the song it forces me to finish the song that is playing,1
"This version its worse you cant play a song,The old version is better than this please change for us if not you are going to lose,its becoming worse",1
I'm using spotify as a premium member since multiple years on multiple different devices. Experience with this app is getting worse every day. Here's a collection of issues I had so far on Android (as I said it seems to be getting worse by the day) - crashes - freezes - random redownloading of your already downloaded music - wacky behavior when in offline mode - randomly starting to play music even if you don't want to - not showing the correct song - not being able to stop a song,2
I have a complaint . Spotify app will be not working on my device please clear the complain sudently .,1
"Song recommendations is superb! But at atist profile in discovery section if possible pls ad- single, ep, album in 3 rows or column . So it will be more user friendly.",5
I like Spotify easy to use lot of different kind of music very enjoyable.,5
"I love Spotify app, it helps u enjoy mor",5
Super fun and enjoyable,5
This is being a great app for music and podcast I have been using this app for many years now I have re installed it spotify is giving me little problem in listening for the podcast and playlist it's not opening my playlist so can you please just clear this problem otherwise the Apple great love this app ❤,5
"Could you please bring back the phone number sign in, am unable to recover my account",4
Nothing but a good time every time I turn it on!,5
Can't find saved playlists on latest android update,1
It is very good for music and podcasts,5
I dont have the canvas feature in my spotify even after uninstalling and reinstalling it. I want that feature. How can I get that?,1
Very nice app but ads are more,3
"My screen just remains blank after opening the app. I tried clearing space, restarting the app and my phone but to no avail. I wrote the above review last year and now it has happened again.. right after I payed My premium. Like really Spotify???",1
Been using spotify for years only thing that bothers me is i cant afford premium so i have to shuffle play everything,4
it has been a ride i dont want to get of...,4
Awesome and Easy-user!,5
"Full of ads, a lot of times I get up to 5 30-second ads successively It's really annoying",1
"For the most part, the app works well, just occasionally you might have to 'force close' when it misbehaves, especially when switching to different devices. The sheer amount of music available is staggering.",4
Very easy to find any song you like no matter how old it is,5
I really like spotify but only because i bought premimum,4
"When searching in ""your library"" it no longer shows playlists, it just shows artists. I want to look for my playlists under my library, not artists please change it back (4 updates later & it's still not fixed). And please stop pushing podcasts on the home screen, I never listen to them and even after selecting 'not interested in this show' the same show appears again. In fact 80% of the home page is recommendations that I will never click on, making it pointless and not worth checking.",1
It's really a good app.... 💜💜💜 😀 I love it 😊when I'm bored then I listen the songs on spotify for my mind fresh...nd the songs make me relax..😊😀😀😀😀,5
"Great app but......too many ads, I mean, ok if u want us to buy premium but atleast there should not be an ad after every song",4
Easy way to hear yr favourite song ☺️,5
This app was fantastic all my favorite song was here,5
I Can't going to give this app even one star yrr Mtlbb Itne Ads Kon show krta wo v music app me it's a worst music app i hv ever had due to their ads after every two song.....😡😡this is very bad app,1
Why so hard for payment premium now? Why it must be with credit card?,3
This a awsome music app i love it........❤️🥰,5
"It's gotten so bad recently. The ads are so much louder than the music. After hearing a mellow song and being blasted at double the volume an ad really sucks. Now the app also strated to just stop playing and needs to be force shut down, most of the time it seems to get stuck at playing an ad, even though my internet connection is good.",1
This app very good every one should try it,5
Less than intuitive user interface.,3
It is very nice app. We can listen song with playing games also...😉😉,5
This app is very good and i must busy in this app,4
I like that you can make your on playlist.,4
"I'm seriously gonna delete the app, can't even pick a song of my choice! It randomly shuffle songs everytime 🙂 seriously annoying",1
"Sound quality is just amazing, love everything about it",5
"Abouslty love it! But just one problem before i had one ad and then 30 minutes without ads but now its 3 ads, is it a glitch? Well its still an amazing app! 😃",4
"I have a problem in my spotify and that is ""it is not opening,when i try to open my spotify it only shows the app icon on a black screen"" pls help me spotify's team. It would mean alot!",1
"I deleted than re downloaded the app and it got stuck on the loading screen, I've tried restarting my phone, deleting and re installing the app, and the website works fine but I really wanna listen to music, pls fix",1
Cant believe I pay $11 aud a month for a service that doesn't open.,2
Fantastic music app and probablythe best,5
Now I can't control the audio level with the volume keys on my phone. Brilliant change in functionality 🙄,4
The app and quality is damn good but I just suggest that there should be an option to chat with your friends if you add that it would be fantastic💥,4
"Idk what is my Spotify's problem like whenever I open the app it says ""no internet connection"" and then i have to refresh it like 2-3 times then it works properly also sometimes when I play a playlist it jumps to another song of the playlist means it doesn't play one after one it jumps after 2-3 songs and play that another song.",1
Why do you still force adds if I already pay the premium subscription?,1
I tried playing a song but it played a suggested song,4
It's very easy to search music 🎶🎵🎶,5
"The free version of Spotify is great on pc and the xbox, but terrible on phone. I only use it to edit my playlists. Just use youtube.",1
"I am using premium, but I can't find the canvas option in my account. Is it just in my case or the option has not come in Bangladesh yet? please fix this 🙂",3
I like it but now there is a bug now when I press the repeat button the app crashes that's all I have experienced I will up fate you guys more but still this is a great app!,4

It's an overall good experience but I'm just not going to pay money to have more than six skips an hour,1
"dog app, cant even log in..",1
There isn't a free to use version in Korea. What a rip off.,1
Needs better audio quality.,3
"Amazing, but stop disabling my songs please!",1
best music app hands down!,5
The app isn't working it won't even open it just sits at a black screen forever,5
It's a good way to find good songs,5
I'm having worst experience with this app because after every single song you start ads which is very frustrating😤,1
"Enhance feature was removed, I don't know why, it was actually a really good feature.",4
So many fun things and songs,5
It shuffles into other song instead of the song I'm looking for,1
Umm it was great before but currently there's too much ads and the limited skips are kinda annoying.... Overall it's pretty decent ( might be better idk ) compared to other music apps,3
It gives me so many options i just feel like 10 skips an hour would be a major plus.,4
Personalization is their Forte love having Playlists designed just for me!!! DAILY,5
"I can always get to music I enjoy provided I have signal. Been using the app for years, been using premium and it's entirely worth every cent. The only thing that gets annoying is that the songs I use the feature to ignore/skip still will play when I'm playing albums and I have to skip them manually. Love the songs the personalized albums come up with though.",5
"It be pretty aight if you don't skimp the premium downloads go by quick on not the best internet so you don't need a GOATED or God CPU ETC, ETC bing bong £u€k ya life™",4
"It's a good music app for Samsung's and Android, if you buy/get the family plane then you don't get the aids",5
"Updating my review to say it's still great. Only issue is large playlists seem to have issues shuffling, sometimes just play the same 60 or so songs.",5
There Are Lot Of Songs & Playlists To Listen.....Really An Good App🎧,5
"Why is it that we pay for premium but still get ads for every page on the app? Who gives any about podcasts?? Seriously, we aren't paying for a new set of advertisements. Maybe try listening to your consumers? It has also been glitching lately as well... it is the only app that will not connect to the internet.",2
Nice to listen to music while just walking,4
"All features are good except the problem of showing no internet connection while searching a song even when there is good internet connection, i think this issue is faced by many users.",3
It's so great I love it so much I have no complaints,5
Good suggestions. Great dance music options when it gets me in the moose,4
"Charged multiple times only to be told its ""lost payment"" and keep losing connection with online assistance. Use to be my favorite app for music now id rather get bugged and download online then use such a bugged out app. Update; Now they charge me for a solo account and a duo so what in the he'll is happening!!!! @spotify respond to my emails",1
It's been an awesome experience and every music sounds so great to here at Spotify at any moment as well too!!!! I enjoyed it every moment.,5
Its great no issues from my side very much actually,5
Cool app but why do u have2go2the extremes 2 delete sumthin.. Besides that 2 👍's up,4
Can you make it easier to move multiple songs from to playlist to playlist Please!,5
"I like this app but why do we have to have premium before we can turn off shuffle? In my playlist, many songs were skipped because of the shuffle, most of the songs I like.",3
It has my favorite songs and artist 😌😍,5
Excellent. I had Amazon but cancelled and switched to Spotify.,5
Sound quality is best butAfter playing 1 song their started play 4 ad at a time this start to irritate the music lover's,3
I love spotify but recently it will stop my music alot of times during the song even if there downloaded,3
It's an awesome app! It has all my favorite songs and I can listen to music all I want on it! 😆😜,5
Very good experience bt should add more songs for India region,5
"Except for the frequent invasive ads, Spotify is a great tool for checking out new music before I decide to go out and buy a CD. Old music as well!!",5
Bug after bug after bug.,2
The only music app I can trust :)),5
"I can't play music, my playlists won't show up, and if it shows up it just has one song. I installed 3 times if it still 'stuck' like before and yes it is. I hope this getting reply. Edit: these past week I can play music and songs in my playlist aren't gone anymore, Thank you Spotify for fix it.",5
"It was working great up until a 4 days ago! Just keeps telling me there's an issue and won't play anything!. I've uninstalled, installed and even tried my acct on another phone with no luck. And I know my subscription will be going out in the next week and for what!!?? Please help!",1
Very useful application form song,1
The ad experience is horrific and if I make a playlist containing 20 or so songs I'm lucky if I get to hear a single 1 from it I used use this app exclusively and now its unbearable,1
It made me have to log back in and now if won't let me log back in,2
The best music application there is.,5
This app is awesome but the ads every now and then take a while but other than that the app is amazing great sound,5
From last update music cast is not connected,3
This app is the best music and podcast app ever it might get a little touchy but is very reliable!!!!!!!!!,5
"Spotify is good for listening to songs in the background and is a really good app for music, but I rated it 2 stars because sometimes I accidentally press the don't recommend the song button and even after I change it back to not be it doesn't let me listen to it. If they fix this I will bring it to 5 stars but right now, it's 2 stars",2
I love this app. It has so many genres to pick from. So many songs to chose and you can follow your friends and listen to there playlist. I like how for instance Salish Matter isn't like Drake but you can still listen to her music. ❤,5
"Hi, I just start using it and till now it is great, thanks",5
Very easy to use and handy when ant got any data,5
It's become really annoying to have to always restart the app so I can see what song is playing on the home screen. Even then it doesn't show up. I just expect more from an app I pay for. It's super inconvenient and I use this app all day everyday. Please see to fixing these bugs Spotify.,5
"too much ads, hate it",3
"Spotify free used to work normal with ads. After purchasing premium, search results, song selection, literally any action keeps the app loading forever !",1
It's cool with premium but without it I can't even select songs without premium.,2
"Great music app with variety selection of songs. Also, user-friendly operation to your own liking.",4
Great music app I love it I highly recommend it 👍,5
Most entertaining and user friendly good app...,5
"It's always been a great streaming service. I've let my subscription cancel for years and come back to my same massive library, fully intact.",5
The podcasting has been pretty bad with losing your place and altogether skipping to the end when you try to start it up making it completely un enjoyable for me to the point where I didn't listen but something seems to have changed in the last few days and things have worked normally so whatever you guys might have done good job,4
I've used this app for about a month now and I'm 99% happy with it. Every now and then there are little glitches but they are easily fixed. Much better than Amazon music!,5
"Awesome experience with Spotify, try it it's really amazing 😎😄",5
"COVID warnings on podcasts now?? Are you kidding? 2+ years later? Now? Super LAME!! Download a podcast to play later, forget about it. Why? Because you NEED AN INTERNET CONNECTION!? Huh?? If it wasn't for Joe Rogan, I'd have bailed on this app a long time ago. it's so glitchy, unreliable, counterintuitive, stupid warnings. I have to force close it constantly & restart and sometimes it jumps to a totally random podcast maybe even a year old??",1
"I don't know about the paid version; ask someone else about that. As for the free version, way too many ads to even think about enjoying music, not to mention all the politically correct podcasts and musicians. Uninstall...",1
I like the app. But why have you been restricting Neil Young songs?,5
Very enjoyable and easy to use,5
"what happened to ads every other 30 minutes. Now it's ads every 4-5 songs. So damn annoying dude. Please consider adding less ads, or some kind of solution. Thanks.",1
"I love it the only thing is that I wish the UI/UX was more fluid and less boxy, and I wish that I could DISABLE lyrics instead of always having it on",4
It is the best app for good music 🎶 like it that why agive it five stars 🌟,5
"Hope to learn how to go along singing, wonderful. Thank you so much.",5
love listening to music while I walk,5
This use to be a great app but there is way too many ads between songs. 1 or 2 is fine for the free version but 6 or 7 is ridiculous. I will be searching for a new music app unfortunately,1
good app latest & Old song,5
"to me spotify is so easy,with a robust library from old to new and all genres,i just absolutely must have it every day",5
"Well, it continously says offline and to get online to listen to anything. I am online....🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️😒",1
I'm honestly thinking about canceling my family plan cause you removed shuffle play all my song bring it back and I'll stay,1
"Great, a wonderful discovery!",5
it has all songs and I love how you can have a Playlist also a suggestion is where u can watch the music video while listening to the song,5
Satisfying and entertaining and also a relaxing school of learning.,5
best music app I've had...they have all the songs from each genre that i like to listen to and new songs that I enjoy!,5
"This is for Jill Wells Art mostly. I've enjoyedspotifymostly(beenGreatly annoyedattimesAlso) for years once I figured out how to makemy ownPlaylists.I was no longer at the mercy of shuffle play unlessIwabted2b and could also key queuefrom playlists made. Have you consider making then dnlg list,then go offline to listen. Sometimes its the best way. My only gripe isIwish there was a automatic filter that wouldnt allow me to DLsONGS I've already DL!! That would make my life 4000+ songs ALOT better",5
Great app has all of my favorite music choices,5
Love it's to listen the music I Want,5
I really like the app just that the ads can be really disruptive. But you can make playlists for you and your friends so I say its a pretty nice app.,5
I can listen to the music I prefer.,5
No need to say anthing but the fact that its just good,5
The easy to use your Facebook for log in,4
Too many adds . Can enjoy music.,1
Its the one of the best music applications i have ever used. It also has the great podcasts,4
"I love the app , there is nothing wrong with it . Just perfect. I rate it 100/100.Thank you",5
"Love the app..the lyrics viewer just got an update which makes the experience so much better..another feature I would really like spotify to adopt and I especially think it will change the way people use Spotify drastically is the addition of videos, I know it may be a very difficult thing to do but if it's possible I hope it can be done in the future and also when is the long awaited HiFi audio features coming.",5
Love this app.. but why is it everytime I'm in my feels listening to sad music a ad comes on atp I don't even wanna cry anymore u ruined it. U guys are like listening to me cry it seems like it 😻.,4
Premium here. It works well ... For about 10 seconds per song.,1
"I get the whole advertisement but at this point you're overdoing it. I only hear about three to two songs and then I hear about 5 ads, are you kidding me?? Two songs and in-between there's two ads Chill out with the advertising it's really difficult for me to enjoy your damn app and I'm a teenager so I can't afford your premium but at least give us a break from the advertising. I hear more ads than music my god",3
It's perfect on my watch Samsung Galaxy watch for classic,5
I am using for almost a year but i dont know how to listen offline music after get downloaded ?,1
"I like the newly added recommendations being played through your history list songs after they've ended. It's a nice touch and a good way to find new music. Please don't kill this feature, it'll be very disappointing, I honestly don't mind not having the history list play by song.",5
The audio of the songs is not consistent. Some are too soft i can hardly hear.,1
I love Spotify the music is endless and so worth the subscription!,5
Gives great music at touch of a button,5
I didn't realize until it went away that it starts you off with a free sample of premium. I liked the app until premium went away. Now you can't even pick the songs you want. You can only shuffle playlists. And if you try making your own Playlist Spotify adds songs to it that have nothing to do with the ones you added yourself. Over all I'm very disappointed with my experience with this app. It's pretty cool with premium but the free version is disappointing.,1
"I like your 30 mins uninterrupted, but its hard to enjoy when you software runs with the processing power of a 2 year old with down syndrome! Take a lesson from YouTube and actually play what people search for!",2
Absolutely useless !!!!! App is permanently offline which makes it useless and unusable !!!!! Why even present this app if it doesn't not work !!!! I was recommended to use Spotify by many colleagues I respect !!! But now I wonder !!!! Don't know if you can help or not but I will change my attitude if help does fix the problem 😶,1
Music galore! Would be better if you fixed the equalizer,2
Very useful in a quite time,5
"Spotify is an excellent music app,i just love this",5
"I rate spotify 3 stars because I loved it, I enjoyed it. if not because Im not able to play my downloaded songs while offline even if im on premium, I could have been given them 5 stars. because of this, i just undo my subscription",5
"Spotify is literally the best. You can listen to any song you want and it's better than the competition. Only downside is the 4 advertisements that play every 15 minutes. Other than that though, Spotify is great.",5
"Good app, yet recently I've noticed that alot of my songs are being removed for some reason? Would like to know why please.",4
Spotify is spot on,5
Great for podcast and mostly all music highly recommend,5
Yes I would write you a fight cuz I love Spotify but since I got premium for almost a year now y'all have taken two payments off of my card,4
"Want to listen to a song? Too bad, you have to pay to listen to what you want to hear. Otherwise have this playlist of 90 songs and pray the one you want to hear shows up! Don't wanna hear ads between songs without paying an arm and a leg? Tough luck buddy! Avoid at all costs.",1
"I find this app ok, to many freaking ads though 🙄",3
"I had Spotify for years now and I was always very happy with it. Now for the first time in my life I have Spotify without premium and it is the biggest piece of s*** I have ever encountered. I would give it 0 stars or less, but with premium it is actually very good so two stars.",2
Ads are annoying but other than that it's fine,4
"Don't add songs to my custom Playlist that I put my songs on, I make custom Playlists because I want to only hear the songs on said Playlist not what you recommend to me",1
This app is the best app in the sector of free streaming of music and audio!! Though sometimes you may get several ads but you can purchase an individual premium plan for just 119 per month which is reasonable.And the quality of sound is of top quality! This app is unbeatable.I love this app and using since 2020.🤗,5
Alot of my playlist is not downloading,3
"Best music app. I've been using it for about 2 or 3 years and it's been great. The ads are kind of a problem but it doesn't really bother me. I hate that there's only 6 skips per hour. But the app is still great. Has all the music i look up. Country, rap, all the stuff I love. 10/10",5
I love this spotify app but the adds are more,3
Awesome to listen to my favorite music anytime!,5
Okay Spotify if its free thin you guys need to stick to that no b.s with limited skips really in my opinion Spotify needs to be pulled off the app store just because of how messed up Spotify is it plays songs I have no interest in and the add wall is so bad I only use it for my xbox,1
Plays and adds random music that you can't get rid of. Won't let me play the songs I wanna play. I hate the new version,3
Get to listen to my music which is perfect,5
For whatever reason I can't scroll to see the different genres/moods for my liked songs.,4
Wonderful music to work by and easy to select tunes and artist that I enjoy the most. Great variety,5
"Awesome, but 3 stars for a few reasons; 1. App crashes consistently on my phone. 2. I have to wait a hour just to get 6 skips. 3. Umm.. No third reason but three stars is my rating",3
An update of the app took it all away. Will uninstall.,1
okay no one wants their playlists to be shuffled all the time bruh and those limited skips-,1
"Great app, easy to use,.never any problems",5
Vary awaome platform to use. Everything is so easy to learn. I have yet to not find a song I searched....,5
I love my music and especially Morbid crime podcast!,5
Most of the play list are fake/false. Like u search for lets say linkin park andthe playlist named literally linkin park is having every kind of songs but linkinpark. Waste of money,1
Love how i get two back to back ads ... like why?,2
"Normally I would put 5 stars as I love Spotify. But while I thought the issue had been fixed, I updated the app today and once again, while connected to any Bluetooth device, my music is stopping randomly, multiple times, on EVERY SINGLE song. It's not an issue with my phone as I do not have this issue with any other media streaming app, and it's not the Bluetooth device because it happens on multiple devices. Please fix this.",4
Tbh i have a few suggestions to the app But i love how you can watch 3 ads to get 30 minutes free listening i love that Ill update my comment and ill add the suggestions later.,5
Recent updates have made the app completely useless for a month now even though I'm paying for the service. It won't load anything or play anything. Pretty disappointed from a service I use daily.,1
I've spent years building a playlist and all of them are gone now. I was first a free user and have been on the paid family plan for the last year. Everything is gone since the last two updates and I can't use it at all. Edit: I discovered the app works on Roku but not my android phone. I obviously can't use my Roku in the car! Please fix it!,1
"I get not being able to do some things but some are just ridiculous, heres a list . 1- not being able to choose a song on a playlist 2- not being able to chance the second of the song 3 cant go back to the song before 4 NO QUEUE 5 limited skips 6 CANT REPLAY A SONG??? 6 being stuck with randomizer on 7 WHY DOES IT PLAY RANDOM SONGS BRO THEYRE NOT EVEN ON MY PLAYLIST ???",1
STOP WITH THE ADDS AFTER EVERY SONG! Fair enough every 30mins. BUT. EVERY. SONG. Is an overkill. Be a bit considerate for those of of who are clearly trying to budget with not spending $110/year for music.,2
"app just suddenly ceased to work properly, can't even browse or play any songs (samsung galaxy s9 plus)",2
"Spotify is great and I don't mind ads every once in awhile but the ads are starting to get excessive. I swear it feels like I'll listen to three songs and get three ads after. Sometimes even after the ""30 mins of uninterrupted listening"" ad I'll get an ad two songs later.",4
This is just an amazing platform that gives you variety and Platform Church (Rested Life) content everything is in it and our members love it.,5
"Bots add thing to ur playlist. Cant even play a regular song u searched up, it just puts a random song on you dont like. I miss the old spotify.",1
I like the app it's a good music app but I find the library limited when compared to YouTube mother or less commercial breaks and for shorter time. I never look at Spotify before but clearly they're more options comparing the two music platforms it's like apples and oranges give it a shot tell me what you think,4
You can't play specific songs unless you pay. You can get free alternatives so don't shill for some big corporation - there are better ways to support smaller artists.,1
I can't play some 8d music. It sucks,3
My go to app when I wanna listen to music or a podcast,5
Easy access to play my favorite music at any time. Easy to find my favorite artist and the songs with lyrics,5
Hey Spotify why you always beg for money with your adds ever 5 minutes. have some standards reduce your adds a little bit or should I say begging for money like a begger,1
Very nice i love spotify,1
Great it allows you to listen to music while on other apps,5
"I swim and listen to Spotify, the whole family loves music.",5
It sucks I use it when i can't find a certain thing on SoundCloud but that's about it. It's pretty trash,5
I've had Spotify for over 2 years and they've been great. Thanks Spotify!!!,5
Love all of the choices you can make Groups of music you can even search for,5
"Love Spotify Premium. It's affordable, I can listen from all my devices, and I get showtime as a bonus!",5
"Many bugs, delay, freeze and problems on my phone.",1
"Spotify premium is still my favorite music app. Where else would I be able to get three months of premium for just $9.99(for ALL three months). Best deal ever. Thanks for the ability to listen to anything I want ad Free! I've got to let you know, that you should definitely subscribe to Spotify premium today. Keep cranking out the tunes, we'll keep listening.",5
"I need to update but until then it is really bad because when you play a song, instead of playing that song it plays like 100000000 others and it takes REALLY long so yeah",1
i think this will be my last year on spotify i wont be renewing my premium since they removed the widget which is the best feature they have.,1
Been using Spotify for 8 years and no complaints!,5
Good music experience All songs r available in this😘😘😘,5
Im getting frequent information from my anti virus as spotify have infected app. This leads to steal my information like that i don't know why. Please check. I can't use any app after installing your app,4
It's nice playing songs YOU want when YOU want them DESPITE the ads that make them FREE!!,5
"PLEASE make playlists for podcasts where it will play the latest episodes of eg. three podcasts I have added to a playlist. Like in daily drive, but customisable!",3
"Awesome, it has every song you want",5
App has all songs I search and is very efficient and gives best music sound too. I love it.,5
This app is good but I hate the new update I hate how you can't pick the songs you want to hear without Premium its so annoying,3
Lately there's been Glitches in the showing of Album Artwork,1
Has way too many adds and they are supper long and you can't pick the song you want to listen to unless you pay for a subscription otherwise it would be ok,3
Great music ads are repetitive but my choice not too pay,5
I use the app. Often ond enjoy the music and song that are available,5
I love spotify and I have been listening music on it for several months but nowadays the app just stops working while a song is playing or you click on a artist and the music pauses. I had already tried restarting my phone or reinstalling the app but it didn't work. It would be very helpful if you fix that bug.,4
Fix the app its not starting,1
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNTIL THEY FIX THE PROBLEM WITH ANDROID, this has been going on for weeks. Spotify will not start. I have tried everything that has been suggested and I pay for a premium subscription.",1
I was listening to music suddenly it stopped and they logged me out i am trying to log in several times with my one plus 7 but it is showing something went wrong,5
This app is not working smoothly,1
"Everything's okay, really really good. But I have problem about when I want to share the song to stories IG, font is so big than normal. Pls fix it.",4
"I've had awesome service with you guys, Thank you very much and have a blessed day.",5
"3 stars, solid app. However after the newest update ive been experiencing some difficulties, im unable to play most songs, including from playlists. itll play for about 9-11 seconds then stop and not play again. If this gets fixed I'll make this review 5 stars for sure.",5
"when I want to add songs to my playlist I can't preview the song anymore. Please bring this feature back, most of my playlist consists of previewing a song and adding it to my playlist. I can't add new songs without it and I want to branch out my tastes of different artists but if I can't preview their songs and albums I can't branch out. Please bring this feature back. Edit: I still have a problem, when I look up an artist I can't preview their songs.",3
Love this streaming platform but would appreciate if they step up their sound quality 💜,4
love this app!!! podcasts also help me a lot.,5
"2/5 because of the inability to delete your recently played history now. Edit 1/5 because now you can't even choose what song in your playlist to play, you can't reorder your songs, AND you have limited skips?! I fail to understand your reasoning. The ads haven't bothered me (yet) but should it I would rate this 0 stars if I could, only redeeming factor is the quantity of songs, opposed to the quality of the app.",1
"I want to know what happend the collaborative button because now i cant add songs on others people's playlist. I updated it many times but the collabrative button wont pop up, and also can you guys put a spotify chat system on there its gettin really boring trying to talk by putting songs on other people's playlist Overall its great.",5
"One of the best music apps. Hiding songs plays them anyway, so what's the point of that feature? Song categories are getting ridiculous but what can we expect in this new world.",4
"Myself, I enjoy sitting and listening to the old time radio stories from my childhood.",5
Too many adds,2
"Music is my life and I mean to find almost every single song I want is absolutely awesome. Great job and and awesome effort to keep Spotify up to date, thx Spotify team💪🏼🔥",5
Spotify is not the app is literally like when you click to play your playlist it's not like how it used to be now just generates on some random song and it's not fun I can't start from the beginning and it limits how many songs you can swipe you can only do six per hour why Spotify tell me cuz this is not making sense like I downloaded this app to listen to music but now I can't and I don't like the app anymore that's why I give the one star cuz of this Spotify needs to update their pictures,1
I love the app but i hate when i play a song it gives me another song of the same creator its really annoying,4
I had used iheart radio for years. I will no longer use iheart due to them pushing their GAY agenda on their users. I got tired of gay ads every 10 minutes. I switched to Spotify and hope they are better.,5
"The best app ever, i wish the premium would be cheaper but I just can't live without it",5
"I listen to podcast everyday, worth the family subscription",5
"Annoying that it starts playing randomly in my car. It auto starts when I turn my car on, when I answer a call, when I hang up, when I turn my stereo on, etc. If I turn off permissions to avoid this then it doesn't work properly. Like the service, hate the app.",1
"Great app, but the removal of car integration sucks. You had a feature that worked well, for tons of people, and removed it just to push your own hardware, screwing over everyone.",4
"such a good app, with or without premium they have lots of songs and i know it can be a little annoying when spotify adds songs to your playlist but the songs they add are based off your recent searches so theyre not even bad songs and at least when you watch and ad you get rewarded with 30 mins of uninterupted listening! they have basically every song. such a great app... and its free too!",5
Living below the poverty level and getting to listen to the vast collection available for free is wonderful. Sure I'd like the perks of membership but I can deal with having way less ads than radio ever had.,5
I wish I could date my Spotify playlist,5
"My music sometimes turns off even when my sleep timer isn't set, but not often. I really like the app, but it's unfortunate that we must pay so much to access premium features. I guess $5 would be alright, but $10 for just music seems like a lot. Even streaming services like Disney+ charge less, but the premium features are still nice (I got it so I could download my music to listen to when I travel).",4
I love to play Spotify 😊😊 🎧,5
Updates use too much data.,1
Fantastic a great mix of everything and anything.... Tunetastic,5
"The leader in its field, top quality app.",5
"It's my daily use app, One of the few & One of the Best out there.",5
The annoying back to back ads just spoils the whole mood.,1
To much ad. Frustrating,2
This is not app this is life for depressed one to come out of depression,5
The so takes forever to load playlists,4
Lyrics aren't available for any of the songs (latest updated),1
"Better than Apple itunes by far. More music different styles of music 🎶 absolutely worth $9.99 a month I don't listen to my radio or pay for XM radio when I can listen to anything without commercials and radio talk. I like apple music. But nothing beats"" Spotify""!!!!",5
One of the most favourite application but now it's the most worst app and I hate it. Always keep saying no internet connection blah blah. No songs play. Why? Very disappointing. Never expect this from this app. It's quite famous and I think popularity makes people blind.,1
This is the best app to listen to music to,5
"Nice, got my lyrics. Thanks",5
Paid accounts still have advertisements on podcasts,4
Excellent musical choices!,5
Never had any issues. Music is always current and I like that there is a wide variety to choose from.,5
Want better tamil lyrics in both english and Tamil. Sometimes autoplay song genre based on search is unrelated. Ad appearing in between two songs is quite hindrance,3
I do love this app for all of my music. Except for the fact that if you don't pay you don't get the premium which means you don't get anything that you want. You have unlimited number of skips for the premium and you don't with the free version. I can make my own playlist with a premiums can't with regular. I guess it is worth the $9.99 to get the premium. Unless you don't use it as much as I do which is everyday.,4
It doesn't working says run time exception many times I have deleted and reinstall it then also it's saying than useless app,1
Why can't u just send password reset? U send to email and I only can open email in my phone. Cannot use other devices,2
I love spotify I've been using it for something around 3-4 years and have personally not really had any problems and I use this app almost everyday it's easy to use you can find some really good artists and songs just by listening to your discover weekly which recommends you songs based off what you have been listening to,5
I used to have pandora but switched to this and never looked back highly recommend switching💯👌,5
"Premium user. Managed to somehow turn car mode back on in settings on my previous phone, now it's greyed out and there is no SAFE driving option. Horrible planning on their part to discontinue car mode before having a replacement ready. Another issue is shuffle, I'll have hours of music in a playlist and it still plays multiple songs from one artist. Also wish I was recommended better music, rarely find something new I like in Discover Weekly.",3
All songs all the time but without premium the ads are a little bit annoying,5
Best streaming online app for music and your favourite artiste.,5
Great music selection and very easy to navigate,5
"Everytime i go on it i have to wait 5 minutes for it to actually load properly. I tried uodsting it, deleting and reintalling it hutbhasnt worked",2
"Good but I got a message ""something went wrong, try again"" I've triple checked and everything but it still appears that and it logged me out of my account and only that account that gives me that messagd",3
This up is good for listening to music you can even do it when you turn your phone off it's great,5
It is the best app for streaming music 🎶,5
The app was great until it changed my play/pause button from middle to left. I asked twitter support for help but they couldn't rectify the problem after multiple attempts. they changed back,4
Does not let me play my entire library. There are too many albums to like individually,1
Really good for music. No bofering for me.,5
Its worst app so much ads ...,1
"I enjoy listening to podcasts, but the app has problems. It keeps locking up and closing on my Galaxy 22, and listening to downloaded content. Primarily having to switch between listening Online and Offline. I live in the sticks and do not have good cell service or wifi at home & listen to podcasts. There is absolutely no possible reason I should have to switch between modes to listen to content I have downloaded to device! I paid for service so I would be able to download & listen.",1
"ABSOLUTE TRASH ON MOBILE. All I wanted to do was make a Playlist of 4 songs and play it. Didn't even play a single song of mine and just kept playing random ""similar"" songs, song after song. After I had to waste time googling for a fix. Found the fix and turned off ""autoplay similar songs."" Still didn't play my Playlist songs. TRASH ON MOBILE. Not to mention I remade the Playlist from scratch about 5 times and it still didn't play a single song of mine.",1
"I miss linear notes, cover art, lyrics (like real ones, not autotech guessing), bios (accurate), musicians, vocal, producing credits and please get rid of the fake albums for which none of the songs are available to hear. Other than that, and the constant glitches in sound, it's just dandy.",2
It's a good app and i would have given 5 stars but after new update my Spotify is stuck at Spotify logo whenever I launch application.Developers pls fix this as soon as possible,2
There should be an option to remove songs which we don't like from auto generated playlists.,3
As some songs are not available at it so m giving it 4 stars and hope u gonna fix it asap.. ≥﹏≤,4
pls reduce ur ads some of us cant buy premium cuz their parents think its a waste of money.,4
Works well in car and car picked up via bloothtooth automatically.,4
This is a star I gave him a lot Why can't I listen to it in Iran? Then your countries start pondering and say freedom and ...? Then we can not listen to our country?..A student ... teenager ... you do not value us listening to our favorite songs because we are from Iran... Do you think we love ourselves here?We are in pain but we do not have the right to speak ... This is just music ....Do you really take this from us?,1
enjoying listening music.,5
Overall the app is very good but we cant downlaod the song without premium if you remove thing your rating got 4.8,3
Spotify is a joy to use. I love the playlists it automatically generates. The playlists are based on the type of songs you listen to. This introduces you to other artists you might not have heard of. You can also create your own playlists.,5
Hi thanks my enjoying times o.k. function great my system I use stops two day after heat resistance? Cool,4
"Lost without this app. I have more access to any music and podcasts than ever , part of my life now",5
"Worst, there's no place for those who try to play it without subscription. There's a ad in every single song",1
Sound quality is decreasing...,3
"I used to love Spotify but now I kill it weekly. If I don't reinstall, the platform does work as it once did. My main grump is that I can't fast forward 15 seconds on podcasts after a while. I have to clear data just to revive the function",3
Well.......what.....to....say.....about this app it's great as you all know and heard of. For the ones who are K-POP fans it's great for them.....❤️❤️😘,5
I use spotify everyday and keep adding to my playlist! Limited ads and I easily find artist and songs. Highly recommend this app!!,5
"Too many bugs too often. It's great when it works, but i would expect it to maintain its functionality as I'm paying for a premium service. Pretty disappointing with all the bugs and regular glitches",3
Excellent and convenient,5
Very laggy on android phones,3
I don't like ads between music. And don't want to take subscription.,1
Best songs quality and very easy to use . 😊😊,5
"perfect for anyone who wants to listen to podcasts and music free with ads. my only problem being it will sometimes not let me log in, but this is rare",5
So many issues with the app.. I ve had spotify for years but seriously this is getting annoying. Also the 'spotify community' page is an absolute joke. Someone just replies with the classic clean re install 'solution' and marks it as solved. I have 40 GBS of music.. if I have to re download one more time I swear I am gonna lose it.,1
The sound is very clear.,5
"It's the go to app for music. The swipe gesture was a long awaited and great addition. It would be worth 5 stars, but I have unliked songs too many times accidentally due to the position of the like button. If it were only visible inside the player it would mean less accidental touches.",4
Simply simply lovely.,5
"Solid expirence, high quality music listening.",4
Why is there no repeat button???,4
Love being able to travel intimate to whatever decade I'm feeling atvthe moment!,5
Don't know happaned to this app but it is slow now.....to play or find a song takes forever now... it is very irritating and i seriously consider unsubscribing and quitting using it,2
Too much ads,2
Love listening to all my old 80s favorites on Spotify,5
"My fav music source- in the car and at home, meets all the needs and adding to playlists is super easy",5
Its a great app I could listen any song I wanted its really amazing but the only problem is the add you will have to listen adds more than songs its horrible please do something about that add,4
"App is broken with newest update. Spoke with Tebro Z through the web support messaging system and after going through the usual suggestions, was told the issue has been sent to devs. Will update review if/when issue is fixed.",1
It's okay but to many ads and they are long,4
It needs to work offline 😒,1
"i can't login because everytime i tried to login, it always says that i'm offline, when i'm not. i turned on my mobile data. isn't there any solution for this problem? it's really bugging me",3
I would have done it a zero but that's not possible so I give you a 1 it won't let me restart my password because I'm on infant I'm on infinite Shuffle I'm having a mental breakdown about it and I hope your company gets bankrupt 🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲,1
"Adds are too much, would have subscribed the premium version but they charge too much.. at least lesser the adds",2
Good.. I can listen to my favorite music really easy.,5
Nice layout and some good suggestions,5
This app is horrible I tried to make an account with my when I was born but it's not working I think they need to work on this cuz I'm just doing what I have to do I wanted to test it out and listen to some music not on YouTube and it's horrible utterly horrible I don't understand how people will like this but I will not recommend this,1
Love the quality and availability of my favourite by a push of a button,5
Best place for podcasts,5
Very hard to use and why must i have extra music in my playlist that i don't want,1
"Recently, today I could not play my liked songs, all it does is play songs I've not even seen nor heard of, and I'm starting to get angry.edit:it has been a few weeks now and it still does this, it won't stop, I try to play song from my Playlist, but it goes and play I don't have on it, and it is just so stupid, I can't believe your famous business is failing this badly to give the user what they want.",2
"Can pick music I like, don't get anything don't want",5
Great app to listen to music on...10/10 would definitely recommend,5
Give thousand ad one after song 😡🤬 i like that why you intrued app for ad only know why you that music change your name and set spotify play thouand ad and podcasts,1
This app is so nice i listen my fav song and my fav artist i follow them i like spotify so much Thank you spotify,5
"Very excellent app, it gives me the collection of my pet music, thanx spotify.",4
I like the fact that you can find so much music but there is sooo much to dislike like the fact that I can't choose what to listen to and every thing is shuffled and I can't listen to whatever I want and if I put one music in a playlist to listen to it They add music out of no where its annoying,1
"I found an asian language song that had been searching for a year since ain't knew the language,but finally found it through Spotify 😍🤩 using another app. Giving 5 star🤩🤩😻😻😻",5
Should also include downloading so that we could use it offline(free of cost).,4
"It would be great if App supports a feature to add a song as ”Play Next"". Apart from that it was Top Class.",4
"Excellent variety of music tracks, nothing you search you can't find ! I love this app",5
I am a collage student and i can't afford premium even after the discount and I get it that it is trying to push its customers towards buying premium but the number of ads are getting outrageous nowadays. Mocking your free user isn't going to get them buy premium it will just push them away. It has now become an app which is just insensitive towards poor people,1
Thumbs up for this app! Easily download any songs that I want and it's good for sharing.,5
exelente play list and sound quality awesome 😍😍,5
"Awsm app 🔥🔥 It shows all lofi songs also, it's great 👍👍 & Also unplugged album song ♥️♥️",5
I love spotify so much it is awesome!!!,5
Too many bugs on my phone,1
I love it. I get to explore different podcasts I hear about.,5
Songs ok but lyrics worst then expected.totally lost of read,1
I don't mind it but it's annoying when you can't choose your own song and have to sit through a list you can only skip six times.,5
Without money . . . .Too much adds. After every song there is add.,1
Easy and clear to use for music. Don't listen to Joe Rogan. I use Spotify everyday I love it.,5
"Spotify changed my whole world after my son told me about it years ago. What? They have full albums? They have albums from the 70's?? Tears were shed as I would have a musical memory, do a quick search, and bam! The Best of Bread, Twin Sons of Different Mothers, Rumours --it doesn't get any better than this. Totally worth it people.💗💗💗",5
Last update ruined playback. Pocast keeps stopping for no reason.,1
I feel like there's a new update every other day. Whenever I got to use the app it either closes itself or just doesn't play music. Then I checked and.... surprise... another update. Sometimes I don't have the time to download the update and so I just have to be music less. So annoying.,3
"This app used to give zero ad experience earlier. But it's condition is worse after these updates. So, what about those who want less ads without premium?",3
"When you pay its 5 starts easy, but if you dont then it's literally the worst app and you may aswell download soundcloud",3
It is a very good music app to use,5
I am unable to login in it and i tried all accounts,1
This app Is very nice.It's do Good Work I am an army.I listen BTS SONGS I LOVE TO LISTEN BTS SONGS or sabse achi baat muhhe yeh lagi is app ke bare mai Ki songs ke sath mai lyrics bhi aate hai.I am satisfied with this app💜💜,5
Hey the ads really sucks man i cant afford premium so dont i have right to get good music expwrience i am not asking you to make spotify ads free but the service is really bad i am listening a song then an ad then another song then again ad🥵😭😡,1
I literally can't even open the app and I don't know why but I used it before. It's just the Spotify logo screen.,1
I had an excellent experience. Love the Reggae music. They are my mood and fitness companions.,5
Absolutely love spotify,5
Would be a 5 but to many ads even with membership. The podcast are even getting worse like JRE Love the show but hate the ads,4
Easy to use and a ton of songs,5
"I love Spotify. It's so easy to use, I have my life playlist wherever I go.",5
"Some of my fav songs like coke studio season 9 tera woh pyar ,afreen afreen ..not available on my app...so a bit disappointed",4
It is a good music listening app i love the interface and everything. But please add the option to change audio quality on wear os. It is so much worse.,4
FARKIN WOW LOVE THIS APP not a song me or my friends and family have not been able to find over 12 months member and loving it. THANK YOU,5
Nice and gentle play songs...,5
Can't log into my account that I want to cancel subscription,2
Pretty good app.I love it shuffle mode and I recommend it 👌,4
Super music playing app,5
It's a good app it has all the death metal I listen to. My only problem is why the hell do have to go offline to listen to downloaded music. And I have a 5g phone and it always says I'm offline unless I'm on WiFi and I pay for it. That's why I given one star,1
It's better than the other available music apps and I like some of the features and suggestions but it isn't Google Play Music and I miss it,4
"App crashing of recently , and the search bar gets masked partially by the top indicator panel of the ui , in pixel 4a",4
I listen to old time radio programs while working and walking...great app!!,5
It is great but too many adds,4
Excellent music source even in free mode,5
I find any songs I'm looking for thank you,5
Good apps for someone who love music because it have a lot of good music☺️,5
I like to listen the songs,5
"Unplayed filter hides unplayed downloaded episodes. Constantly disconnects from ear buds requiring closing and reopening app. Also will sometimes take ages to download tracks. We're talking dialup speed. Also, will not work with Bluetooth with lots of restarts. Such a shame",1
It's one of my favorite apps on any type of electronic,5
Uninstalled and reinstalled but can't remember my password. Keep getting a link sent to my email but the link just takes me back to put my password in again which obviously I can't remember. Surely there must be a way to reset it?,4
Stupid app won't let me play certain specific songs it's always on shuffle play without premium,1
Very nice experience it amuses me when I listen to music form spotify,5
"sometimes it's take time for loading , By the way it's Nice app 👍🏻",4
I accidentally deleted the app and for the past few days I am trying to download it and I can't I tried downloading another app thinking it would've been a problem in my phone or playstore but no the app was downloaded easily only Spotify is not please fix it.,1
Recommended songs. Stop. It's annoying,2
"easy and simple,",5
Luv the ability to pick from so many genres of music. It just fits Any mood I'm in.,5
Hate that random songs can just come next when playing a specific album from my country. But it's a good app. Not too many ads. Love that,3
"I love this premium feature but in our country it takes lot of taxes from tele communication service, so Spotify should use nagad payment method",5
"""Music to my ears"" Awesome!! Soooo Cool! 🙂🙂👍👍",5
i love the app but whenever i open it i see the logo and it doesnt load anymore i uninstalled it and installed it a bunch of times and i dont know what to do anymore,2
"Update 30/06/22 - I've been a Premium user now since October '21 and it has been an awesome ride of discovery and rediscovery across the musical spectrum for me! If you have the change, try out Spotify and you won't regret it because it's worth every penny in my view. There are plenty of lesser known artists in this that mainstream is absolutely clueless about which is good of Spotify to include in their catalogue. At £9.99 it's like paying for access to the biggest record collection ever!",5
Very nice music app I love it so much 💞,5
"Thank you for returning back normal position of media control buttons. Please, avoid this kind of experiments in the future.",5
Won't work on my phone tried everything deleting app ect sign out of all accounts... no customer service...bummer,1
it wont let me log back in ive been trying for so long and i cant get back in,3
Spotify ad every 2 songs just make it 5 or 6 songs,1
"Why can't subscription be controlled from the app, just like YouTube music and other platforms?",3
Absolutely the best app for listening music podcast and ..... the best choice is Spotify ✌🏻,5
"Today, i tried to switch my account but then i can't even go to the login interface. Forever in loading logo. I also tried to re-install but still the same. I may changed my rating if they fixed this but now I can't use it.",1
I don't like it so many ads after every one song.... This not suitable for who not purchase premium...,2
I enjoy this App. It has so many options and is easy to use,5
"The app's great! Just like I heard it. Infact, it had almost all the musics and podcasts I just needed.. All I had an issue with is this - When a playing song ends, the 'notification' for the song disappears and the next song doesn't play.. I've recently updated Spotify but it doesn't work, I manually need to change the song each time one ends (Which gets annoying when we are gaming or being on Social medias). Please fix this.",4
"Very awesome, allows you to listen to worship music without any interuptions and still has minimal ads",5
"As a fan of listening to Korean, Japanese and Chinese Songs, i would greatly appreciate it when you consider incorporating a ""ROMANIZED"" version to your lyrics' section esp. for those people (including me) who likes to sing along with the song/s. Please consider this for your next update. Thank you!",3
"I'm ashamed that Spotify is bowing to the Cancel Culture. On top of that, all of the ""news"" podcasts are extremely left wing. Just tell me what's going on in the world and let me make up my own mind.",1
Its the best music app ever but the only thing is that i need internet to play music,4
"If you plan on paying to avoid ads and listen to podcasts or anything other than music, DO NOT BUY SPOTIFY. with the rising of people adding in content ads and such makes premium obsolete. They constantly try popping open some info on car mode while I'm driving which is a hazard. This app Is really really going down the drain. Just use apple music or Dropout TV. Or anything else really.",1
Why did my filters in Liked Songs disappeared after I reinstalled the app?,5
Good no glitches every song mood freshing albums and every thing that you would ever want,5
Smart phone ready or compatible unlike realplayer.,5
"This app is just superb... there is only one suggestion, when I opened this app it automatically started playing songs which I've heard last time... other than this... everything is good. I really loved that this app contains podcast... Thank you Spotify.",5
Can't scroll through the genres and the genre selection got way worse. If this app wasn't the best one around I wouldn't even use it but that's what happens when 1 company owns virtually the whole market,2
I love this app . I am using this more than 2 years sound quality is awsome,5
it was a good app but recently like the past 2 months i cant edit or even see my playlists its so annoying and it dont even play them or my podcasts idk what happened but i really dont like it,2
Some songs disapear from my playlist. And NO it is not the artist removing them from Spotify library as they are still available to add manually again.,1
EDIT: SOUND QUALITY STILL SUCKS.,1
"Till you can't play offline mode,it fraud",1
Best music app ever,5
"I get to listen to my favorite music but I don't wanna listen to other stuff because I know what I like to listen to, and I don't like what Spotify recomends, and the skips are limited for some dumb reason, so I either have to put up with the HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE music Spotify reccomends to me or use my skips. Spotify does not know my music tastes. (It recomends a ton of Brony stuff cause I like Someone Like Me and Ashes.)",2
I love your song app thank you to making this app,5
"I like the app very much nice playlists for every mood but problem is there is no option for the recently heard songs . So ,please add the option of recently heard by the update.",3
Only Spotify comfort's me,5
"Im paying for this and I still get ads. More and more. Not sure if its by the company or the podcasters, but its country specific, so its not a built-in ad. Even if its by the podcasters, you should not allow this. I hope youll fix this.",1
It's good it's just ads and I'm having troubles getting my Playlist,2
Everything's fine except ads.,4
Spotify has a podcast for everyone's taste,5
"There's some issue with this app on my phone, it isn't getting opened, could you please assist",3
"It's good music but like LET ME LISTEN TO WHAT I WANT TO LISTEN TO, I PUT IT IN MY PLAYLISTS LET ME LISTEN TO THAT AND NOT SOME RANDOM SONG YOU MIXED IN WITH IT",2
Love it been using Spotify for like 6 years now 10/10,5
fantastic music but Why delete the SHUFFLE BUTTON Please bring it back,4
I love this app soo much.... it's my daily dose and i hope it's yours too,5
Very Bad App There Are Too Much Ads,2
i love spotify. Spotify make my happy I love you so much 💚,5
"They ""shuffle in"" too much of what they want you to hear",3
Good for English music abroad,4
"The music is great, but why can't I renew my subscription in Nigeria, it sucks because I have tried all the cards I have and yet it's declining the cards. Mind you it accepted the card when I initially started",4
Spotify is the good app for music,5
Great selection of music and easy to access.,5
how to make basic fried rice 3 cups cooked rice * 2 Tbs sesame oil. 1 small white onion chopped. 1 cup frozen peas and carrots thawed. 2-3 Tablespoons soy sauce more or less to taste. 2 eggs lightly beaten. 2 Tbsp chopped green onions optional.,5
"Easy to use, transparent app with all music you need.",5
Great application to my music world,5
"My fav app, can't do without it even for a day!",5
Its good till you are done listening because if you want to hear the song again spotify plays some random song even if i put it on my playlist it wont play because spotify keeps adding other songs and it keeps playing them instead of the song i want and i cant find a way to stop it,2
Would be great if lyrics could be displayed for all songs - not necessarily Genius,5
They stole my music up rf my phone I downloaded elsewhere noway of the return ing.. has happened so they know they do,1
Best app when it comes to music choice,5
What a lovely app of music heads off to this app maker or app maker team,5
I would give it 5 stars but it has increased the ads frequency between two songs,4
I basically live on spotify but sometimes I have to delete then reinstall it because the play/pause bar glitches.,4
One of the best App to download and listen music,5
"I like the choices that I had to choose from. It was easy to choose the app that I wanted,and use that app. Gina Guess",4
Excellent app with a huge selection of music from a broad range of genres.,5
Pls help I can NOT PLAY SELECTED SONG pls all I want is free music,1
Worst music and podcast app available Edit: 6/30/2022 (over a year later) This app accrossed all my devices is still absolutely horrible. If I rewind a podcast more than 15 seconds it goes into a buffering loop that never ends. On occasion if I get ads on a podcast it restarts any podcast I'm listening to then makes me listen to adds again at a random spot in the podcast. HIRE SOME ACTUAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS,1
UI is terrible + app doesn't even work half the time.,2
"Download for any particular song is not available, at home page ther is only playlists add some song too ........",3
Chose Spotify for the minimal user interface it has. Spotify makes syncing so easy across different OSs.,4
Worst application.samsung duos phone is faster than Spotify,1
I like it from the start but when I play my fav song and it ends it's plays random song update this pls,2
"I just wanna recommend adding the music search quality like ""Shazam"". The one where we can know a song name quicker",4
"It's good app for music lover ,specialty who use music when they work",4
"I just bought premium 2 days ago and since yesterday the app just won't open. I've tried everything: force stopping the app, uninstalling then reinstalling, removing then retaining permissions. But it just stays stuck on the logo when I try to open it. I'm not having my money poured down the drain on premium for something that won't even open! Is there a way I can recover the app properly? I'm on android. Thanks.",1
"Used to love this app.. the 30 minutes without interruption. good times. now it's an ad every 1-2 songs. I barely use this app anymore because of it. and when it says ""30 minutes without interruption"" it's actually just 4 songs then like 10 ads straight.",3
I love to sing so I love this decause there are not a lot of adds and you can listen to music and not be interpreted and listen to any song the song you love.,5
had only no song only hard,2
"It's a good app for listening music but it's too restricting, when i play my fav song it automatically played another song which is not in my playlist.",1
"It is really awesome ❤. Like so much better than the YouTube app. When I close yt, the song or video doesn't continue playing. It's because I am a tablet user. But Spotify is really awesome. If I close it the song still plays. It even asks you for your three fav artists and it makes you a mix by yr personality. Great music platform! Tap install already now! ❤😃",5
Actually the pc version is good you can atleast select between the songs in your playlist and in this app you can't even do that and when i play my playlist it automatically selects shuffle and sometimes it just playes a songs that is not even in my playlist a rubbish app deleting it.,1
"Good app, but lots of Add",4
Music is great even has some classics but it only lets you skip song 6 tims instead of as many times as you want and it dose not let you just listen to you're play list with out the suggested songs unless you have premium and it sucks.,3
"Hello! I'm new to Spotify and this is my first time using it. I'm loving it so far! I just have a few suggestions, 1. In the music player, we should be able to swipe down and up without having to use the arrow. 2. A double tap to seek for about 10 seconds would be really nice to add. 3. In the mini music player, we should be able to swipe down to get rid of it. 4. More animations when you click the pause and play button would make Spotify better. And 5. Sometimes the app will crash after opening",4
I cant even play the song i want it just shuffle to another song😡,1
It is an excellent music app,5
"I used to enjoy the app a lot more even though it's been glitchy and laggy from time to time but now I have to deal with advertisements every two songs, 3 if I'm lucky. And not just 1 or 2 ads but 3-4 ads and the same ones over and over again. So for every half an hour I listen I hear like 10+ ads and it gets old fast. When I skip a song or change channels it goes straight to ads again, so I feel stuck listening to something I don't want to so as to avoid the same ads yet again.",2
Worst app ever used. It has more adds than songs that we search for. Irritating adds force me to uninstall.,1
Great app but very annoying. I accidentally hit 'do not play again' because I wanted it to play on loop and now I cant play it no more and it really anoys me because this is the only app I can shut my phone off with,2
"Simply select the mood and you will be taken by it, so simple",5
"The app is really good, but I hate how how you have to shuffle to listen to playlist and not just pick a song you want to listen to, and how many ads there are. I get 9-10 ads before I can listen to a song. Or the song just gets skipped cause of “Internet connections” even though I'm connected to strong internet. Some times I hate how you need to pay for a offline playlist. Spotify is a really good app, but even though it has some pros, it has a lot more down sides to it.",2
Nice application for song lover.,4
Sometimes there's an annoying bug… It closed by itself or just stop playing,4
Great variety of music,5
Great human story - great interview where the interviewer draws an amazing story from Jay Gaffey - looking forward to Pt 2,5
very good with all types of music to suit everyone.,5
Best way to hear pure way of music and huge collection,5
Thanks for making ads unskippable out of nowhere so you f me up while traveling on the road. I will never buy anything I hear from a Spotify ad because I can't skip.,1
Finally got Spotify Premium and it's worth it. No more annoying ads and so many features. The price is reasonable to be fair. I just love it.,5
"Never had an app that literally ignores my imput... garbage. I search a song I want to listen to, listen to the ad then guess what... It plays sum bs not even related to the artist or song I want to hear. Okay no big deal I'll just skip it then... NOPE ANOTHER IRRELEVANT song I didn't ask for until I have no skips left and it never attempted to play the song or artist I wanted. Again... garbage",1
One suggestion: Add shuffle and repeat buttons to the mini player in lock screen,5
"When i search for an artist and get in their profile, only 5 or 6 songs are displaying.",3
This app contains no songs from இணைந்த கைகள் movie in tamil movie and many other tamil movie song,1
I love music and you gave it to me.... THANKS........,5
Unable to unhide songs,3
"Spotify been a best platform for me,keep it up guys",5
"So every week on my release radar, spotify keeps putting a random artist from a genre that i never listen to, but the song has one of bands i listen a lot tagged as a associated artist even though they aren't. For example the song: ""UTOPIA-Abridged"" by Harper Minta, Aer, Blu, and the odd ball Avatar. Which is a swedish heavy-death metal band...",4
Too many commercials after first 30 minutes.,3
I think that the app is great it works well and has atleast 99% of the songs I like saying I'm a k-pop fan but it glitches pretty often I don't know if it happens to other people too but it happens for me quite often please fix this.,4
Paid for premium and I'm still getting advertising,1
This app is amazing for listening music,5
"Best new music engine, lots of o scu trax. Where's Anne now?",5
Simply put.. Spotify > every other music stuff you know,5
The commercials are atrocious.,1
Very happy with Spotify's music.,5
"Excellent!!! Always my go to for sleeping, walking, meditating or just enjoying",5
Just one suggestion: I've created my own Playlist and everything is fine but when I've shared it with my friends they aren't getting shuffle option for the playlist. Same problem I've experienced with many other Playlists. Please provide the shuffle option for all Playlists and if it's a bug then resolve it.,4
"Autoolay problem. I've disabled the setting, but spotify still plays songs that are suggested instead of the actual songs that are in my Playlist. I have premium though, it's just straight up dogshit. Use youtube instead.",1
love Spotify so much,5
I con't find defferent -defferent language songs on this app:::,3
I love Spotify it's great music all the time anywhere i go i got my music very easy to use just add the songs you love and start listening,5
Awesome sound quality...,4
App is very very nice song,5
Awesome music application,5
"Recommend songs when I play my liked songs jeez, all I want to do is listen to my liked songs, not recommend useless songs.",1
Way too many ads,4
"Wonderful, until the layout changes randomly, removes my ability to see the queue, or stops showing what music I'm playing. Acts up a bunch. I have auto-updates on, too :/",3
"Music is my life, and i honestly don't know where I'd be without it. I've downloaded so many apps to stream music but none of those apps come anywhere close to being as good as Spotify. Not only does it have any and every artist album and song you could think of but Spotify is always looking to find ways to keep the consumers happy and satisfied.",5
It's ok but I wish there was an option for them to recommend music in you playlist I wish you could turn it on or off,2
The best music app ever,5
"It has been a corner stone in my phone, at least now I have something that can ease up the tension. Spotiy is really an amazing app which I'll recommend to every person that passes an eye through it; don't hesitate to download it and give it a shot.",5
Too much ad cant tolerable,1
I found all my related songs at one place. Recommended.,5
"Love Spotify it is worth every penny. I like that I can take my music everywhere I got with no enteruptions. You can find all kinds of stuff in the app to, not just music.",5
I'm getting fed up with Spotify. Even though I have almost 2000 liked songs it plays the same hundred or so when on shuffle. To the point where I end up unliking some of my favorite songs so they don't get over played. I want a shuffle option where songs are not repeated until all songs have been played. And it should be able to keep track of what's been played over multiple days. Also wish the algorithm could recognize a genre I play infrequently and not change my recommendations.,2
It has a lot of choices but it will pause my song mid way through or restart it.,5
Very large selection of music I like being able to select albums,5
"Updating Spotify is risky. With the last few iterations, podcast downloads take forever because they keep restarting from 0%",3
It was a good experience having spotify. It gives a lot of energy and hype when I have it and it makes me more love music because somehow it is my comfort care for myself. All in all its very good.,5
I love this app except for the fact that there are constant ads. I know that's just a way for the developers to get people to buy premium but it's just infuriating.,2
"Every song is available, & best interface among others.",5
"I have been using the app since 5 years now, and frankly, it is a good app. But these days there are many problems with the app. Though I have purchased the premium package, I am not able to listen to the songs I want, or search for any song. It says something went wrong, or no internet connection. I waited for more than a year for the issue to get fixed. If this continues, I dont think I will renew my premium package anymore. There is no point since I cant listen to any songs.",1
Only plays shuffle. Spotify sux,1
Good buffet of songs.,5
The app has been working for me sense 2019 and its pretty good but unfortunately when i go to daily mix it shuffles the playlists with songs that arent in that mix and yes i refreshed and swiped off the app and reopening it but it still stayed on shuffle mode even if i reinstalled it its still on shuffle so i don't know if its an update or a unfixable glitch,5
too bad cant play songs bad update,2
Love listening to the music but when I get 6 ads IN A ROW I kinda get irritated,2
I WANT TO SKIP AND LISTEN BUT THE OPTION IS LIMITED OTHER THAN THAT I L9VE IT,4
good and very easy to used app,5
Everything is great... no doubt...but Why do uh always show ads after saying no ads for 30 minutes 😒😒😒,3
Stuck at shuffle .. no button to undo it ..,1
"Editing playlists, making playlists, and even playing songs are a chore using this app. The ui can use alot of work, and the fact that so many necessary features are locked behind premium make it so much more aggravating. The only reason I still use this app are the huge library of songs it contains",1
Very bad I got continuously 4 ads ...😢 Around 1 min there must be some limit on ads you can't show it however you want I only listen music on Spotify. But this disappoints me.😢😢,2
I forgot my password and Google didn't save it. I tried to reset it and it doesn't work. If paying for it I shouldn't have sny problem with resetting a new password,1
It is an amazing app😎 .....🤔first you download then you can see🤫 how the app is working......🥰🥰,4
Best music experience you can have,5
Its not workinh i have the best network and it says no internet connection plz fix ittt,1
Some one is using my Spotify! I cannot get him out from Vietnam! I will lose all the music I have 466 songs!No one can help me I have no choice but to DELETE all my songs!,1
Exceptionally super duper app! The best!!! Julio Blanco.,5
More ads than songs If you want to experience all types of advertisements more than songs just download without premium...if you want more songs than ads then go for Jio saavn,1
Feature are very friendly quality is best,5
"I have had Spotify for a week so far its excellent, plays all the good music l want to hear.",5
My problem is that i chose a song and it sends me to another song I don't want and i am pretty sure that is for premium but seriosly premium to stop shuffling,3
I wish that you could choose whether or not you want spotify to add to your playlists... I personally hate it... I made the playlist with certain songs in it... I don't need more songs added... maybe you could recommend those songs to be added but you just adding them makes my playlists useless and there was no point in me making it if you were just going to change it,2
Love using Spotify it's just I hateeeee the ads but I don't wanna have to pay just to get rid of them other than that I love everything about it.,4
Good music app but worst irritating adds Avery song play after add comes,1
All Songs Are Available and Simple play,5
"Spotify is not functioning properly at all. For almost a week I keep getting ""Something went wrong. Check internet connection and try again."" Anytime I click to go anywhere. Tried reinstalling. Tried looking the issue up. Nothing. No fix. Im stuck using Iheartradio because I cant play anything through Spotify.",1
Absolutely 💯 love Spotify!!! I like the songs it plays for different Music genre!!! Some of those you love but have forgotten about that's what I love about Spotify!!! Leaves you very satisfied and warms my heart with all the old music I listened to growing up!,5
A idea for Spotify: Imagine being able to choose the years of your favorite singers activities and just listen to the period of songs produced in those years. I hope can see this option soon in the Spotify,5
Allows me to play some songs that I want to listen for free and I can listen while my phone is off,5
"I Use It EVERYDAY, Throughout The Whole Day And I Am Truly Appreciative If It. Thank You.",5
"This app is probably the best music app I ever used. One thing I hate is the point how You can't Download without premium, I think it's really Dumb if you ask me, AND There's no point of downloading if You have premium Because You can Listen offline-",4
I have been using Spotify for 3 years .It's wonderful.,5
this app sucks. i cant choose which song i want to listen to.the playlist just plays. there are limited skips. hate this app.,1
"Great all my favorite music, comedians, and podcasts. I have one complaint that Spotify is not connecting with my clock app but I assume that's nothing to do with Spotify.",5
Charge to much for nit being able to merge with booster sppd,1
Inspitr of that good app for songs,5
A good repotire of musicians. Great!,5
"Spotify picks random times to update what I assume are my downloaded playlists every day, but it keeps getting stuck at 95-97% unless I manually open and then force close the app. Update: been over a month and still no fix. Dropping down to one star.",1
"Very happy with Spotify so far,I'm a new user,really like the service 👍",4
If they had a Spotify make this be the best app that makes it push the haters back in their seat keep doing great and be yourself they will hate but you will be you in the end,5
Best music app EVVERRR!!!!!,5
Talk about the best app ever you deserve to listen to that inner rockstar...... You can unwind from life here👍👍👍👍,5
Easy great music selections clear what more do you want????,5
"app no longer opens, just freezes even after uninstalling and reinstalling",1
It always gives me the wrong songs,3
App won't even start. I'm in a perpetual load screen no matter how many times I do a clean install.,1
Sound is very clear and no issues,5
"This app is going down hill. Can't even play music if I want to put it in my playlists anymore, Can't play music to see if that's the song I'm searching for. What the hell are the ads for if you can't use any features",1
Starts to lag and skip anytime I add too many songs to the queue,3
Had to completely nuke the app and associated files twice to get it mostly working again. Even after a clean reinstall it has trouble picking up an internet connection. At least my downloaded music actually works now.,1
10 outta 10 I wouldn't change a thing Spotify is amazing 🙌,5
Stop those ads,4
"Basically it's ""ADSTIFY"" I've been experiencing this ""7ads and 1 song"" so disappointing",1
"I Love ,the next time I go sit on my porch, I can listen to my own picks.",5
More ads on Spotify,3
Awesome experience! Excellent sound quality!,5
I wish they had there own radio station so you could listen to played songs,3
It's pretty good service if you know what you're doing,5
To many ads hate it although listening to music is that I love is great just calm down with the ads I be on YouTube to listen to my music if I get annoyed with the ads,5
This is one the most amazing apps I've ever had but one thing I would like to see change is how many playlists you can pin 📌 in your library. Otherwise nothing! Flawless and amazing! 100% recommend.,5
"Music is perfect, podcasts are great idea for great information",5
"Long time subscription holder, I'd like to see that ability to store downloaded files on an SD card. It's consuming all my available space on my tablet",4
"Everything's very fine, but there are alot of ads for those who don't have Premium. Two songs and again ads. So umm, make it a little less? :)",4
"I'm a premium family acct owner. I logged out my main account on my mobile phone app and spotify never opened again. It would just stay on its logo. I tried troubleshooting - clear cache, clear data, force stop, even updating/reinstalling it did not work! Please fix it.",1
"Didnt care for Spotify at 1st.. BUT ONCE I learned how it worked I FREAKING LOVED IT!! I love how it somewhat ""Learns"" the user & makes Playlist for the user on a day to day basis. It also keeps you up to date with other songs new & old! DEFINITELY WORTH DOWNLOADING! I also like how you can use Spotify & also do other things on your device without it ever Interrupting your JAMZ! Oh yeah, also if you have Premium, you can download music and use even when you have ""No Service* #UseItDaily",5
Excellent app! You can make your own playlist of your favorite singer!,5
Why is it that the volume always get turned down automatically when it's on 100%. There aren't any settings to change this either. I'm canceling my premium if this doesn't get fixed,2
"Doesn't have everything I was looking for, but it has way more than I was expecting.",5
Not working properly,1
I hate it when I play a song it's different song you should fix it !!!!!!! Or your fans will be so angry !!!!!!,1
"""This app is absolute garbage for listening to podcasts"" was my last review. But I was wrong. I was being hot-headed and not understanding correctly. I do apologize to the owners of this app. It works really well.",5
"Is just awesome, can't live without my Spotify.",5
I love Spotify because you get to play music and you can listen to anything on it so that's why l love Spotify.spotify is my favourite thing to listen to music and songs on it.😍😍😍😍😘😘💯💯💯💯👿,5
I was paying for the same thing I get from Spotify. Will never leave! Spotify also recommend like selections I may not have thought of,5
I listen to lots of good music and podcasts for free,5
Great games having fun trying to win our billions well i haven' lost yet great games ilove slots,5
"I LOVE spotify! I very rarely have any problems but I'm seriously getting annoyed since the last update. The app will open to a black screen with the symbol and stay there. I have tried all the tips on the user community. Including batter optimizing settings, permissions and a clean reinstall and still will not work. Please help! I pay the ridiculous fee for premium family. I don't want to cancel my subscription and move to something else. I will change my review when fixed.",1
"Amazing, just amazing.",5
UI issues are back in full force,2
This is the best the only problem I had with it it is when I like I want to listen to a song like what I'm doing the dishes or something you don't need to know sometimes it would disconnect from my headset but other than that it's fine I love it,5
Love that they have any music that you want to here. I couldn't do without my play list,5
"At first this app was the best but now because of the new update that we can't listen to our specify favourite song and play randomly. Same thing happens in playlist,there is no song name but only text about the writer and song name. This update i didn't like and so I am giving it 3 stars for that.",3
Premium too expensive.,3
Unusable without premium. Feels like a version of Itunes from 2004 with how primitive it is without premium. Don't waste your time.,1
Love this app. I love controlling my TV. It's just frustrating sometimes to edit Playlist from the phone.,5
I'm using the app on a new device and I'm using it online with a strong consistent wifi connection but it refuses to play the full songs in my Playlists. The playlists look just as if they would offline because I don't have the premium. It didn't do this before on my other devices and it's seriously annoying. It also has the same bugs everyone else is complaining about on my other devices. What I experienced is the app pausing my music randomly. I've re-installed this app 3 times now.,2
"Every time I restart the phone it changes my storage location from sd card to internal and starts redownloading. Highly annoying. Edit: Reduced review to 1 star, since they won't fix it.",1
"I've been using spotify for a few years now and I love it. Premium is fairly cheap, and the app quality is spectacular. There are a few glitches. But overall spotify is my go to!",5
Keeps pausing randomly for no reason,1
Good and easy to use,4
Loving every moment listing to my favourite music 🎵,5
"It works really good when I listen to it through my head band and through my tablet. Even when I am in an area with no wifi, it still works great. (This is me a little bit after this review) I don't know what happened, but a band called night shift productivity is no where on Spotify anymore. Even the songs I had are gone. I don't know if this is your fault Spotify, but I'm giving you a 1 star review.",1
The music is phenomenal!!!,5
Not sure what is going on but automatic opening is aggravating...THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP... ANNOYED‼️,3
This app is easy to use the problem is with the interface. AI should be capable of picking a larger variety of songs instead of the top 100 in each playlist. If you make your own playlist it's great but if you listen to the daily mixes it's almost all the same songs in a different order in each list.,3
"Love this app, listen to all my music on here great playlists .....Recommend to anyone !",5
"No problems , great app",5
"If you love music, you'll love Spotify",5
This is rubbish can't even listen the song u choose this deserve 0 starts,1
"For years I used to love me some Spotify. Now it's infuriating. I can't even control to the point where I can't even skip songs, go back, choose playlists. It says I'm offline when I'm sitting next to my high speed router. I'm uninstalling and reinstalling now. Not optimistic. Update: All good, problem solved",4
"20220629 Update... still sucks. Have to unistiall, reinstall app often. Stops playing very frequently, can't use lock screen controls.",1
Genre tab in liked music is broken,1
Amazing interface and very easy to use.,5
"I think Spotify is a high-quality app and if you are looking for a high-quality music app this is the one. you can like songs, make playlists and enjoy. P.S follow me on Spotify",5
I cant play the music i want because it is on shuffling and i had to re-download it and it is still doing the same thing. And now i dont know what to do,1
"It's just barely not 5 stars, there are often technical issues and if you miss a payment by a few days they'll take the downloaded music off your phone with no warning. Otherwise no other music app is like it",4
They ruined it you can only skip 6 times and you can't even see what song is going to play next!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡,1
I never expected to find greatest music 🎶! Thank,5
"Love love love. My favorite app for music. I have a recommendation or two. It would be super cool if you could create easier ways to organize music to playlists. Like creating four boxes that you can personalize. One for podcasts, for artists, for songs, etc. Something where you could add playlists in. It would also be awesome if there was a + you could click on when you want to add a song to a playlist(or playlists) while on the lock screen. Thankss",5
So far so good. I've never had a problem or complaint with this app.,5
Almost each and every song I can think of is here.,5
"Fantastic,amazing selection of all typs of music",5
This is the best music app ever,5
Great app but I don't want shuffle to repeat songs in a playlist till the whole playlist has been played.,4
"I have to say. I do love spotify. Never been bothered to give an app a rating, unless it was rubbish. But Spotify is great.",5
App never works right. I pay for premium and still get ads.,1
The app likes to randomly stop and close when using. It would be great otherwise. 2 stats since it constantly closes on me everyday throughout the day.,2
Oh my goodness it is really nice cz you get every music you want 🤍🤍,5
I had a very good experience until now but Spotify robbed my money when I paid for the premium subscription and I didn't get the premium account activated after the successful payment and I still haven't received my refund back all they say is that they didn't receive the payment which was successfully from my side. Don't subscribe for premium with UPI they will rob you.,1
Great app especially for podcasts. Only reason I'm not giving five stars is because it can be very very slow sometimes.,4
"I hope this app fixes itself because I am really not happy with the results. In the free plan, you get SIX skips an hour. Which means you have to sit through songs you hate or dont want to here at the time. You cant pick a song and play it, which is really bad for picking a song you want to watch. And one of the most annoying things is that it will ADD RANDOM SONGS TO YOUR PLAYLISTS. THIS DOES NOT WORK. HOW BSREBONES CAN YOU EVEN KEEP A FREE VERSION. Never spend a penny on this app. Use audity.",1
If I'm paying for Ad free it should apply to podcasts too.,2
Great app clear and crisp sound 👌,5
Please allow premium subscription to be paid by Google Play Store balance as it is in other apps.,5
"App was fine until I purchased premium membership. Free version shoes ads after every 30 minutes which is okay but when I purchased Premium subscription for a day to try premium, ads popped up after every 2 songs which was like 5-7 minutes. At first I thought it'd be a glitch but even after relaunching the app same thing happened which spoiled party ridiculously. I am glad I din't purchase monthly or yearly package. Whoever thinking to buy premium membership, DON'T GO FOR IT AT ALL. TRY GAANA.",1
I love Spotify I can find old country music that I grew up listening to. My parents were musicians. I'm a die hard old country music fan. Don't like the new stuff. I'm 80 yrs old. I Absolutely love Waylon Jennings forever. He's the Man along with Willie Nelson. I love all old country NOT the new stuff!,5
"App is a Memory HOG. It runs slow on all devices. No ability it ""Down rate anything"". This is balanced by search Anything and find. App has changed it's shape a few times and NO option to use a different layout.",3
*edit: so many features are broken and don't work. Getting worse Great except the podcast player is not as good as others (deleting downloads already listened to/sorting) Recently offline mode is horrible to use. Songs and I have downloaded won't play/are greyed out and say internet is not available. If I reconnect to wifi all my downloads become available next time I disconnect. A day without internet will cut my downloads out. Very frustrating when cellular data or internet is not easy to get.,1
"Great Stufft It's, my kind of music so far keep rocking.",5
My premium doesnt work and i tried everything already but it wont work.,2
Disappearing controls are making this app unusable. It also ignores my setting to not resume playing automatically (I NEVER WANT THIS-- WHO DOES?!) I've been waiting for over a year for these to be fixed and nothing. Another android dev team failing to bother testing their own app!,1
They provide good quality music and entertainment.,5
"You give me 3 unskippable ads and then play songs that aren't even in my playlist, CONSECUTIVELY. I used all my skips and never even got to any of the songs that WERE in my playlist. Seriously? Why should I subscribe when this is the BS I get?",1
Awesome app love it to bits...,5
the music i like it.,5
Love commercials? Love hearing a short ad that will allow 30 minutes of commercial free music? Too bad!!! The commercial never ends!! Turn it off and reopen? Wrong!! Same commercial!!!!! Gets worse everytime I use it!!! Do not use!!!!,1
App functions well on both phone and chromebook,5
"When the ads start outnumbering the songs, that's a problem. Uninstalled.",1
Amazing app ❤️ I loved it this is so good for songs thank you for this amazing app I'm happy ❤️😊,5
"Idk what's going on but I like this song called ""gverment hooker (sped up) "" and whenever I try to play it, it either says ""song is not available "" or it just skips to the next song on my playlist. Fix this please.",3
"I listened to a podcast with Nancy Grace, I've missed her, she's on a different channel now. Still a great speaker and trying to put killers behind bars for years.",5
"Good app runs smooth, thanks for your service Spotify.",5
I like it better then YouTube premium it keeps your music and not have to redownload your music every couple of days.,4
It's is wonderful to have access to music at anytime and by your favourite artist. It is so clear and great. Just completely love it.,5
"i usually love this app, but its been buggy as of late. if my phone is in landscape mode, it wont flip anymore. songs repeat in my library after an hour or so. sometimes it just stops playing. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but nothing fixes it. whatever was in this last update really messed something up",5
"Your is broken, I can't like songs anymore please fix it",1
"It's an amazing experience to have majority songs on a music platform - online and offline both! However, it would be great if Spotify could take suggestions for missing songs, which users would like to be made available.",4
I can search any Playlist with less internet,5
I like the quality of songs,5
I'm unable to login to the app at all. I keep getting the message something went wrong try again. I'm currently in my 15th try.,1
"The app is great but there are some problems, some really famous songs are not included such as still with you of jungkook and there is another problem that of u wanna read lyrics of a song it comes is in the samee language as the song for example if u wanna listen to a Korean song the lyrics will be in Korean and u can't translate it into English but other then that it's a great app and I definitely recommend it I hope my advice helped byeeee",4
"When they roll out the HI-RES Audio option they will get 5 stars, before than it's just 3.",3
Great app tons of music,5
I love using this app just I want to close the app tab and play the music but otherwise l love it its great it has podcasts and plenty of music and its not to hard to find a song they also reccommend good songs for you its really nice! 10/10,5
The got rid of the slide to queue song option for literally no reason,2
"Accidentally deleted my old review. I have been a Premium user since day one. Last year (21) Spotify had some serious issues, but it's back on track. Spotify remains the best music streaming platform.",5
I found my favorite songs and bands,4
Listen to it every day almost all night long if I could best music app ever,5
"There are a number of features I like, they include: 1) Replaying a song you like without having to listen to ads. 2) Synchronized highlighting of lyrics. 3) Including lessor known singers while listening to a genre like ""Classic Rock"". 4) I love the fact Spotify works outside the US unlike some other streaming services. 5) When you select an specific group the suggested groups you might like are very nicely curated!",4
The only reason why I give it 4 and not 5 is because it adds to many songs to my playlist and it doesn't give me enough skips to skip them so I get stuck listening to songs that I don't like and that I never even heard,4
Love this app I play music almost every minute of the day,5
Wow! nice but I can't download any music,4
"App has suddenly become horribly unstable. Frequently, a new song will start, but the notification won't update. When this happens, the app will only open as a black screen and the only way to stop music is to force stop the app. Have tried all the usual troubleshooting, cleared data, reinstalled, etc. but this still happens almost every time i listen to music with the app.",5
The best app ever I would totally recommend it to a lot of people love you Spotify,5
"I'm not sure if it's just my app but it's beyond a joke now. My friends say they get 1 or 2 ads in between songs when I get 4+, I've even had 7 ads in a row!! Please fix this, it's incredibly annoying and I don't have the money for premium",3
Been trying tp get the premium pack but neither the system let me do it.1,3
The app has all the original version of the songs,5
Great app with a very good sound quality. Works great with my voice assistant too which is a bonus,4
"I hear my friends talking about spotify , how good it is this app to listen any kind of music , I'm a Salsa music fan and you didn't hear this music in the radio station anymore .so I download this app and I'm so happy to play anytime the Salsa music that I love to hear !!!",5
Love spotify. Only change I'd have is to be able to reorder my playlists easily. I've added whole albums to my playlist before but don't want them to be all in a row. If there was a way to permanently shuffle the list that would be awesome!!,5
"Spotify is nice and all but when ever I try to play a song I want to play it plays another song that is similar to the one I want to hear, I never get to listen to the actual songs I want to listen to and it's kind of annoying",2
Pretty easy to use and organized UI/UX,5
Only problem i've encountered that actually bothers me is the cut down lyrics. A lot of songs have missing words and that kinda sucks.,5
showing break after a every song because u want that users take your premium account by getting frustrated of seeing ads. Worst app!! They interupt after every song by showing ads and say after every ad enjoy the next 30 minutes without interuption 🤯,1
There are numerous stability issues with the app in June 2022.,2
This is the worst app that I have ever used. I can hear ads after playing 2 to 3 songs even though we don't want to buy the premium the ads are increasing day by day and I am sure that this strategy will lose a lot of customers and I am sure that you have got 4.3 ratings and it is going to turn into 3 very soon,1
It's so good These are all song which you want,5
Controls keep disappearing so I can't stop music or podcasts without forcing the app to stop. Happens again I'll switch.,2
Vvvv poor. Soo much ads. Didn't liked much. Mood spoiler 👎👎,1
"one word, Fantastic.",5
It's a really good music app u til your free trial is over and nothing works until you buy something,4
If you are a free user you can't skip a song after 6 songs??? I get it for the other features but skipping a song? Nop,1
Great app for listening music 🎶.,5
One of the Splendid Musical Apps as I luv to read the lyrics along with the song.,5
I love ❤️ Spotify music and the GREATEST OF Jo ROGAN PODCASTER,5
The last month this app has progressively gotten worse. After the last attempt to uninstall/reinstall all of my playlists are empty and I get a message saying there isnt internet connection and to try again. So frustrating since I'm paying for the premium.,1
It doesn't allow me to log in it says im abroad and shouldn't change my location even after i do so it doesn't allow me in i will change jt when when it start working,1
"Controls to pause, skip track, etc have disappeared for days. Killing the app was a fix but that has stopped working.",3
"lately I've been having A LOT of problems with spotify. the songs just won't play normally, it pauses every 10 seconds without explanation. and it's been happening on the desktop version too. please fix it, it's really annoying.",2
My everyday music app. Has a large database of songs compared to Prime Music.,5
Ads and limited skips??? Come on Spotify. You are going to lose customers now. The reason I left Pandora was the ads and skip limits!! NOT HAPPY!!,1
"Love the app , although they shud let rhe ppl online have a lil more accessible option",5
I love how I can turn off the screen and still listen. My only complaint is how it will play the next newer podcast file rather than go down the list.. it would be nice if there was an option to autoplay in either direction on the list,5
Not work in my mobile properly just useless,1
Why so many ads in every 2 songs. They say one ads for 30 min whts going on this app Too many ads worst app,1
Why can't you choose your own songs? It'll make it simpler and give people more freedom.,1
"Loved Spotify premium when I had it, but as soon as I couldn't afford it I was booted to free Spotify, and I never realized how absolutely awful it is. Limited skips and the inability to pick a song or make a queue is maddening. As someone with ADHD, I need this ability because I often need specific songs for certain activities. But no, that is now impossible because I am poor. Thanks for making me feel worse about it, Spotify.",2
Spotify just gives a wonderful experience to music,5
I love the app. I do wish there was a way to remove songs from the recommended section at the bottom of the playlist that way you could get new recommendations without having to hit refresh a bunch of times.,4
It's alright best to get a subscription to enjoy all features. It's still good when free too.,5
I just love having access to all types of songs that speak to my current situations. Love being able to download and listen even when I'm away from home. My alarm is linked to Spotify and my mornings start with the best melodies,5
"This app is actually very useful for , like the songs that I don't have , they have it here and I can play one of my favourite songs even though I don't have the song. But the problem is that I don't always have data . For once can't there be a good app that doesn't have to use up data or WI-FI. Like really we don't ( I don't ) have the money to buy data every time I need to come on Spotify . Thank you .",3
I am not able to open Spotify it just freezes when I try to open it on the main screen I can't listen to songs 😭 HELP!!!,2
Would've been 5 star but the shuffle music isnt needed I'm trying to listen to specific song instead it plays a different song,1
Great app easy to listen and share music,5
I'm using first time this music app it's amazing music collection. Thanks for the making app,4
"I've been using this app for years and only recently decided to upgrade to premium. I was very excited with all the perks you get. The only downside to it however, is that for some reason I'm still getting adds whenever I listen to podcasts? Which I don't really understand? Because, you know, I'm PAYING for NO ads? I mean I can understand when you get adds from the person you're listening to cuz they're built into the audio. But I've heard the SAME adds in multiple podcasts. Kinda dumb right?😑",3
"I hate everything about this app, the most user-friendly app I have ever purchased. Day one and I can not cancel it fast enough.",1
Love it! Easy and everything I love,5
Exceptional application and exquisite terms of use.,5
"Great app, it's my go to for music.",5
"I'm glad I can listen to my favourite podcasts but this whole you have to pay all of a sudden to listen to a song you like, that is not worth it, i suggest you take a step down with the latest update",2
Just able to here some Playlist of certain artist and Era.,5
"Literally , Spotify is awesome 👌🏻 👏 .Just love it 😀 😍 ❤️",5
Good musical app obviously.But should be care about bengali songs.Not sufficient collection.,3
New experience. Still getting to grips with options,4
1 Star because in after every songs advertisement started.. this is very bad idea... Please change this... Then it will be Better One all other apps... Thank you..,1
"every time I want to open an mp3 file on my cellphone, it opens with the Spotify application. is there no option to stop it? please remove that ASAP.",1
"I love this app! Found musiç that I've been looking for for years - and compiled playlists according to my tastes. Easy to use, even for me.....somewhat elderly, to put it politely. I recommend this app.",5
"Google Home speaker volumes never stay at what I set them to when playing via Spotify. Set the volume from Spotify and it resets one speaker (but not the other) back down to ~25%, when I didn't ask it to do that, even if I was turning the volume UP it still resets it down. It's really annoying and it needs to be fixed.",1
"All good...try making some daily mix according to various moods intead of same playlists ....and adds making experience annoying at some moments..except for this, all else is fine !!!",4
On playstation ads freeze up the app and it has to be restarted once a week of not more. On my phone I have to force close the app or else it will stay open in the background.,2
"This is a great application, but you could have made settings to translate song lyrics to any language",4
"This app just stopped working.....uninstalled numerous times, reset the cell, cleared the cache and still not working...family premium member and I can't use it! Very frustrating!!!!!!",1
"Spotify have always been my go-to music streaming platform, but for awhile now does it consistently happen that the media control buttons doesn't appear in app or in notifications. I've tried to clear the app cache and tried to reinstall the app but nothing seems to work",3
i like using spotify because i find all my favorite songs in it and other things that may please everyone but the only problem is that it needs wifi and you can't skip just 5 times per hour ..but i still like it,4
This app was good before not now cus this is not performing well with my phone it crashes frequently and shows ' no internet connection ' even though it is connected. It's kinda disappointed with Spotify,2
Absolutely 💯 % fantastic for music of any genre looking forward to the moment I move to premium.,5
Group session is not working even when I'm on premium,1
This is the best app for songs I ever had 👍,4
"The best app ever, I got a collection of music from AC/DC to Zebra and over 50 playlist on file... Spotify Your The Best, forget the rest... 2021-2022 and still going strong... Shut-Up Randy",5
This is a great app to use for listening to music for free! The only problem is sometimes I'll get like 5 ads in a row. But otherwise 10/10 recommend!,5
"spotify on chromebook is awful, i genuinely dont understand why it is so bad. the app shuts down almost every hour, the music is laggy and you cannot see friends activity. i really hope they improve the app because it honestly ruins my music listening experience while i work on my chromebook",1
Very good music but premium is a bit pricey,4
I have downloaded the Spotify app on my Android phone and it gets stuck at the Spotify logo. I've restarted my phone a few times. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I've forced stop the app and restart it again. I'm connected to the internet. Nothing works. It remained stuck at the Spotify logo.,1
This app sucks. It is the worst. I have tried managing it but it just isn't worth it. Don't install the app especially if you have a Samsung. It doesn't allow you to fast forward the music. It also doesn't let you to go back to a previous song or go to the next song for free. I hate this god damn app😡😡🔥😡🔥😡🔥😡🔥😡😡. It f ing sucks 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡.,1
"You know, ive had this app for a couple years now. I even PAID FOR PREMIUM. IT DOES NO GOOD. ON -ROKU- THEY STILL HAVE NOT FIXED THEIR APP TO PLAY MORE THAN 10 MINUTES WITHOUT FREEZING!!! YOU HAVE ONLY 1 JOB, PEOPLE. LITTLE CHANNELS PRODUCED IN GRANDMAS BASEMENT CAN RUN SEEMLESSLY ON -ROKU- WHY CANT YOU?",2
My type of songs. Love them. Thank you🌺,5
Best music player ....... You can create your own playlist ans share with your friend's and realtives ....... Just one problem it contains add when you don't have premium subscription ..... I have premium subscription so i dont face problem,5
Just love all the great music choices!!!,5
Changed my previous back to 5 stars. The ability to preview songs before adding them to your playlist is back. Back to being my favorite music app :),5
I like it but I have one problem that is the extra songs I hate it when my favorite songs end one of the extra songs starts to play plz delete it,4
"Filled with ads, they basically make u desperate to buy premium, and even after they give an ad which gives us 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening, one song later, there is a new ad!!",3
It is a very good app. It has all the music you need. So you should all try it,5
"bring back the ability to play and shuffle at the same time or i'm canceling my premium. this is ridiculous, who asked for that to go away?",1
Found everything i wanted in this app I'm going premium very affordable,5
Don’t download this app this app is trying is best to make it hard to listen songs. Hate suffle 🤬 Just try mod apk its great or buy premium don’t be a fool😘,1
"Player doesn't remember the time i left off at while listening to podcasts, seems like every update breaks a major component of this app...",1
Spotify is better than other apps its doesn't stuck Which is pretty good but one thing you can bring is some more songs maybe cuz i didn't find much Chinese popular songs not only Chinese you may add some others too that is my suggestions,4
"The app sucks. I pay for dual membership and it constantly stops on its own for no reason, not connected to anything. The play bar disappears and the only way to pause it is to close the app entirely. It constantly rewinds itself 10 seconds when playing podcasts. And it's not just my phone it's my husband's too. Both are fairly new phones. It's ridiculous to pay for a service as much as we do and they can't even get the app to work properly. And I do have auto updates turned on.",1
2 stars due to lagging play a song allgood 2nd song comes on plays for about 20sec then cuts off everytime. Iv uninstalled and reinstalled to see if it fix the problem and nothing still the same and I'm a premium customer this use to be one of the best apps.. what's going on Spotify paid customer to get ripped off not cool. If not fixed uninstalling for good take my $$ somewhere else.,2
I'd rather use YouTube/ YouTube music. At least it gives you enough features while having the ads. Spotify doesn't even play some songs if you don't have a subscription,1
Can't think of a better music app but only thing is I've been having trouble with bugs for a few days now.. so requesting u to fix those bugs and the rest is fine Ps- I'll change my review once the bugs r fixed,3
"They blatantly lie about the free version, making me distrust them so much I won't uograde to premium. They claim that fewer than 15 tracks on a playlist in free mode means they'll add songs to the playlist. I have >20 & they keep adding tracks, including tracks I already hid. Plus, they are STILL one of the worst in paying artists, so I'll continue to pay Apple Music despite its glitches (pays almost double). App's also not intuitive, and I won't pay extra for something misleading and greedy.",2
"Best music streaming app I have used. **After a few years, I still agree. I used Pandora, and have access to it free w/ TMobile, have used IHeart and others. My experience w/ Spotify does not falter.",5
It is amazing and so much fun to listen the song back to back with spotify I loved this app,5
"New updates brought a ""Allow Bluetooth"" screen to popup everytime I open the app. Not sure why it keeps asking permissions for things it already has and might actively be using",2
Always interrupts ads,1
"Developer's, You collect to much of my personal info, then it states I can delete all of my personal info. I can't delete mine! I just turned phone on. Spotify was playing a show when I didn't turn Spotify on. I uninstalled the application. I want my personal information Deleted! Please fix this. I don't know what Android wear is, but that's the 1st question.",1
Apart from having to pay £10 because that all I can afford to get ad free music is PERFECT! Thx,5
"Fix Android Auto integration. Performance is poor and interface is terrible. Menus are very poorly thought-out, recently played is never up to date and playlists are difficult to search.",1
The last update of Spotify is totally sucks. I can't played all my favorites music anymore if im offline and all my downloaded playlist is totally gone. What happened Spotify fixed all the bug and changes and all the mess you done. And its restricted the plan even you pay premium. Please back the old update. I loved the application but this is very disappointed and frustrating. Im using Spotify from the start and paying premium every monthly.,1
It's really good app because in the traveling we can listen many playlist...,5
"Premium is Best , plain is full of Add",4
To many advertisement!!!,1
I've used it for years. Even without premium there aren't many ads so it's ok to listen without it.,5
Always have music on so use Spotify and stream it through house.,5
Love no ads!,5
"The app will NOT work. Just a black screen with spotify icon. Have cleared cache and data, logged out, reinstalled, restarted device. No purported solutions work!! So frustrating. Support is garbage as well. Chat support has you do the abovementioned over and over with same results...Einstein's definition. Premium is a cimolete ripoff if it won't work on mobile devices!!!!",1
"Free listeners get about a minute and a half of ads every two songs. It's crazy excessive. And you're forced to listen to you're playlist on shuffle. You can't pick what song you want to listen to, or listen to your playlist straight through. I know they want you to buy Spotify Premium, but ruining the free experience is not the way to do it",1
I like it but pls allow a ewallet pay section for premium pls i really need it,3
"If you want to be a free listener, then don't get it. You have limited skips and you can't pick the songs you want. I would recommend Pandora.",1
I dont know why the app is stuck right now. It does not open. Its for the first time since i am using. I have reinstalled it twice but nothing changed. It was ok before but idk what has happened. Plz guide me!!,3
User interface isn't customizable and Spotify doesn't care what their users want. Another company that doesn't respect their paid users.,1
"Its Great app, No complaint so far.",4
6/29 Update - STILL Constantly deletes downloaded songs. All the time it just deletes the entire library.,1
"I downloaded this app, started using it,it was fun but after few days, songs I liked ain't playing anymore.",3
I love how I can edit playlist and everything in the app. Can we be able to move the playlist thenselves in the order we like without having to go to PC please. Thank you.,3
Really great app with loads of feature in their premiums.,5
Really 5minutes of adds???🤬🤬🤬🤬 Sometimes even more than 5mins and just to get 30minutes add free? 😡😡😡😡,1
"Like the app but it's become buggy lately! It doesn't run in the background consistently when the phone is locked (even though it has the permission) also sometimes it takes too long for it to load the song, even on high speed internet. My phone is Google Pixel 3a. ******** Update in summer 2022: The problem is solved. Thanks!",4
It was great to have something that works it was great to have something that works oh I said that twice,5
World best music player 👍👍👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👌❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤lovely app for music,5
"Great algorithm, loving the app.",5
"Easy to use, sound is okay. They took away, for free users, the ability to pick a song from an album and add it to a Playlist. They wouldn't let you listen to it, which is fair, but atleast you could add it to a Playlist and enjoy later. Now all you can do is shuffle a artist and hope you get the song you want.",2
So easy to use and it is awsome app.,5
Awesome...has tons of song options and almost always has the songs I'm looking for!! Highly recommend this app to everyone.,5
If I could give zero I would worst music app ever,1
"Does have the library it boasts. Gotta restart it sometimes, but I look forward to them fixing this. Good deal.",4
I really enjoy as it is ad free.,5
Glitchiest POS app i have on my phone but great music selection.,1
Insanely great app for listening to musics of your choice,5
Great experience I like music collection and sound quality,5
Spotify is more difficult to work than other similar platform but one's you get the hang of it it's all good from there Scotty boy 💯 Spotify playlist check me out 🎧💯 plus if I make a playlist up I want to play it in the order that I set it up on its on shuffle and it's a pain when I'm trying to show my skills to the public what goes with what track after another in a selective way like it should be done by Scotty boy 💯 Spotify playlist 🎧,4
"its a good app yeah idk ads are not that annoying as usual but its mostly this one ,, when i try playing my playlist or sumthin idk it plays a different songs that isnt in suggestions or in the playlist. please fix that because idk most of the goofy AHHH songs and it is very annoying that we dont get to listen the songs in the playlist i created",4
Its good but the random thing makes me hate it at times,3
"Love it...no complaints. Love the customization, the ability to one particular song, and listening to an artist station that only plays THAT ARTIST and not similar ones too.",5
"Love it!!!!!!! Music old and new, podcasts, make and share playlists.",5
Love the variety and so easy to use!,5
The best music app I have ever used in my life Offers great sound quality 🔥,5
It glitches when my phone screen turns off and won't play😠,2
I love music . Nice experience,5
I love the app I would give it 4 stars but it keeps on playing suggested songs and I don't know how to take them of.,1
only down side is that u cant download music offline,4
Always a great selection of music. Never disappointed 😉 It's my go to daily,5
Only 4 stars because there will always be room for improvement.,4
Besides the free music. It has terrible navigation. I cant play a specific song from a playlist. Either that or the features are well hidden,3
"So far so good! Just getting it, so I haven't explored through it yet.",5
Good but wish it was better the fact that u can't pick the exact song u want to play but u have to wait and the ads are a problem if ur not paying for the premium.,3
I listen to it every day. Lots of options for us podcast junkies,5
"I hate the recent changes to the ""My Library"" section of the app. Bad design choice. Please revert back. -6/7/2021 That was my last review. Now I'm going back and reducing my rating even further because the quality of service from Spotify and their application has gotten worse. I pay for Spotify premium to have an ad free listening experience. Spotify is now inserting ads into podcasts that already have integrated sponsorships, even for premium users. 1 star.",1
Love Spotify. I especially like how Spotify exposes me to music that I would normally never hear on commercial radio. Totally recommend,5
This device is too slow and too demanding. There's s lot of features that complicate it's use. Spotify does not work at all.,2
Amazing! Almost every day at every hour I listen to music and Spotify gives me a lot of opportunities to keep listening my favorite jams and podcast.,5
Sound should be increased to best experience,4
Good library to choose from.,5
"Autoplay is frustrating. I hate when I connect to any of my Bluetooth devices, Spotify immediately starts playing. I'll pick what I want to play on my device, thank you.",3
I just love Spotify. I never go a day without it!,5
"Love it, simple to use, but effective!",5
"Such a wonderful app, but it contains adds after each song. This is the only demerit in this app. Other features are awesome.",5
I like the app so far. I should take the time to make more playlist.,5
High quality of sound,5
"This app annoyed me too much, come on!! Ads after every single music?? Why why why??? And I'm not a billionaire to get premium account...",1
All your music needs in one place,5
I can hear all my favourite songs,5
"I used to love this app. It had a very large selection of music and podcasts, but over the years I've used this, the ad amount has started to add up to a point of dislike. I stopped listening to the music, but then the ads started to come into the podcasts. For the last 3 years had this not happened. Please change it back.",4
If I say play my liked songs don't play songs that I didn't like I liked them for a reason so I can listen to it,1
"This app is great for streaming music, but it's gotten this habit of just closing randomly, even in the mode of a song. I thought this would go away after a month but no, plz fix this",3
Since the update it constantly crashes,1
"I disabled the automatic and timer player, but nothing works on this app ! Waking me up at 12 am !!!! With this music that I don't even like and I couldn't find a way to delete this music from play recently or from history!",1
"This app does not work, song quality is subpar. Find literally anything else.",1
Best music app period,5
"Terrible android performance lately. Loss of audio, playbar constantly disappearing. Constant Bluetooth issues. Please fix this.",1
I don't understand why I had to put it 1 star for 3 months. Changed to 4 stars,4
I really like this app you can listen to everything but there are a lot of add,4
Nice with excellent music/I like the sound of the music,5
Collection is good. But genre of any song can be added in the information and selection panel. So any user can play their favourite genre. It's just a suggestion.,4
Full of adds for every 5 mins.,1
"Every time I play the sound, for example the song ""tak ingin usai"", when I play the song instead of ""tak ingin usai"" it's another song instead.",1
"Fun, good music selection",5
"Can't really use cuz can't play songs that I like because it add songs for you, deing able to download 1-2 songs for free,light mode but like I'm gonna use it and make it easyer to find settings (mobile)",2
"Never take their offer. They wont stop charging you! Its because anyone on your network can click on premium and your paying. No way to stop this, have to delete Spotify and never use it again. Only option. You will have to cancel your bank card. They will ask for pictures of your bank account to prove it. Dont trust these criminals at all with your bank info.",1
Best music quality of all music apps.Even all new and old songs are present on Spotify. And provides you playlists of your own choice.,5
Spotify was great ... but now..it's not the same. I cannot get karaoke mode in my samsung tab and for many songs lyrics are not there,2
"Spotify is a great app, started using it this year and it has really met my expectations. The premium feature is good and saves one from those ads popping up. The real issue I have is that can you create a mode where one can resume his playlist after playing a particular music or album, coming to start your playlist afresh after listening to an album can be sad. I once resume my playlist during the free listen mode but I can't anymore using the premium feature.",4
Love it so much haven't experienced any problems so far. It's good to listen to podcasts while jogging or busy with work that doesn't need my full attention.,5
Great selection of music and podcasts,5
Too many ads and can't pick a song always dhaffles.,1
"Bad functionality , sometimes it's nt working proper.",1
"Love the music, love the layout, love eveything about it, only issues I've had were at times not being able to see the year recap, not that important but it's a great feature at the end of the year or decade and lots of people put effort into others and users seeing it, and some look forward to seeing their music efforts or changes or feelings, so it kinda sucks that it can but out for you If you are on a lower end phone or a phone with poor storage, mine has both issues, but otherwise, love it",5
"Great app overall but Group Session really needs to be fixed. For the past months, the song plays out loud on all connected devices, connected devices can't access other apps that make sounds without cutting the music and the queue often glitches, and replays the same songs.",3
Why the hell this crashes everytime,2
Nice app for listening songs,5
Very nice app I get all the songs without give money and with very less ad,5
I love that you can multiple playlist it's really wonderful to be able to play the music that you like and the different playlist and even ones with albums to play whenever you want them to or to play continuously it's there are no ads eit I've never loved music more I can pick all the ones that I want and put them in one John and I can pick all the other ones that I really like and put them in another one and then I have at least two that I can listen to but I have five right now and it's great,5
I've been using Spotify for a while now and i really like the expirence but lately the app is not opening at i tried everything but it's not opening i humbly request u to fix this problem as i really like this app and it's music quality.,2
"Probably the best music app ever made, its only downside is that it doesn't have that much unreleased music",5
The best music app n experience ever ..kudos to the creator...but make it a bit cheap to give access to all n sundry,5
Why I like this app it has no ads I hate ads like mad it get me mad any way I give big thanks to the developers I like that keep it up,5
No problem in using this app got better experience here a large collection of song or we can say that universal collection...,5
"Some UI hiccups quite often (freezes, UI inresponsive etc.). Also, keeps asking Bluetooh permission all the time, this is super annoying! If I say no (actually not an option, only ""Maybe later""), the app should not keep pushing for an access. I find it little shady that app wants to constantly spy the BT devices near me.",2
Poor optimization and network issue,1
"The best music streaming app ever, love the wrapped and all the other features that keep this app new and fresh all year round 💕",5
Love my Playlist that Spotify recommends. I have my family hooked as well.,5
"Stop adding random songs to my Playlist, it's annoying",1
Just downloaded it today and created an account. Tried playing any music but no avail. It doesn't play any music at all,1
There are a lot of ads but hey its free. Aside from the ads I absolutely love this app. I like all diff types of music and this app has many options. I can listen to whatever I feel like at the moment.,5
This is a good app. And enjoying the song . sounds Quality is good.,4
"I don't if it's just me or what, but I hate it when the share lyrics button removed on my spotify, I'd suggest to put that feature again.",5
"This is the best app for listening a music, background,sound quality is awesome, I make a playlist on this app nd it become best ever... 😇",5
6skips per hour +they will force you to listen in other song that you don't even want so you are most likely to skip it that's where the annoying part is gonna start... 6skips won't be enough to play the song you want like I mean literally.,1
Absolutely love Spotify.,5
"It has a lot of music but there are a lot of small issues. Deluxe versions of albums that I bought on iTunes however long ago aren't available and there's no way for me to add music that I already paid for. The shuffle algorithm is straight up horrible. Also, it'll randomly switch from my liked songs to a song's ""radio"", e.g. a discovery mode. And I don't want that and I'm not sure how or why it happens",3
Full of ads .. they offer 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening and then ad came after every song,1
App won't open my liked songs. Wasn't having this problem until about a month ago.,3
"Cannot pick or choose any song from the album list..only can pick the first song..after that,need to wait the album finish shuffled all song..please fix this problem..need a free acces to pick or choose the song we want to play",1
It was awesome can't stop listening to it such a great s*** all the time 247,5
"So many broken or faulty things in the app it is embarrassing. Like if I download podcast episodes, I want to be able play them when I do not have an internet connection. But you can't do that since you need a connection to view your download list.",1
"Good app but there is problem I face Every time.When I am using with network it does not work.Therefore I have to use von every time.It just annoying to connect vpn every time.so, that was thoughts about these annoying thing.",3
Can't play on s22 without it pausing when screen is locked. Changed permissions and reinstalled and hasn't changed,1
Good to listen even if you dont have premium,5
Very bad do not download why paying for something which is free forever!,1
"Most entertaining and exciting,with excellent switching from one zoner to another swiftly.so many apps for music r there ,but SPOTIFY IS par excellence.",5
This is the best music app. Stress buster. Best mind relief. I love this app,5
Great music at my fingertips. Love it,5
"Buggy mess on samsung fold. Whoever fault it is, the OS does not pick up spotifys audio stream as media, so once you start playing a song it cannot be stopped or interacted with without quitting the app. Audio continues to pay in background on other apps such as YouTube",1
Love Spotify new to it enjoying it,5
"Its a good app I like it, but it's so damn annoying bec of the ads. Like i just accidentally clicked some song then literally 3 ads appear & it's unskippable. I'm on mobile. On pc this app works great, so please just let the ads come after a while they keep on popping up.",4
"The app is good but that not the reason why I gave it three stars for the pass month of two my music keeps cutting half way or it will cut from the beginning of the song i can't even go on my other social media apps without Spotify acting up its extremely hard for me to listen to my music. Spotify if the only song / podcast place that I use when my hands are busy, the adverts are just the worse also 6 skip each hour isn't good at all.",3
"It's so good to listen to good music on a user friendly platform,but still room for improvement, Spotify is oviously the best out there. HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOWNLOAD",5
"Started off well, could listen to songs and skip songs if I wasn't wanting to listen to that one that day. Then suddenly cannot skip songs. By all means have adverts but allow songs to be skipped. Songs have emotional connections and some days you're not ready for certain songs. I think I will have to delete",1
App stopped working after update. I can only play saved music because the main page or search doesn't appear at all.,2
Superb app. Specially for searching songs,4
"Latest update I cannot pause, fast forward a song or close the app. Review just went from 5 stars to 1 star.",1
Right now I'm trying to play my fav song on this app yknow it just starts at the end it didn't even started at the start of the lyrics plus I can't play my fav songs in my playlist it just plays a different songs pls fix this F you Spotify bring back old Spotify!,1
Love it i wish i had premium tho i sadly cant purchase dtuff on my phone,5
"Though not bad enough. But the we want to play, it plays another one. That is annoying thing.",3
This app is good but it should be run offline as well,5
"It's a really good app , you can listen audios, songs, etc while being on another app at the same time. I had no problem signing in in this device, but then I signed in from another device. I inserted the name, password,email etc and all, but it kept loading forever. The app kept on loading the next day and on and on, it never let me in. It's an annoying glitch and it makes me really disappointed and mad. Fix this glitch soon as possible.",4
"great app but ads more...sometime not getting searching song, many troubles this software it hard to login this app and many many problem, would you stop this company go to eat butter chicken",3
I really loves this app is great I've give it a five stars,5
Good and easy to use,4
Great app! But I really do wish Spotify would include loseless audio for a much better music quality.,5
"I use to love this app. To me, it use to be one of the best music apps. But after last update, it has gone down hill. Now when I listen to a playlist it will just start playing random music and then start the playlist over again. I use to never have any problems. Now it is full of bugs. Until it gets fixed, I won't be using it anymore. Until it is fixed, I wouldn't recommend it to others either.",1
Why i cant update my app you have a new karaoke mode but my app is still not updated.,2
I am able to play music but some of the time the music is going to a different song instead of my actual list and I haven't even finished the playlist yet!!! Fix it.,3
"WHEN A PERSON SELECTS TO CHOSE AN ALBUM, ALL HE WANTS TO LISTEN TO, IS THAT SPECIFIC ALBUM. I HATE HOW RANDOM SONGS END UP INBETWEEN TRACKS OF ALBUMS. I ALSO HATE THE NOT BEING ABLE TO SKIP TRACKS. THE NOT BEING ABLE TO GO BACK AS WELL.",2
No prob with music.excellent,5
Please add the add to queue option from search Bar too,4
"App bugs, shows ""No internet available"" , even i have High speed connection available.",1
"You can stream songs in a lot of places this might be the worst, if you want to make a play list they add songs to YOUR play list and give you only 6 skips an hour so you don't get to listen to your own songs on YOUR play list you don't have enough skips to get to your songs and if you delete them of the play list they add more it is very anoing if you just want to play some music.",2
"I get this trash for free from work. Won't use it because of all the hate, and misinformation Joe spreads.",1
"I'm a premium user and I love the app. But for the past one week, It has been showing 'no internet connection' and my network is very good. Please fix this.",5
"Absolutely amazing app, can't complain.",5
I love Spotify music I can find all of my music that I love music that I grew up with with my sisters and brothers and my mother and father,5
"garbage app, i literally can't subscribe to premium, every time i try to click the ""send pin"" it just says ""oops, something went wrong, please try again or contact our support team"", i tried to subscribe on my laptop, used incognito mode, restarted my phone, used a different browser but nothing worked. I'll just stick with YouTube music.",1
I'm on the road all the time this app is great for the random Playlist,5

Too many ads,1
Not working properly,3
I think this is the good app..i really like this app...,5
"Been very glitchy recently,. It's really annoying. I just wanna listen to girl kn red and mitski. Is it just mine or?",3
Great app lots of music and can read lyrics too!,5
Best app for music and the free premium for a month is good to,5
It got some good music on here and easy to work with.,5
"Listening to podcasts, however I sort by.. it will play the previous episode next.. instead of the next episode, any advice?",4
Amazing sound and loved the app,5
Difficult to keep accounts straight when running a duo but great functionality,4
"Pretty nice to be able to listen to music in the background, though some of the ads feel like someone is puncturing my ears with nails and I wish you could turn off that specific ad",3
It's good but when I playy fav song it play other song that I don't like and it makes me mad because I tried it hundred times but still it play other song,1
Best app for listening music ...,4
It's good because it is nationwide music app for listening but I hate that I can't become a premium membership because I am in highschool and I don't have money or ATM to pay in Spotify so that is the problem and of course the ads because I am not in premium and when you want to change the music it can't cause it has a limited time only at 30min or you can't change cause only 3 song's only so that's my feedback.HAVE. A GOOD 😊 DAY,3
"Overall it's an amazing music app. However, i have recently been unable to see some of the buttons and icons when operating the app. It definitely looks weird and incomplete. It would also be nice if non-premium users would get a chance to join in on the group sessions. I'd have given a 5⭐ but I'll do a 2⭐ until the issue is resolved.",2
Your App is addictive. It has a unique way of compiling music of same genre by different artist in one place. Great indeed.,3
To many adds . After a song you get a add this goes on and on.,1
Very good music excellent to listen to . A fantastic variety of music to choose from,5
"The app wont load. Uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted phone, freezes at logo screen. I pay for this and cant access ANY of my music. That unsubscribe button is looking very tempting..",1
I rate it to stars because it's just it's just so boring it won't let me play on music something was very bad about this can anyone fix this please fix the Spotify,2
Cant cancel my premium account. There is no option and i have been charged,1
"In love with the new update, the song recommendations and the cross fade when the track changes, just amazing.",5
"I've been trying for so long to find my password by just can't find it on my account, and I can't get my account back in from my Xbox after accidentally gaining out that I was got you 5 so writing and that's the problem. Can you please help me with that?",4
"I love the downloads, although sometimes I would like for them to download a little faster, and if they had that singalong lyrics 2 that would be great",4
It's great now I can use this app at my country cause previously you couldn't connect to it,5
I'm Very disappointed in this app it keeps playing the other songs that I didn't add in my playlist I skipped many songs but the random songs keep playing in my playlist.,1
"I personally love Spotify, it has got amazing songs and podcasts too but my complaint has got to be about the length of the adverts and just the adverts in general, I can agree with giving 2 ads every now and then but when it's the same repetitive long ad coming on 3 times that's when I get annoyed and it is fair enough to put ads in if not paying for premium but I just feel they are too long. Other then that I love this app!",4
Would definitely recommend Spotify to a friend.,5
10/10 its just a tad bit difficult skipping songs on iphone.,4
Love this music app!,5
Best online music platform ever.,5
"App is a mess, playback wont continue anymore. Sick to death of this ""premium"" service that constantly cuts in and out. Sick of posting help post in community. Going back to pirating.",1
"False advertisement Well ihave been using jio savan but iam sick of adds in the middle of songs uninstalled the app. Then coincidentally i saw soo many adds related to spotify telling its add free, for this reason iam sold. After installing 1st day is normal no adds, started in the nxt day. So many adds foe every single sond there is add, if you really showing adds then dont advertise as add free.",1
The best music app indeed.,5
Why don't your l have the premium mini And why did you're make this app can't listen to a music with out paying,1
The sound turns off even though it shows the song is being played.,2
"hires audio online app, enjoy every music clear crisp",5
I really like it but I wish we could select the songs of our choice and skip the 1 we don like without premium,3
It provides everything I need to listen to music from the past and present.,5
"Amazing app, if you fix that it doesn't add more than one songs to queue and randomly skips queues when opened and played straight from the bar below...And please bring lossless music asap.",4
We can hear songs in between adds Prepared for adds play list Every song adds,1
Such a good app I mean what's wrong about it you have a repeat playlist so you can listen to your favorite songs but one thing add more skips plz Spotify well by adding more skips still a five stars 🤩,5
I had to switch accounts due to a mistake. Now after I logged out the app won't even load! I've done everything possible 5 times over & nothing will get the app to load.,1
The new update is incredibly nice and sound quality is good! Spotify Premium is truly worth it. I absolutely recommend Spotify more than other music streaming services. Thank you Spotify! 😊,5
Doesn't have streaming issues n it quite entertaining and you gotta get it if u don't already have it,5
i dunno why the lyrics cant appear even it's premium.. help me,4
bro I be spending hours listening to music on this app i love it. it works fine most of the time (the ads are annoying but I understand that there need to be ads for the app to be free) but I really like making playlists and stuff.,5
I want shuffle button for free user or make this app non free user anymore,1
I love being able to feel emotions by music. Spotify is amazing.,5
"Its a great app but I genuinely hate the fact they took away to preview songs, And the ads have been getting massively out of hand. I get like 5-6 in between 2 songs.",3
"I really enjoy Spotify. It's only real drawback are the ads. I understand the necessity, but some (many) podcasts play the same ad up to three times IN A ROW. Extremely annoying.",5
"It's yo good, I can't say anything to increase it",5
"The best music app, i was a Gaana plus user and recently switched to Spotify. I am very much happy, Spotify app is very much polished and bug free than Gaana and Music recommendations are also spot on.",5
First time using it. Love it's variety and rich sound!,5
Easy to use and love all the options for listening pleasure,5
The quality is excellent but the subtitles is not updated and some were not accurate.,3
So very nice is spotofy app,5
"Props 2 the writer of the short but informative Intel. When u dig into the bands page& read their history. As a metal head during its prime I think ur pretty spot on most of the stories about how the bands portrayed the music in that time and how the fans seen them. The app is great BTW. Been a paid customer 4 about 6 plus yrs. Not sure how long I can hang on being a paid customer, as we all know r country is going 2 hell in a hand basket, only essentials around the corner. Pray 4 us as humans",5
They hold your downloaded songs hostage unless you pay or uninstall the app. They don't even have permission to my files but they found a way into them I guess.,1
"On any other phone this would be a 5 star review, I'd just like to bring attention to the fact that the app is barely usable on the Galaxy Note 9. It acts like it doesn't have internet access when it does (regardless of the WiFi or 4G network I'm connected to) and it takes about 5-10 minutes to realize it actually has internet access, then takes another minute or so to load my library.",1
"While online, stops playing after 10 seconds of 1 in 5 songs. While offline, completely refuses to play 1 in 5 downloaded songs. Constantly forgets which songs I liked. Offline mode sucks. Tapping the 3 dot menu on a song spends 3 seconds trying to load even though there is clearly nothing to load. I can't browse music by artist and album, only filtering the list of all downloaded songs which doesn't even work. Typing an artist's name often onlow shows 20% of their songs I downloaded.",1
"It's very good and has 100% helped me during meltdowns to calm down. Other than small issues, it's decent. I can't change the playback volume anymore. 3 stars",3
"I stopped paying for Spotify because I disliked how many songs were repeated in many play lists 🙄 sometimes they put a song in a playlist if it can be remotely attributed to a genre 😏 wouldn't allow me to revert to free version when they no longer got my money. Or how about I had to pay them and my phone bill at the Same time, so if I'm away from wifi, I have to pay twice to listen to a song...no thanks! All about money",2
Love the music and my Playlist.,5
Fun and fast both nastalgic and Inlightning with recommendations.,5
"I loved the songs,hoping soon the lyrics were available ,im using premium account.",5
Constantly pauses playback...trash. its 2022 streaming is nothing new there is zero reason for any bs,1
The best and easiest music option,5
"Spotify is absolutely awesome,",5
Current version very glitchy for music playback. 10+ hiccups(micro pauses per song).,1
You put songs in my playlist that I don't want in my playlist cuz I just want to listen to my music on repeat and won't let me play songs i search for,2
best songs app :),5
You can do a lot of stuff but ads pop up a lot,4
I get to listen to good music and do something also.,5
"The app freezes and I have to reset it ALL THE TIME. Please, fix this 'cause I love the music quality and the all the app's functions.",5
Worst app ever. Service provider music player horrible. Dont bother subscribing some how it's worse when you pay monthly does not matter the device. I rather have my phone open and listen to YouTube for free then pay 15$ for this broken garbage,1
The songs are spirit filled songs they are beautiful,5
"Great app just missing a few songs., if you can take advantage of 90 free trail. It's worth it for downloading music.",5
Jkartel is the best artist on Spotify but he's very underrated,5
No words can express how I love this 😍❤❤❤,5
Please add option to listen from the beginning when playing podcasts episodes.,2
Cool. Played for background while bridge ladies were here. They wanted to know about it. So I showed them that I had it on my phone. They loved it.,5
"I've used Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music, and YouTube Music, and this one is my new favorite music streaming app. I have premium currently. The song radios are seamless and it's easy for the most part to navigate the app. Some things are much more convenient on the PC version, like moving lists of songs from one playlist to another. I'm glad it warns you if you are about to add a song to a playlist that already has the same song, it lessens the likelihood of repeats.",5
Mind-blowing very lovable app for me 👌😍🥰♥️🔥better sound quality and minimum ads which is good ☺️,5
"I had problems soon after installing the app. It seems impossible to shut it off completely. I was trying to travel using the Waze app for navigation. Spotify kept playing music unexpectedly interfering with my trip. The only quick solution was uninstall it, so I could safely travel using Waze as intended.",1
Spotify is best,5
I love spotify I use it every day,5
Cannot use the app. When i want to listen to a song it plays an entirely different song that has no connetion to the one i want. If i want to listen to another song on my playlist it wont allow me and it'll keep playing the song i dont want to listen to.,1
Awesome app. Never going back to other apps,5
"I have internet connection but spotify wont go online, so i can only play downloaded music. This has happened A LOT of times. I've tried to uninstall it, and reinstall but its not working, i used to work. I'm so mad at this pls fix it! fixed!!",4
Pretty reliable bad cell service or not,5
"Used to always crash before. But it's okay now, loving it! Music keeps me sane. Ive heard abt the karaoke feature. Cant wait!!!!!",4
"Sick of spotify blaming their awful service on customers with ""high expectations."" OH, you are sorry the service didn't work as I EXPECTED IT TO????? I guess it was too much to assume that your garbage app would do anything it said it would, just like you corporate clowns. My bad. Keeps getting worse and worse. Right on the cusp of canceling. I'd rather have no music than deal with this headache.",1
"I'm going to be discontinuing this service. They play the same songs over and over again on the artist channels. But more than anything, it's their support for that right-wing podcast person and paying him millions of dollars to spew out hatred and the Trump type of ugliness. I definitely prefer calm radio and it's a much better deal",1
"Bloatware garbage, unsolicited & pushed onto people with Samsung phones just like the Facebook & Netflix apps. Any app/business that forces itself onto customers of other products obviously isn't customer focused, rather it behaves like a scammer. Will never use Spotify again.",1
Sound comes in and out every 4 seconds or so. I don't have this issue with any other app. I love Spotify but not if I can only listen to music in 4 second intervals.,2
"I highly recommend using this, no subscription needed to enjoy!",5
"Great app overall but I don't like how it's different on iPads and phones, I would like to choose a specific song and not listen to only a preview.",3
Best music app there is. Legit not one song I haven't been disappointed knd.,5
Login doesn't work on app,1
Always awesome play lists!,5
spotify is by far the best way to listen to the music you love to stream and its free and premium allows you to keep your downloads and listen to them offline with premium amazing,5
I like the app the problem is when your looking for this song its sometimes gives you the different one and also the ad's i say pls take out the ad's,3
"My goto music app, HQ bitrate needed.",5
Good just wish it labeled better so it was more user friendly,5
I think its a good app i just wish i could chose the song i play,3
"Best sound, best quality of songs.",5
The app provides access to various smaller artists and provides them a platform to be heard,5
Nice audio quality and great collection,5
"I like the app so much , but the fact that I cant choose the song I want from my playlist is so painfull , and you can even imagine how painfull it is ... and now I am thinking to transform to another platform to play my music .",2
Great anytime music app.,5
Music has always been like a getaway for me and this really has helped me through hard times!!,5
Spotify is hands down the best music app I've used. It has every song you could imagine and lots of fanmade playlists to enjoy. It also has a fair parental ristriction that still gives a good 70 percent of the music. Defo recommend,5
My choice of app for music and commentary,5
There should be just a few more free options,4
Thise are a very usefull app and it get u all the songs ure looking for from old-school to new generation stuff,5
"I use my account every day, but today the mobile app just stopped working. I updated it and nothing. I uninstalled and then reinstalled it, twice, and nothing. It just sits there with a black screen and won't load.",1
"My favorite way to hear music, podcast and mediate!",5
"I love this app But when i dont update it it says nothing playing. But now i had update it and it says nothing playing, when i click a music it still says no music playing.",4
App keeps not showing the song or podcast (time line with the skip back and forth icons),1
"I don't understand what everyone is saying. I'm a free user and I can still play any song i want, I don't get ads and I don't have limited skips. So I don't see what the problem is. Love this app ❤",5
It's easy to use. An I have found every artist I pur in,4
Great app only problem is it is to big for me to keep on my phone Would be good if it was possible to move app to SD card,2
"Switched from Amazon Music to Spotify, so far I only see improvements, no unnecessary extra subscriptions to listen to my favourite songs. I'll definitely be sticking with Spotify for the foreseeable future. 😁",5
I like it it plays what I want to hear the music I like to hear you know it plays continually even if I cut the phone off so I do like this app a lot Recommend it for everyone,5
It has like all the songs. 🎵 It is also super easy to find the song you won't to listen to. There is the perfect amount of ads as well. You can listen to songs anywhere you like.,5
"All the music I could ever want, and more! It's my understanding that Spotify doesnt censor out dissenting views in podcasts, That is why I signed up. So refreshing to see an organization with integrity!",5
Sooo glitchy. Doesn't reliably play podcasts. Skips songs on its own. Not very good,3
Love my Spotify !! ❤ Thank you !!👍🙂,5
Best music I just need premium.,5
Alot of ads but dose the job,5
I can listen to all my fav songs And podcasts,5
This update is so disappointing when I make my own playlist it's suck because of the shuffle and it's start to play some song that I don't even add on my playlist,1
Lots of ads but other than that it's a great app to use especially if you're not great at making playlist cuz I have lots of those ready to go,4
If I had chance I wouldn't give one star because too many ads are so disappointing that's why please if you don't want to hear ads repeatedly then don't download this app. The main problem is that after 1 to 2 songs again and again bloody boring ads. The Worst app I have ever downloaded 😑 😒,1
Easy to use. Great selection.,5
"I'm giving 4 stars for the music selection. The ads are acceptable but having ads that are as long as a song is not fun. If I choose an album, I'd like to listen to that album and not have other songs inserted. I feel like Spotify has a special team to figure out what would annoy listeners the most so they'll pay for premium which annoys me even more so that's not happening.",4
"Really good app, new to it , with no prob.",5
God this app is so annoying like there 10 ads after every 3 songs like wth🙄🙄,3
Android app seems to get stuck in a loop when playing a large playlist - about 1000 songs. Seems to repeat 20 - 40 songs over and over. Deleting and reinstalling the app fixes is but only temporarily.,4
Awesome Always playing this over any station on my Alexa,5
I use this app all the time. Got it on practically all my devices. But for some reason it stoped worked. Doesn't load anything. Says all playlist don't have anything in them anymore. And it keeps saying it's offline even though I got internet. Ive tried deleting and redownloading multiple times and it still won't work.,3
"This app is seriously so buggy. I used to love Spotify but it skips like CD. Well turn off when the screen goes dark (the only reason any of us pay for you tube is to avoid this). Also, I've had the play bar disappear on me and I couldn't pause and play the song. I had to exit the app to turn off audio. I'm getting so sick of it and I've told my husband it's not worth an endless library of songs and podcasts if I can't enjoy listening to them. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled the app, nothing.",1
"Absolutely awesome app! I've been listening to my liked songs for so long. Spotify doesn't even have a lot of adds. I honestly give the app five stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Edit: this app is great, but I can't play a specific song without having to use my skips, (which are 6 for free listeners) so I took 1 star off. Please fix this",4
"Spotify gets to know you and will make you cry when you need to cry, laugh when it's time to let go, and smile when you remember everything you've been through and how strong you are now because of it.",5
"I Can't get enough of this amazing app, just one request. Kindly upload more African music, those old ones from 1999 to 2014",4
It's nice but on phone it mixes everything,4
"I'm trying to subscribe for samsung premium and it just keeps loading, it's not even taking me to the payment interface or stage",1
I don't play much music on my phone and I'm excited to use this app! Superb!,5
They made a update I think and I can't even get to here my fav songs this is dumb,1
"Great sound, wide variety",5
App is trash.. If you can use podcast addict do it. They are awesome. This app crashes glitches stops and starts randomly and denies control at times. If it wasn't for Rogan I'd never have downloaded it.,1
Wow great app for music,5
Me and my fiance that's overseas can listen from the same Playlist... it's another way we connect with each other when he's gone...,5
"there was a drop down thing that I think has recently got removed when you search for a song on the app. it was useful to add a song in a playlist, etc., directly without having to first play the song and sometimes sit there for an ad to get over. it also makes the whole process tedious having to do it with multiple songs. I don't know if this review will be taken into consideration, but it'll be appreciated if it gets reverted back to its earlier state.",4
I enjoy the choices of artist and songs I can choose,5
Best Music app have come across! Getting all my favourite music and all i want! Mahn this the best no need of more already this is enough.. is good to go with. Clear sounds too. This 10/10,5
Constant shutdowns and issues despite updated software and new android.,1
Started off great. Seems like lately Spotify had been laggy and unresponsive at times. Stops playing music for no reasons. And it's annoying that it ask every time I log in to enable Bluetooth. Debating if I should keep paying for premium 🤔,3
"I love Spotify, and all of the great features. If anything I wish I could add all of my liked songs from one artist to a playlist.",5
It's a good app to listen to your favorite songs some people complain about the 6 skips an hour but its great it gives you a chance to find new music / new things you might be interested it or like👍. Overall great app,5
I like 50s and 60s 🎶 holds lots of memories for me and hubby John that I care for 24/7 we have sing song just the two of us🤗🤗🤗💞,5
Love the app just can't get premium cuz I'm not always goin to the store,5
Ads are getting excessive!,2
"First time signing up with Spotify, still learning how to use the application.",5
"I love how I am able to link with Shazam for easier playlist additions and am able to retrieve playlists from years gone by , when they were erased by spiteful ex. Thx Spotify",5
Theres this glitch were the play bar gets removed so i have to keep uninstalling and installing this god dam app,3
"By far the worst music app. Plays the same 10 songs every time you shuffle, ads are beyond annoying, and you can't even view album anymore without paying. Back to pirating",1
I love Spotify!!! I love that I can listen to music offline. 💕💕💕,5
to the person who said you can't organize your music by genre: yes you can,5
Watch app is not working properly I hit the play button and it sends me to bluetooth but if I skip the song it will play and is able to play on watch with quick control buttons,3
Spotify is amazing 😍,4
The best app ever....runs smooth ❤,5
"You can't choose specific songs without paying... So this is basically just the radio... Still with ads... There's no reason to use this service ever, can't believe anyone would give them money, I'm afraid to see what their 'premium' service actually offers",1
Spodify is cool. The only issue is. You cannot play your favorite song on repeat unless you pay. So they'll play music that you're not even interested in which is the biggest con.,1
Why does this crash constantly?,2
"when i add songs to queue, only the last added song shows up and then it plays backwards, so, from the last added song",2
So dumb that you guys were out for a while and silly haven't fixed this app like I pick a song and it puts on another song that just didn't even pick I recommend people to use another app instead of this one,1
"Even after a new update, spotify never works properly. Now the issue is its not playing podcast videos. Really tired of paying for an app that never works. Cleared my cash, force stopped the app, checked settings allow all data and not save pods as audio only",1
"After free trial ends it's just a overall trash app😔 but you can fix that by paying premium 👍 after that it's the best music app I promise, but if you don't want to pay for premium I suggest SoundCloud",1
Not bad great app. Continue promoting the music,1
It really works. The quality is excellent and the music choices available are abundant. Great App. *****,5
This app is awful.. I used to love it but it has recently stopped working. I can't do anything on it and there is not way to fix it.,1
"A good way to hear music we like on the go, at home, at the office",5
"Easily my favorite music app, Spotify is the best in my opinion. The simple user interface, super deep catalog of music/podcasts and it's well worth the subscription to not hear the commercials 👍",5
"After getting the 1 month subscription Spotify app on my windows 11 is not working! It shows ""Spotify can't play this right now. if u have the file in your computer you can import it"". I have even tried reinstalling the app but it still acts the same. + All Songs aren't downloading in my mobile!",1
"Favorite music streaming app. Been using it for years along with Premium and have had little to few problems. Imo, worth the $10 a month. By being a beta tester (which I am as well), you can test new things they're thinking about adding to the app for a short period of time and its quite interesting!",5
I hate this app. You are too selfish to even listen to the fact that this app is not continuing to play music like it's supposed to when you update this music listening app. It loves stopping in the middle of a song and not keep playing like it's meant to do. This is pitiful for everyone and not enjoyable. I looked for a solution to this problem. But all have failed.,1
I used my boyfriends card one time to make a payment and they went and took two payments off with out permission. I did not save the card to the account,1
Love it. No adds just music.,5
one song one ad of 30 second.... really very dissapointed with spotify... rudiculous way to beg for the money...,1
"When you play a song, you should see at the bottem which song you are playing and how far you are in the song. But I can't see that anymore please fix this🙏🏻",5
Incredible 😃 is this for music I love 😘 it all time in this app,5
I love listening to music when I work read and draw. I love Spotify and the podcast,5
I'm really really irritated that you only get six skips in your liked list. What if I'm not in the mood to listen to a song that I like? At LEAST give us unlimited skips in our own Playlists. Please. I know I'm not the only one frustrated.,2
So far it's okay we'll just grab more later when it starts playing a list of songs that I really like,4
"Like a meth head selling his daughter on the corner do this- 3 month free trail, after 2.5mths make a new email and account then share playlists rinse and repeat (I am poor can't afford a cup of noodles)",5
Overall the app is great when it works but the daily crashes are an issue,3
Great and easy app,5
Been using Spotify for a decade or so and get nostalgic with some of the songs I've started from back in the day. Thanks Spotify,5
Dont know if its the song or the app but all im getting are bits and blurbs of songs,2
Horrible. Why can't I play a Playlist in order without premium. What's the use of calling it a Playlist if its always on shuffle?,1
Music quality is fine ; decent but for the non premium member its going disappointing day by day .. in my first experience ads appears then after 6 songs now this is after the every 2 songs ... this is not done ... thinking for Uninstall this app ....untill the margin increases to 6 songs 😔 😟 🙁,2
"The experience is very good and I recommend choosing this streaming service, other fancier streaming services are more expensive but not all phones can handle that quality so that's why Spotify is a good choice for most of the devices out there because only higher end phones are capable of super high resolution anyways",5
Good app. I can find most of the music I enjoy listening to. However if you do not get the premium you have to listen to a lot of play lists in order to hear the music you like.,2
Rated it one star cause before we could listen to all songs in the desktop app we can listen to songs normally but in phone after the update we only can preview songs even the ones that were there in my playlist please fix this,1
"Used to love Spotify, after the last 6months or so it's just been a glitchy mess and every update does nothing to change it getting to the point I want to cancel and find a better service",2
Worst experience ever I've buyed 1 month subscription and just after that my Spotify is not responding anymore🥲,3
I can find what I'm looking for easily.,5
Superb sound quality Spotify discribed in 3 word SSQ,5
"I have premium but even then, sme songs can't be played whole offline. For example, the song Cold Cold Cold by Cage the Elephant is gray and when you click on it it says it's unavailable. It's one of my favorite songs and I can't listen to it offline.",3
Using for 2 years lately the app is crashing nonstop,5
Best music app out there. Premium is worth the purchase.,5
The app is very very nice. I love this app so so much....,5
"Why can't you find a full list of songs by an artist? They're obviously there as you can search for a specific track and bam it's there, but if you do a general search for an artist only 5 tracks show up",2
Its out of rhis world. No words ro desscribe. Its an Awesome expeeience,5
Whenever Im hearing a playlist its always shuffled but the problem is there is no shuffle button. And I couldn't see the songs that were included in the playlist. PLEASE FIX THIS. Its stressing me out.. Edit: I'm sorry I keep whining but please fix this.. Please please please please please please please,2
It's a very good music app but it would be nice if the lyrics came in Tamil,4
Love the premium features,5
This app is not working properly,1
I give four star because we have to give money for listening to songs add free,4
Very good and I think everyone can use it,3
Seems like lately every time I boot up Spotify it gets stuck on the loading screen or it'll display the song but it just won't play. It's as though it's paused and it'll say that I'm disconnected from the internet despite having signal or Wi-Fi and all my other apps work. Also sometimes when I boot up and it the queue will disappear along with the player that shows the song I was listening to last.,2
App never works always crashing and lagging I Uninstalled to reinstall and now it won't load,1
"This is a great app for creating and sharing playlists, discovering new music/artists/podcasts, and releasing your own work. It is definitely worth buying premium.",5
"I really enjoy the scope of music thats available if you can think of if they have it. Ths one thing that rubbed me wrong was, when I set this up I wanted the family plan? I was unable to set up my wife with Spotify and I hear about it from time to time. I should'nt have to tell you about it here but I couldn't get anyone to help with the setup.",5
Wynk is more user friendly... After each song ads comes,3
I always have service even working in a warehouse if I go out of town. I listen to music like people watch TV. Music is therapy and it's a constant thing in my house. I love the no ads/ commercials either,5
Too much Ads are there 👎🏻,1
Great but less advertised,4
I really enjoy my music. Spotify is the best App.,5
"It's been great, only issue I may have is, with my one very big Playlist, it still repeats some songs, as though there is only like 20 songs instead of 100, but besides that I enjoy it",5
Used to love this app to recently. Now I can't play Playlist or artist I look up. Acting up lately,2
Earlier app was very good and 2 ads come at a tym now 4-5 ads come at a tym and is very difficult to listen on it and network problem is also there,1
The kareoke option is not working for me.I updated the app but still it doesn't work.It worked only once so I thought of doing it again but I don't have that option now,4
Best music app I have seen,5
"Except ads being how bad spotify ads are, this is a good app",4
This app is more concentrating on ADs rather playing a music...even if you here saying listen music without 30 min interruption still after 5 min you will listen a shirt AD... Why should I purchase your app..only to stop ads..common...only stupid people will buy your app to stop ads...rather I will download songs and hear them,1
"Great app for music and podcasts. But I want to be able to turn off recommendations (or new releases) or at least close them once I've seen them. I recently got a popup for a podcast with Reba something. I'm not interested. I'm a paying member, I don't want to have to close popups. I want to be able to choose whether to apply the playback speed to one podcast or all. One podcast, I want to listen at 2x another at 1x. I don't want to have to change it every time. Podcast Republic offers this.",1
"I dont know what the matter is, but this app, it doesn't want to download at all...trust me my storage space is enough for apps twice the size of mb of spotify idk why it doesnt want to download but I've been trying to download it for the past 5days!!!",1
Too much annoying ads...,1
"i cant play a song without getting to another song firstly . Like i search for a song to play but then when i tap play ▶️ it comes out another song that i dont know so then i need to skip 2 or 3 songs for it . Pls fix it , i can't hear a song while sleeping :( Overall its okay",3
"Recent updates have made the app awful. Always cuts out on Bluetooth, app freezes often and the downloaded songs aren't accessible",2
I like that I can just pick whatever song or album I want.,5
It's just amazing. Better than apple music.,5
"This is an amazing app for music like it's on the top for me but the only problem is with advertisements,like when an ad comes before a song and it says that now you can enjoy the next 30 minutes ads but after one or 2 songs which are not clearly of 30 minutes there is a another ad like it is a straight up scam and this happens all along a huge playlist and to me it is annoying so I hope this can be fixed....... Otherwise I would give 5 ⭐ rating. Thanks",3
Best app for listening songs 😃😃,4
A ton of content for a reasonable price,4
Can't sort podcasts by language,1
"Its a good music app, just the fact that they have an ad that says "" 30 minutes with no ads "" which is fake. They wont give u 30 mins without ads. Also they're adding songs to ur playlist, so u will have to waste your skips.",5
Why is the app version restricting than the desktop version? 6 skips per hour and it doesnt even play songs in the playlist that I created it plays songs randomly,1
"I just hope you could improve it a bit by including ""related search song""; where you search for a song and it's relation continue to play. Hope you get that?",3
"Supposedly downloaded songs keep disappearing even after I've uninstalled then reinstalled the app, it's very frustrating!",3
Why can't you guys set it up so i can move it to my sd card. It hogs up too much space on my phone.,1
It's just an awesome app.it has everything i would want in an app. Keep up the good work!!,5
I can find specific versions of songs that I can't on any other music streaming service,4
I have no issues in finding a song. I really like and injoy spotify,5
Even if YOUR 8 YOU CANT LISTEN TO MUSIC YA KNOW WHAT THAT NOT FAIR LET THEN LISTEN TO MUSIC PLUS IT HAS LESS SONGS,1
App good ads too bad one or 3 songs after 3 advertised hate this but love app songs,4
would be great if there's an option for me to change the sequence of songs in the playlist from my phone itself,3
Awesome app that's why I am giving 5 stars without ads and clear music and number of playlists than you Spotify ...,5
"I few songs I couldn't get on there because they were remixes, but otherwise it's great! Not a single ad with premium either😌 it also continues to play the songs when my screen goes off and my notifications don't interrupt!👏",4
"Spotify use to be a 5 star app, adding lyrics was a great addition, and they have a lot of social media influence. However all the other major streaming apps have some type of high-res streaming subscription offer. Why is Spotify so far behind in this!? Artists spend lots of time creating intricate details in music through Dolby Atmos, and Spotify doesn't even give us a chance to stream it that way. Saying they're working on it while other companies have already rolled it out. Let's catch up",1
"It's amazing but as a beginning artist is not too fair, still couldn't live without it. Luvz on Spotify",4
"Spotify is an outstanding music platform, with different genres for all types of music orientated people. Signed G",5
Superb App it is very amazing sound quality also superb and no network issue it work in village area also I give 5 star,5
I am getting ad based on my location but I want ad only in Hindi or English is there not any solution for it?,3
Love this app! Best music app around!,5
"Great! Only thing I'd change is allow for additional audio equalization in-app in addition to my android device's settings, to boost certain frequencies a tad more. Overall, though, great experience.",4
"Great app., good Music.",5
"AUGH THAT WAS CRAZY, I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED THAT SORT OF ATMOSPHERE IN AN APP BEFORE, ITS ABSOLUTE ELECTRIC, THE PASSION, EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD.",5
"Excellent sound, great assortment of music, easy to install and program.",5
"Great app, makes life happier.",5
Good quality and consistent play format..my go to app,5
"If I click to play music on PC, it shouldn't start playing podcast on my phone's speakers! Basic stuff, hire product manager.",3
I love it until some@$$ hacked my account and list all my playlist. Ughhh,4
"Song recommendations were good at first, now they are just repeating over and over again. Just found out that I have followers (W.T.F.?), and I DON'T WANT followers, but I can't remove them, unless I block them. Really really sad about this, I hesitated for a long time in paying for a music app and I'm very disappointed with spotify. 2/5 stars",2
"Awesome. Keep on rolling with the songs,thank you",5
"Lately the free version is unusable, two adds after every two songs. I am not going too buy that stuff anyway, and yes, they are the same two adds every time.",1
One more large downside I've noticed. Can we somehow gain the ability to expand upon only the top 5 songs by a single artist & make it so we can organize a single artists entire list of songs ever by popularity?,3
Works well. 30 minutes free of no ads by listening to only 2. All my favorite songs are on here!,5
"Doesn't work without data. Pretty much useless if you are not willing to use data while out and about. If you have downloaded playlists, and try to switch between them, the songs just never load, and so you cannot access any of your downloaded music",1
Poor playlist function,1
This app is good for listening but this app can't allow another app with listening so please fix this problem for make your app better thank you,5
"Adds song to my playlist and won't let me remove them, THIS APP SUCKS DO NOT GET IT!",1
Spotify keeps crashing in the past hour and i already try to reinstall but it doesnt solve the problem,1
"Quite easy, not at all what I expected. But, as they say never expect have hope.",5
"I mean, I get premium for 10$ so I'm happy. I wouldnt want to pay more though",4
"Ads are too many, too often, and too long. Very annoying and you can't fast forward thru the commercials.",3
"awful app. if you need to buy premium just to play the songs you want, might aswell put Spotify not for free. because i cant even listen to the songs i want to listen and could only skip 6 songs an hour.",1
I love Spotify premium. I get to add whatever songs I like with no ads. And I love that you can download your music to listen offline. This is my second month and I love it.,5
Very good music app,5
"This new update is changing inside the Spotify, everytime I play my liked song, it only play for 10 second only, unlike the old Spotify, everytime I tap my Like song, it always play the full. I want the old Spotify, this new Spotify is bad.",1
This app's ui is worst then any other app. It always show shows you might like with irrelevant content. And we also can't remove the listens and unliked content from the home menu. It shows nudity type shows . And we can't remove this type of shows from our Spotify home menu. I hope you'll understand.,1
Really good music app,5
Multiple charges...each month i get multiple charges for Spotify on my CC...I try to investigate and can NEVER get an answer. There is no email address to which I can request details. Until this is resolved...this will remain at 1 star...less if i could. Update: still no reply from Spotify and there is no easy way to cancel...so I will do a charge back on my c/c...I have uninstalled,1
Best ever app for listening either latest or old songs and also podcasts,5
"I love this app,i think i have seen a music app like this",5
The game is good but if i play my song its not the song i wanted but the app is still good😁,5
I love this I can save the music that I listened 💗,4
Best music experience ever,5
Awesome Features! Amazing music!,4
"The app doesn't even work, as it doesn't allow me to listen to the music I want to listen to, but instead makes me listen to random songs I've never heard before. Most terrible and useless app I have ever seen. And on top of all of this, they prevent you from doing things such as skipping more than six times per hour, and puting songs on repeat, unless of course you're willing to pay. You've lost a user, since money is obviously more important to you than user convinience.",1
Worst app ever can never skip back to your song and if you click play it continues with whatever it skipped to and that's stupid also u can only skip so much times worst app experience ever rating -100,1
Just ads ads and ads . Ads > music 🤮,1
Why does the lyrics share button keep disappearing?,4
"Horrible app, you cant play songs, when you do it just doesnt work, though the ads are not too bad, would rather use youtube because i can CHOOSE what song i want to play, absolute L",1
"Good quaility sound, and easy to acces to.",5
Best app i ever seen but there are not perfect remix version,5
"Ads after every song? Not to mention the ads are priority as they don't take time to load off my CELL DATA, yet the song buffers here and there as loading it's data isn't priority over and data. Oh also nice false advertising, ""get 30 minutes and free after listening to these ads"" I measure the time, and it gets shorter each time, first time it was 27 minutes before an ad, then 22, eventually I measured it lower but can't remember. Good job Spotify, you're throwing yourself away.",1
Good app but ads are so annoying,3
Idk what happens to the app everything I search is just buffering with full network,2
Used to love this but can't even use it now. It doesn't play anything anymore. Says no internet when all other apps working fine on net. All playlists are apparently now empty. I am paying for a service i can't use. NOT HAPPY AT ALL. Fix this now or lose more customers.,1
Thank you so much for fixing the bugs!!!❤️❤️,5
Very cool app because I can not getting back With Another Event and I will be there at about the same as the one I have is a good time to come by and look at your schedule,5
Too many ads..after every song an adds start playing it's very annoying.... And their it is said that after this as you can enjoy 30 minutes uninterrupted music but it's not true......,1
It's good but doesn't work with weak WiFi signals,3
"After I finish hearing all of my song in playlist, it keep playing other songs out of my playlist. And when I skip it will play another songs out of no where and I kindly hate it.",2
I like the app because it is good for listening to music but there is just kn one issue I have I keeps signing me out of my account randomly and it is quite hard to get back into it when does this. Can you please fix that one issue.,2
Works well and customer service is great,5
Easy to use. Have had alot of fun with. Even able to put my podcast on my roku TV.,5
"The app is very good for listening music,but the lyrics spellings are totally mistaked,so please check the issue",4
Listening to my favorite songs is easy and without adds.,5
"Buggy, cumbersome, and lacks standard features. I used to enjoy having all my podcasts in one place, now I need to use your bloated, battery hungry app. Your garbage app autoplays podcasts even with autoplay off. Your garbage app plays ads at annoying times, ruining the moment on many occasions. Hate you Spotify.",1
This is becoming the worst app day by day. After 2 to 3 songs we just hear the advertisement of buying premium spotify . You even don't know how to attract the customers you are just disturbing their enjoyment. we don't want to buy the premium Spotify but still you are just adding advertisement which is disturbing the customers and I am sure that all the customers will delete this app because of this and you have already got 4.3 ratings and it will take no time to convert into 3.,1
"Its a very awsome app and i have got all of my childhoodcollection on your app,i felt so good refreshing my childhood memories,however the drawback is the subscription part.",4
"I can't even play any song I like, like fr when I pick any song and try to play It, It already has this annoying Shuffle Play Button😒",1
All the music you need!,5
"It's amazing, but the ads and can't download part is the only sad thing",3
Excellent music selection,5
They try hard to make the ad paid version useless to tic you off and force you to go premium. I shut the ap off and use other avilable services when it does this.,2
I really really hate the adverts and you can't even mute the volume,1
Best streaming platform,5
Best music platform for sure,5
The Spotify app is very user friendly and the Google Assistant incorporation makes it very easy to play my favourite music wherever I am.,5
There is a great choice of music for the seniors and the quality is good too. Hope we will see more and more choices esp in the traditional indian music categories. Thank you and keep up the entertanment.,5
It is only good on premium or on PC. And if you don't have premium it is just annoying not just with the ads but with just trying to listen to a full song. You can't just go look for a song and play it you have to put it in an album which is on shuffle meaning it just plays them at random unless you have the PREMIUM. Basically just get the free trial and move on or get the PREMIUM.,1
"Still waiting for Podcasts and Canvas feature to be enabled in my country. Nevertheless, good app if you're premium.",4
Every songs N music available .just love it,5
It's awesome app I really love it ..❤,5
"spotify shouldnt add songs to playlists for you, its really annoying and they should make it a setting.",3
Alot better tha i always thought it would be. Whats really neat is this cool way they choose songs for you when ur playlist end . enjiy cause i do.,5
TOO MANYYYYY ADDSSSS.. UNNECESSARY SPOTIFY IS PUTTING ITS OWN ADDS JUST TO CONVINCE US TO PAY. UNACCEPTABLE.,1
Everything I was told about a music getaway as therapy is right on Spotify.... Can't even lie about it. 🎧,5
The app is good and has thousands of songs to choose from including podcasts and other types of audio experiences. The 14 day free trial was nice as the standard premium is only $9.99 making it pretty cheap for the average user.,5
Easy and fun to use credit to the creators of this app,5
Makers of this app you did a good job but for favorites it deletes your song if there is more than 28.I sugest you guys look at what the problem is.The rest of the time it is easy to use and is one of the best music apps ever,4
Please bring back the notif button for offline mode. Huhuhu. i'll give you 5 stars if you do that 😊,5
Anyone having issues with music cutting in and out while hooked to blue tooth?,4
Everythings good expect 2 issues i face. 1 we can arrange tge song in playlist manually. And 2 the worst one is too many ads.even they we can listen 30 minutes which is the biggest lie.you will face ad after every single song and most of the time 2 ads back to back which is too much annoying and mood spoiling most of the time.seems like this app never made to be free. Plz plz just stay on your talks.that will be enough for us hope u understand 🥺🥺 Plz guys like this review so it can be on top,1
Excellent......I request the music.....it gets played. Whatever music. It hasn't been stumped yet.,4
Ads should be limited,4
"Most people are saying its bad for some reasons, but its actually very good, its a very good app for listening to music, songs, podcasts and ect. For me personaly its the best music app that i have ever used.",5
"Amazing app! Always streams well, and the settings are advanced. Would recommend making playlists for those of us that are picky about music lol. If you stream from the artist it will throw other artist's songs in as well.",5
I need help everytime i pick a song i want it plays a different song please fix this bug :(,1
A very nice app worth having by any loving music fan,5
This is so freaking bad. I have tried to play the songs i want but it puts anyother song. Spotify is so OVERRATED. that was an year ago but now spottify is great. I was just dumb im keeping it because its funny,4
Great access to incredible music,5
"Poor Server Performance. Number of ADs have increased, and for the rest of time the app is just ""loading"". My home WiFi is 100mbps and still the app doesn't play without buffering.",1
Logs me automatically into the wrong account and I can't change it. So I can't use my premium membership. So I'm deleting the app. Was a good 4 years.,1
I listen to specific podcasts on this platiform. The android update really seemed to not be a good companion to this app. what i dont like is how this app plays continuously and randomly...there's no way to stop it with out going into Apps and forestopping. it drains my ear buds and battery...cant fast forward or rewind. ..does not track the last podcast you.listened to. i keep trying to mess with the settings but for some reason there are limited setting options in the free version.,2
"I suggest App developers reduce ads! It was too much and it made me quite angry when I only heard about 3 songs and the ad appeared while the ad said: ""You will be listening to music for the next 30 minutes"". It's a lie! But these songs are great! Only minus 2 stars because of Ads. ;))",3
I just love Spotify best for kpop music it is in my heart now ❤️❤️ but ads 🌚 make it less,5
"I like it, find new music all the time",5
there awesome but the only thing that is not good is that you have to have data or internet so if your traveling and don't have data you can't play music.,3
I enjoy listening to my podcast thru Spotify its easy and I enjoy. Just listening with the no video option.,5
So I have had enough of paying premium Spotify when the past 2/3 months everytime I play Spotify and then lock my phone it stops working have been through all my setting. Have been hoping that the updates that I do help but nope. Getting real sick of it,1
7 ads in one go that's too much,1
Best app for music ♥️♥️,5
There are many lengthy ads. only 1 short ad will be appreciated.,2
I love it..its the only music app that i take with me wherever i go,4
I have hundreds of songs but the app just plays the same ones over and over. I can skip ahead to try to play new ones and it can play the same one it did a few songs ago.,1
Upgraded my phone to a s22 plus and now the option of seeing the songs that I have liked by a specific artist is gone. Now I have to search through the artists entire library to find what I want,1
"Best music app there are ads but, you can find those songs which you can't find anywhere",5
Still love it. Top of my charts.,5
When I play the song that I like it played a different song,2
I love this app very much 🥰 I really recommend this app to music lovers ☺️ it's really satisfy to listen songs in this app thank you 😊,5
"Love it tbh, but the ads are straight up annoying😐",4
Very nice aap. Good music app,5
"😢😢😢😤😤😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬Ads,,Ads,ads, ads ,and data data Full resived, don't open 👐",1
To many ads,4
Somehow you managed to have a consistently inconsistent experience between app and desktop app. Why can't I open my Friends Mix even after adding it to my library??? Why are Blend stories only accessible in the app???,2
Not sure what time to change the same thing nevermind it mean when your base is so beautiful,5
It's pretty neat. I sometimes get random ad drops during the middle of a song. The app that can be downloaded is a bit janky for chrome. Still a pretty good service tho.,4
Contacted the support team and they resolved my lyrics issue in few days! Thank you!,5
Love listening to music all the time,5
Spotify is the best app,5
"first off this app isn't free at all i mean with features like being able to skip 6 songs per hour,pushing songs in your playlist by force, and not being to play exat song one by one in your favorite list and not being able to making a song go forward or anything you are forcing users to buy the premium. Don't even let me start it on ads that you have to listen to 3 or 2 ads after two songs .i think you write down LIMITED ACCESS instead of FREE USE.",2
"I HATE IT that Spotify has to add their horrible recommendations to my playlist! This is absolutely stupid and plays songs from artists I don't even care about. I made a playlist to listen to 1 artist only, not a mix of unrelated artists. No wonder people are deleting your stupid app when you do things like this.",1
"Has just about every artist or song I am looking for. Makes personalized playlist and stations just for me.keeps up with the 13,000 songs I have",5
Awesome I love it the various options to choose from,5
"Many years already, also they helped me out with a hack that subscribed to premium when I lived in a country with no spotify.",5
This is awesome with no adds.. I rate this 5stars,5
Outstanding music app! Ads are one thing but amazing spirit overall,5
Cannot properly play filter saved songs.,4
Superb This app is Full clash of my dipression I'm happy when I'm install this app,5
When i study i will show it and it's main good point is when our device is off ....no prblm Song will play🥰🥰❤️,5
"Best invention ever and if you are not on Spotify, I don't know what you are doing with your life.",5
No ads mean no ads yet they still push music calling it a new release when it's just an paid ad for some random song. It's like some other streaming sites like Paramount Plus. They take your money for no-ad plan and run their own promos before the actual content. Promo is an ad!,1
"Cant pick what you want, Forces songs you dont want on playlists, Etc... It's very bad",1
"this app is good, but sometimes there are bugs, like recently the buttons are kind of not in their right positions which is weird lol.",5
Best among any other music app,5
There was no lyrics even after I updated and now fed up with this app please fix this,1
Not suitable for all languages..,2
I love how the podcast is being played on it smoothly. Thank you very much,5
Best way to find new music or similar music to what you like already,5
I can't see folders containing playlists on Galaxy watch because folders are not shown,1
The app is not working,5
I love this app it's amazing I love Blackpink and it has concert experience I love this .,5
"This app has all the song of the world but it don't have a song by Sidhu mossewala named syl :satluj , yamuna link , now it is banned but when it was released then it come on Spotify . Why?????",4
Too much ads,1
"What happen, Spotify?? Its really good before but now dhhdhdhdhssh.......first i unfollow some artist/s then the number of my following doesn't change at all.....Second I create a playlist but the song I didn't put to it actually play please fix it, thank you!!",1
Great app. Wish I could add multiple tracks from a playlist at the same time to another playlist. It's very annoying having to do this on a pc and not on my phone.,4
I paid Rs.25 today for a week to get premium A/C but I did not get any message and adds did not stop Resolve immediately,3
"This app is great. I like it, the music is up to date and the quality is good as well.",5
Thank u sm for adding premium mini,5
It also includes songs of different strings.,5
I love Spotify it plays really good music,5
"I didn't pay for Spotify premium but it was fine with do many ads but now I can on preview my Playlist what is this. Spotify was better before and now everything needs a premium so that's the reason I am leaving Spotify. And you need premium to skip songs, what is this Spotify I am damn mad right now.",1
Cool app i'd say but too much with ads its too interrupting and aouto shuffle really isn't cool but its alright,3
The experience has been amazing you even create your own playlist which is so nice and listen to podcasts and etc but sometime personally me it has some of it's glitches but it's amazing,4
You better update my spotify to have my karaoke or else I'll change this into one star.,5
Been with Spotify for years now and love it the app is amazing especially on tvs great services 👏 really impressed with it done a good job especially the premium listening i to offline where ever i go its amazing 2022: recently with the new update the sound quality has gotten quiter and idk y it must be to due with the update I compared it with sound cloud same song and on sound cloud its louder. Spotify can u please fix this.,5
"Very outstanding app for songs, podcasts : ) :D",5
Spotify has too much ad on a single song pls fix that ad .,5
Love this app and the generated daily mixes loving it come on 1 month free .....give 6 months get loads of custom people don't use it every minute of every day .....make it so you can pay for a week or even a day like pay as you go,5
"The app is great I guess, it is complicated to use but you get used to it overtime I guess but I get an ad between EACH spng like rach and every song ans i get like 3 ads in a row like come on bro that's way too much I hate it so much it's super frustrating..",1
It is the best music app in playstor,5
Deleting this app. Thumbs down for introducing ads.,1
"It sucks, you can barely listen to the music you want because of shuffle, you only get 6 skips, on pc its good so i am giving 2 stars, and ads just ruin the experience, not even youtube or sound cloud has that many ads and in those you can skip as much as you want",2
"It's a great app after all but one problem,everytime I try to listen to an album that I want,it plays a random album and I hate when this happens,I try to listen to my play list but it plays a random song,please sort this issue out because this is making me upset.",3
All Favorite Super audios are available @Spotify,5
None of my spotify playlist have music in them I have Uninstalled twice and still no joy pretty upset as I've been premium payer for quite a long time,1
A wonderful music experience,5
I really love this app but it's that I don't like that fact the it mixes ny like songs,3
"You are the best thing when it comes to music. Music saved my life, and a lot of others that I know. But innovative is the way to think with this app.",5
"Terrible update, I made playlists for to pick specific songs I'd like to listen, now forced to use shuffle. I can't drag the timestamp too, no freedom at all. - edit Wow I can't even play the song I've search SPECIFICALLY, nice. :-)",1
Spotify is the best thing since sliced 🍞,5
more ads in songs,3
"Everything thing is fine except I can't login back because it's saying no Internet. Also It works fine In Laptop ,only in phone shows no internet while searching songs and show nothing in search.",3
Best app to listen to music. I woykd pick Spotify over any other music apps out there,5
This app is very nice but sometimes their are so many ads And sometimes I can't play my playlists like if i play a song from my playlists then the second song will not pla from my playlists plz try to repair it,4
Spotify fell off like u can't forward the song and can't skip the song more then 6 times an hour and to top this all off u can't play a specific song and when they say listen to uninterrupted music for 30 mins after watching the short video they only play 10 minutes of music,1
"How is there not an option to remove certain tabs like ""shows to try""or ""stay up to date""? The whole point of spotify is finding music that you like. I don't want to be spammed with the newest Trap or Pop or whatever. It is seriously off-putting.",1
That was good experience🤭 but my mom doesn't allow me to listen songs thats why I delete it 🤣,5
I can find almost anything I want to listen to.,5
Excellent app! I'll keep it for life!,5
Endless loading screen when trying to listen to downloaded songs whilst offline?,1
My favourite music app is Spotify,5
I have Spotify premium and its anamzing app with or without it. I love listening to my favorite songs on here. I love that I can connect it to my Alexa speaker so I can play music to go to sleep to. I love the display arrangement and the ability to follow artists. This app has so many songs and artists. Ever since I got Spotify its been the only app I use to listen to music or podcasts. Love the app!!!,5
"My issue is that I not able to listen to the podcast episodes that I downloaded. Every day I go into "" your episodes "" section, and I see that the ' downloaded' mark is not there, even though I have re-download them yesterday. Could you kindly tell me why is it so? What's the point of downloading podcast episodes, when you have to re-download them every single day ? Other features are working just fine.",2
"Only Givin' 3 stars coz, Can't listen music offline",3
What's with the automatic pausing?,1
"Great app for the last 5 years. Lots has been improved upon but other things... (such as the totally unnecessary removal of the home screen widget for Android users as of 8/7) ..have been not so great. For anyone interested, Google ""Spotify widget removal"" and look for the most recent thread posted by the official Spotify team. Reading the comments there will give you an insight to just how asinine removing this feature was. I will add back two stars to this review once this feature is re-added.",5
"Still giving ads after subscribing to premium membership. Audacious, disgusting, pathetic!",1
I love this app it's a great way to listen to music and express yourself the only thing is I wish you didn't have to pay so much to get rid of ads cos the ads are really annoying. Other than that it's amazing,4
The best platform for music now. I often forget I have a music player on my phone,5
"Hate everything. I hate the navigation, can't see the full playlist sometimes. Just want to find Moshpit by Que Violette, but its shuffled in a playlist. Just no. Not good for music, like I wish artists and podcasters would uoload somewhere else, Spotify SUCKS.",1
Great app to listen to your favourite music.,5
It is funny and amazing. I like this so much😁🤗,5
Love it can find some really obscure recordings. I will be upgrading to to premium.,5
It really sucked to have it without unlimited though it was nice to play over other apps u could do that and more with other apps I will probably soon find something better,2
Great app...simple and easy to use. I like it.,5
It's an amazing app and I guess there is a new feature in it like a karaoke one and I love it but I can't find the option now can you guys please bring it back but otherwise its a great app I am living it .,5
When I play my playlist random songs play that I don't even know,1
WAY TOO MUCH RESTRICTING. I can't no longer play my favorite songs a lot of times it's because its playing a different song I don't like!! PLEASE I need you to make another update that is better.,1
"Nice app, but advertisements are annoying and can be disturbing",3
I love spotify it has all my favorites,5
"This latest update is awful! I mostly listen to podcasts and almost every time there is a commercial, that has its own time bar, this app marks the episode as done, deletes my spot, marks the episode as done, and moves me to the next. Other times, episodes with no commercials just end, often times with over an hour left in them. It just skips to the next episode, marks my current one as finished, and deletes my spot. edit: Fixed",4
It adds terrible music to your own playlist without permission,1
Music kept me entertained very much ☺️☺️😜😜😜😜,5
Best free music and postcard app,5
Pay for premium & Podcast still have automatic ads on top of a podcasts sponsor too. We are entering the age of none stop ads.,2
"Awful, Spotify enables annoying features like autoplay without telling you. Also, after completing the song you were listening to, it gives ""related"" songs that aren't even slightly related to the original genre.... Best yet, you can't even disable it no matter how hard you try. There are some ways to fix this but that's just so much hassle to basically just listen to a regular ol music player on loop.",1
Love the music from different artists all over the world.,5
Love you Spotify....You are my everything!!!!,5
"Quite cool and interesting,so far good I can recommend other funs to install it",4
It's easy to get music on Spotify,5
Keeps all my music but minor ajusents need to be made,4
"We need a ""play last"" option to add a song in the queue. Pleeeeeeeese",5
The phone version of the app is frustratingly dumb. Can't play songs in any order and only on shuffle?? I'm definitely sticking to PC and tablet only.,2
lyrics do not show. + random songs i do not know get added in my playlists and play while i'm listening to my playlist. FIX IT!!!!!!,3
it is number one in my eyes it hits top charts with music artisist you like all variety music that is great listening app i love it !,5
The best music app....♡💜🐰,5
So many problems on this app.Please remove the problems..,1
"So money hungry, forcing me to pay premium just so I can skip more songs and listen to the ones I want listen too smh",1
Need more skip option,3
When I first learned about Spotify. I tried it and I was very happy. Because I listen to music all the time. It relaxes my soul. You have a variety of music to choose from. And how ever list you want to make. Since my husband passed away. My Spotify got cut off . My funds were short couldn't afford it. I was going crazy. The other apps I didn't care for them . I had to have my Spotify. So who's ever ready this try it. Believe me you'll love it. Now I pay it up for three months at a time. Mrs W.,5
Great selection of music and other audio media but app will stop play between songs or drop out during one.,3
I am a big fan of spotify but it would be great if you could reduce the ads.,4
Spotify is easier to use than Pandora and has a much better selection of music,4
All and every tune imaginable,5
Finding the play controls should never be an issue but with this app it annoyingly is. Solution: quit the app.,2
I can't even play my Playlist like I wanted it to be,1
"It's a good app, but sometimes it just stops playing the songs. All in all, I love this app.",3
"Great service , gets better each month",5
It has improved my ability for therapy and it's helped me through life and it's good beats and positive and really good stuff to listen to and I recommend,5
Works great I even play music off line,4
"I really enjoyed using this app. But, can you add romaji lyrics for japanese/korean songs? I'm pretty sure it will make it easier for people to enjoy music more. Thankyou ☺️❤️‍🩹",5
"Ads are too annoying, the algorithm for displaying ads is broken for sure. It says after the ads next 30 mins are free and after every song showing ads and and saying same thing.",2
i cant play any song that i want you better fix it to have 5 stars from me,1
really good wish we could do more stuff without having premium,4
an awsm song streaming app the best of all like the bestttt...... ✓✓,5
"The overall experience is good. Asian songs, especially Chinese songs have less resources. The UI of the lyrics display module can be more beautiful.",5
"has some great xontent, layout pretty good. problem: regularly updates break functionality - sometimes the update breaks it so it no longer shows up on phone as playing, sometimes it won't pause, and will keep playing. sometimes it won't play.",2
"Its a good music app,if you have premium but this is my go to music app",4
I truly love listening to all of my playlists on this app. I dislike the amount of ads though.,5
Best music platform. Very classic.,5
"Too bad, I can't log in when I am in different country. People like me who is in different country in short period of time has no use of this app.",1
"This app is 100% one that I cannot live without on my phone. If you have premium, your experience is highly enhanced and refined to your tastes. This is my favorite music app.",5
I played the list of songs that I added to my favourites but this app played other songs too that are not in this list. Please fix this.,3
"I left Spotify for Tidal a while back, and returned to Spotify a month ago to find it has improved immensely.",5
I never had Spotify till about a month ago & I enjoy everytime I use it. 5 star all the way.,5
You used to be able to set up a playlist even without prime. But these days no go without them shoving their own songs onto your playlist. You also can't repeat a song or playlist. Pandora is looking better and better. You also can't see your playlist without moving back and pushing 5 buttons. It makes you work too hard. Very frustrating.,1
"Superb app,but if you add shuffle option for playlists,it will be more helpful.Thankyou",4
It's good for music use it almost every day it's confusing how to change plans but it's fine alot of different music and it recommends hood artist from my taste I've told my friends about it I love it easy to work easy to look for music alot of ads if you have standard edition so I would recommend premium,5
"Okay so I've been trying to play some music but I doesn't work and plays a random song. It all started when I was in my like list and I was trying to play a song but a different song would be playing instead of the song I wanted. I made a new account and the same thing happened so now I can't listen to the music I want to hear, instead some random song that isn't even in my likes. I was trying to play the song 'Misery Meat"" but, it didn't work and a random song appeared.Please fix this I hate it",2
"I love the app, but for some reason my music is skipping when played through my bluetooth earbuds. #Edit: Uninstalling and reinstalling the app fixed the problem.",3
Very good app just needs some minor tweaking in the consistency of audio quality however other than that adds are minimal for non paying. Users and premium is worth its price.,4
"Great, except I can't figure out how to download. Nothing works, been googling, trying for 5 minutes. I'm baffled.",3
"Nice App, we can listen all type of songs , without mobile screen on",5
"It's good and all, but now ads are over a minute long, and no matter what Spotify adds songs into your playlists and it's annoying. This app is never going to be worth $10/month. Back to Youtube Music it is. Spotify has disappointed me AGAIN.",2
"Songs very good but these 3, 4 weeks it is creating very irritating cause each and every song ending contain advertise ments it's very difficult and bad experience listening 🎶 😢 😔",1
The app is great and I love how I have custom playlists. But I don't know why lyric option has never worked for me. It's available on my pc but not on my phone. I'd be glad if this gets fixed,4
"It's alright, I just don't know what to say but I know something isn't intriguing me. I don't know I think old Spotify is better 🤔",4
1 song. ONE SONG BEFORE ANOTHER AD IS PLAYED! You greedy pigs.,1
It's a great app but when I tried to listen to a song it started playing a different one I tried to delete and install it again but it kept happening please help,4
It shuffle to song I didn't want listen,1
Music. Glad I found Spotify!!,5
Worst app for listening music.... there's always an ad after each and every music... can't listen music while running and exercising till u purchased membership.....,1
The low quality sound is alright on a phone of equal quality.,1
"Smooth app, but as of the left few days Spotify just freezes when I open it. Hope this is fixed soon! Also, a fast-forward/rewind button would be great!",3
"worst music app that I used till date......more ads than music.......non sense app.....don't install it, if you don't want to waste your time and money",1
Because it won't play the right song and I don't wanna pay,1
"Travelling in and out of service, like I do daily, creates trouble. I'm not skipping a ton of songs, and when I do it's usually music I have already downloaded. It still creates minutes of time where the app can't function. I shouldn't have to be checking my app when I'm driving, no matter where I am. Also, I have had five replacement phones since I committed to Spotify for life. Every time, it forgets my preference to never have the visuals. I shouldn't have to turn this off on an audio app.",1
Been using Spotify as my primary source for streaming music for roughly 8 years now. I've even started my own channel. Only one thing I can't figure out how to delete a private Playlist,5
"Slowly this app is becoming useless, it is free, so what if there is a limit for ads too?",1
Very nice to listen your songs,5
I love to listen songs on spotify,5
After the new update there are ads on every touch... Spotify is getting worse every other day,1
Good selection and making my own playlists is perfect,5
Spotify started off great but...days later came out bad it won't let me listen to my favorite song on favorites list.and it only makes me shuffle :(,1
"I wish I started on Apple Music or YT music. Spotify shuffle plays the same songs all the time. I have about 1000 songs and it always plays the same 50 on shuffle. The push podcasts everywhere, your feed is mainly podcasts. The only reason I havent switched is because its hard to transfer so many songs to another platform.",3
Smooth jazz easy to use,5
Glitchy as hell. I'm constantly restarting the app because it freezes. Basically unusable on my LG V60. Time to cancel?... Get it fixed or get bent. Update: I have now canceled Spotify due to their total lack of interest in fixing their garbage app.,1
Could use an explanation why I need service to listen to things I have downloaded...ya know....because that's why people download them????,1
e we do jukn ede u u vv a clip to paste it in the text box.Tap on a clip to buy saved here.u call wi,5
"When I first got to use Spotify I thought it was great. Then,the ads started to appear. I understand that they have to make money but there are way too many commercials.",4
Spotify is one of the most amazing applications for me. all songs are available in the app and I loved it..,5
App has been randomly pausing my playlist for the past couple of days. Please fix this.,3
A lot of ads but very good 😊👍,5
"With every update this app seems to get worse. Frequent crashes are very annoying. Often when I pick something to play, the app will say ""Spotify is trying to play..."" but it is playing the audio I want, but without the controls to pause/fast-forward/rewind being available. To fix this I have to close the app multiple time and re open it. Spotify is awesome, but the app flat out sucks now.",2
I like Spotify but one problem is that when I want to to hear one song it shows an album and i can't hear the music i want to hear and on the playlists too pls fix this,3
Easiest apps to find latest songs,5
"i really enjoy Spotify music it keeps my spirit up on a daily basis,",5
"Way too many ads, a non premium user has to struggle to listen to any songs. Not even 30mins you'll get ad less listening.",3
A OPTION SHOULD BE THERE WHEN WE SEARCH SONGS IN SEARCH BAR THERE IS NO OPTION TO ADD SONFS DIRECTLY FROM THERE INTO A PLAYLIST.,4
Best music app ever. So fine you have to pay for it. But it's the best.,5
My experience is that i have never used a music app that is so pleasant like Spotify before.,5
Super good quality sounds,5
Its good minus all the ads,4
"Enjoy Spotify but just wish the ""lyrics"" option would work on my Samsung Tab S tablet.",5
Would be awesome if no ads. Nothing but a bother. Cable tv is just the same,4
I've paid for this for a while and the moment the payment is late or didn't go through for bank or centrelink reasons it goes back to please update payment. Maybe Spotify needs to improve that for it's regular and long term customers. I won't be using Spotify anymore,3
"I'm glad the pause button got changed back to where it was before. However, I've been trying to do this new super grouper thing, it glitches out when you search for an artist and no names come up (my internet has full bars so it's not that). I clicked off it to retry it a few times but it's completely disappeared now. So I have no way of taking part now. I love Spotify but at the moment I'm giving it 3 stars because every update has something buggy in it.",3
I can't open the app. It's stuck on the start-up screen(or logo screen). I've installed and uninstalled the app a few times already and it still won't budge.,1
Good music good set up,4
"One little bug where what was playing wouldn't come up, preventing the ability to pause. Fixed quickly, and been absolutely great otherwise.",5
"Great way to peruse discographies of artists that I love. The (Artist) Radio versions of playlists is better than Pandora's giving more suggestions of similar artists. I love the lyrics feature. It helps to quell the need for a larger & more robust content usually only on a Vinyl LP (still my pref for total package). Love that 12"" format. ;) I'd like to see links to buy any album or single currently playing. Let's give back $$$$$ to the creators of this music & keep this great app sustainable!!",5
"Love this app. Unfortunately the volume is too low, especially when I wear earphones. Please fix this problem!",4
spotify can extract local files in sd card storage for offline listening,5
Constantly tries to ram music I've never heard or know I don't like into my playlists. Eventually it ended up purely random. I would never ever pay money for an app on the odd chance it might improve the function. I hate this app,1
"let me re-arrange my liked songs playlist, or add an ""are you sure?"" message before hiding/unliking a song",2
"Awesome layout and very easy on the eyes, love it and recommend for those who love there music loud. Thank you.",5
"Get the premium, it's the best tenner I've ever spent",5
"Easy to use, Playlist are a breeze with the library and suggestions.",5
Spotty is the best! They have all my favorite music.,5
"The app is very nice, I mean better than the other music streamer apps. It has everything a gamer wants. It has relaxing music to calm you down while having a battle and it also has music to motivate you when you are about to lose. For example- I was loosing hopes because all of my squad members were dead and I was the only one alive then a motivational song played from my playlist and I finished the whole enemy squad",5
I hate the ads but it's good and plus u can turn off ur device and it still work god bless please can u remove some ads maby at least 2 ads thank you,4
Good for making playlists,3
Great music app!!!,4
"I've used spotify for the last few years and loved it, but the last few weeks have been clunky-songs randomly stopping and the music and plays when it says nothing is playing. It's quite annoying you cant adjust anything because nothing is ""playing"".",1
Best streaming service ever!,5
I really enjoy the discover weekly playlist.,5
Getting any kind of support on the app is not happening.,1
Great I drive thru the mountains with no cell service and listen to my music the whole way. 100% satisfied!!!!!,5
"No way to sort a Playlist by least recently played. Lots of requests for this. No fix year after year. They can do it they just choose not to. Still the same, 5 years in",1
"Absolutely invaluable!! Where else can you have at your finger tips a world of music, pod casts and more? Absolutely invaluable. 👍",5
I love this app bc I can use it for trips,5
"Not as easy to use compared to pc, and tge mobile app missing some features, the price does not fit the bill. Seems im not the only one that seen through spotify fog... Doesn't give you 30 minutes of free listening also nor does it give you the 6 song skip as feature... Misleading.... The Playlist they suggest is crusty and obsolete. Cheers worse app to hit the mobile store take your bs of the platform you failing pakehas old fools",1
"Very good app, I would recommend you download",5
Im trynna listen to music (not ads).,3
I have been missing music and didn't know it!,5
I can listen to my music without having to click anything besides the play button.,5
I love tgis is free and so many song it's awesome,5
I thoroughly enjoy listening to my own music here on Spotify.,5
"This app is amazing but now I see a problem. One day I was going to listen to spotify but it said no connection. THIS has been happening fir the last 3 weeks or so. But after a couple of tries I re downloaded it and it won't let me in due to ""no connection"". Please help",3
I love the music options and dont mind the ads would give this app a 5 star but sometimes when im listening to music and it would turn it self off in the middle of a match or a tournament and restarts the music and pauses it forcing me out of my game just to turn it on again then when it switches to another music it stop again just annoying and would like to play my games with music on helps me relax be sides that its a good app,3
"I love Spotify. Its the best thing ever. But suddenly out of nowhere my volume is all screwed up. Its ONLY spotify. YouTube, facebook, etc works fine, but spotify just sounds horrible and the volume is so low even when i have it turned all the way up :(",5
"Annoying ads. Shuffles your playlist, and you have ""daily skips"" for free listeners like me.",2
honestly it started good but then went downhill but you get what you get ig,3
Been using Spotify since day one,5
"Aggressively asks for new permissions, insults you if you say no. No way to provide feedback or get support, even as a ""premium"" subscriber. A few years ago they wiped my collection of liked songs with no warning. Otherwise it's okay. I don't recommend ""premium"", all it means is fewer ads, you'll still be treated like dirt.",2
spotify is a really good app to hear music if you like to :) but they might not have all the songs you like.,4
"Used to love every bit of the app with premium but the 'good morning etc' banner at the top with 'recent' listening activity hasnt refreshed in months now, their support page shows its been a known issue for a long time but still no fix. Every time I open the app its just the face of an artist i listened to once and didnt even like staring at me which gets me irritated again so I dont even like opening the app anymore.",2
Love being able to listen to music from the 1920s to the 2020s.,5
"Songs don't play, sometimes app doesn't show the song being played just audio and it's very glitchy. Using it on OnePlus 8T+",1
It would help the app to have better playlist management. 1. Currently in the app there's no one place where I can find all of my playlists (or I don't see it). My playlists gets mixed up with all of the other playlists I have liked. 2. I might want to add a song to multiple playlists. We should be able to select all the playlists we want to add the song at once. Either check boxes by default or long press for check boxes. 3. Custom order option for library too.,4
Rubbish app..I have been facing trouble logging in since last 15 days..Who will provide compensation for 15 days premium I lost?? And God knows How many days it is going to continue..,1
I hate this update it make the playlist on suffle and i HATE IT,1
Greatest music streaming app besides the quality of files its perfect,5
"The horrible bug has been fixed, finally. Other than that, I really like Spotify. It streams well, it has all the music I like, there are plenty of podcasts I like and it connects with the devices I have.",4
My sibling and I both don't have premium yet I seem to get a LOT more ads than they do. I get ads maybe every two or three songs while they can listen to ten songs without a single ad interrupting it. This is incredibly annoying.,2
Can not download some of the songs that I want to add to my playlist but other than that it's ok,3
"Great variety; interesting Pod Casts; easy to find music for any event, time, or mood",5
"Is very organized, has lots to chose from, both podcasts and songs. Paying for Premium is definitely worth it!",5
Very good app for music listeners,5
I love how I can make my own play list.,5
Just get rid of the Disney and all will be great for me and maybe more. I don't like hearing the same ads all the time. But you still get 5 stars.,5
App broken with most recent update.,1
"This is a really good app, helps me relax but, not having premium literally kills me inside because instead of playing my playlist, I get suggested songs that 1: I don't want to listen to 2: Just let me listen to what I wanna listen to I don't want to give you money to listen to music when I can do that on a pc with youtube. Edit: just delete suggested songs for the love of god",3
Good use easy song,5
"Awesome, fuan and easy.",5
Spotify sucks so bad they just want to push premium and shove ads up peoples butts. youtube premium is a much better deal than spotify,1
"I always cut off promos before I start having to pay, most I'll do is 9.99 for a couple months. You guys provide hate content in podcasts, so you deserve no premium users or money. Remember the customers can make or break a company. You're free to have whoever you want, but we as customers, don't have to support you anymore. Lose customers, you lose profit. Simple. You'll profit as much as Truth Social and other clown sites. That's why ya'll had to turn to shareholders. They won't help you",1
DUSCUSTANG YOU CAN NOT CHANGE WHILE LISTENING TO A SONG AND YOU CANT PICK A SPECIFIC SONG IT HAS TO BE SHUFFLED,1
It was good in the begging but the random song thing ruined it and we have to pay,1
I cant download all songs evenn when i have a premium subsecribe,3
"My complaint is consistent with other people, glitches for months now and has not been fixed and no refund. For such an expensive service, I am not paying for a consistently glitchy service.",1
"ILY SPOTIFY. You're the best thing istg. The legit thing keeping my alive rn, ily <3 Although. Please stop playing sticker by nct127 and Fever by jyp when I'm having a mental breakdown <3",5
"Fix random crashes, you are multimilion dollar company, you can afford it",1
The app won't play my favourite songs,2
It keeps not playing the exact songs I want,1
Could you add a way to see old version of made for you playlists like discover weekly? Sometimes I forget to like songs before the playlist refreshes.,5
It contains too much ads... Sometimes it causes headache... That's why I ranked it 1/5...,1
All of the sudden it's now 6 skips per hour but prior i had no problem skipping songs or playing what I wanted.,1
"I have always adored spotify! I pay for premium, but I must say the whole ""hide this song"" option is getting really annoying being right beside save and add to Playlist. I have accidentally hid songs I've been trying to save and add to playlist",3
It's an amazing music application. Its having all latest music.,5
Great for older folks like myself.,5
"The app is good but what bothered me was I can't download songs from the app in order to play offline when there's no data,, please do something about it , please!!",3
"This app is trash, it never works have the time weather it's the UI going out, or lack of internet connection (even with full bars somehow???) Funny thing is I figured buying it would stop it , nope save your 11 dollars I'm going back to Pandora, the true og music player",1
Awesome .... missing Joni Mitchell and a few others.,4
Too many ads,1
My experience with Spotify is top shelf # 1 period point blank.,5
"I used to love this app, it's very relaxing & u can pick any song u want. But I'm very disappointed on the new update, it doesn't let u skip some part of the song & it also won't let u pick any song u like, it will just played a random song. I CANT EVEN PLAY MY OWN PLAYLIST CUZ OF THE SHUFFLE, very disappointing but I'm still hoping the next time y'all update this app, pls remove the shuffle thing & the part when it won't let u skip some part of the song. I hope y'all understand :)",1
"The app is good, but recently, when I wanted to unsubscribe from the premium plan, I was faced with one problem. When I push ""cancel premium"" I see that message: ""Application error: a client-side exception has occurred"" idk how to fix this, there's no such topics on the forum...",4
"Its a good app for music and all but when you tell me ""half an hour of free music"" then make me listen to a playlist of songs you suggested me that i hate and you get 6 skips unless you pay despite you making me listen to this ear assault i dont get why i should rate this app any higher. If i search a song i want THAT song not some random song because i dont understand how i can go from listening to rap to you ""suggesting me"" binding by the lights. Fix or remove your song suggestions",2
Poor app only ads are coming in this.. waste of data. Very poor,1
"Despite being a new installation on a phone less than a month old, it has started having the same issues I was having on my previous phone. It will randomly stop playing and show 'nothing playing' rather than the podcast or song I have had on. It has also stopped showing the now playing strip, meaning I am unable to pause or skip, only stop and play. Closing the app and reopening doesn't help, uninstalling only works for a few days if I am lucky.",1
Nyc app I really just wish we could be able to download a couple of songs on the free bundle for those of us who can't afford paid,4
I love that I can lock the screen and put my phone in my pocket and keep listening to my favorite podcasts and channels.,4
"I do lots and lots of driving and I love music, so that means I listen to a lot of music. Spotify is a great app other than the fact that they don't know how to shuffle. I have repeats all the time on playlist that I know are days long. It's quite annoying for me to click one of my playlists and have repeats within the first couple hours.",1
I just want to be able to delete some of the songs that use to listen to because the person who made that song did something absolutely terrible and I don't wanna be able to look at their songs and remember what they did 🧍🏾‍♀️,4
Spotify is the best I couldn't live without their music,5
"The best music service I have ever used. Spotify Premium is the only way I listen to music. At first it is like a big box if your favorite songs, but after you start filling your favorites list, and selecting artists you want to follow, it will blow your mind.",5
"This is a great app! But only if you have the premium version, the free version is awful and I hate this app for it! Spotify sucks. DO NOT GET!",1
"Shearing my honest review,I am a story hunter, wherever I get it I just try to grab it as faster as I can,so this app does grt job to me.....I have been looking something like this,...So for me this is best",5
"Great app, love listening to music I choose.",5
Love the access to a variety of podcasts.,4
Almost perfect. I'm having issues with my payment. Please I need this fixed ASAP. I have tried everything,3
Love this app. So great that offers a family plan so we can all enjoy the music we love.,5
It's great and wonderful using Spotify! I love and recommend it! May God bless the developer!,5
"Amazing, Thank you Spotify for all the great music, old and new..AMAZING",5
Love it easy to use...great selection of songs,4
I like it the Spotify is cool,5
I love Spotify because when u go to YouTube to listen to music u can exit the app and listen. But with spotify u can do that so that's why Spotify is a good app,5
I love Spotify plays all my music,5
"keep showing really explicit content in the home, even when the filter is activated. cant remove the podcast section from home.",1
Love the app but only problem is that I'm a student and idk if I wanna spend on an app rn. Otherwise 30mins and like 1 min ad is pretty good for a free song player cuz YouTube has HAS soooo many Ads. Solid 9/10.,4
Is a very good app is just sometimes when it say enjoy the next 30 minute add free in like 5 minutes is another add,5
Amazing app coz it provides all songs without any difficulty to found them . 😍😍,5
I hate Spotify. The app keeps adding songs to my Playlist that I don't want and won't let me remove them.,1
Great but trouble removig songs,5
"Spotify is my go to music streaming platform. It's very easy to create playlists. Only two requests I have of Spotify on next update. Do the Youtube thing where you can add a song to multiple playlists at once. And, make Russian Doll playlists. As in, so you can make an ultimate playlist. Anytime I add a song to these playlists, it automatically adds to this other overarching playlist. That would simplify things a lot so I'm not constantly having to manage all my different playlists.",4
Great app but yk the ads 🥲. I really love this app and I've already recommend to my frnds. I dont wanna loose this app. But can please reduce a few of the ads please.,5
Too many ads.,1
"Fix the bugs. Crashing, podcast episodes not playing after one another and the few times they do, jumping all over the place. Notifications for podcasts are either non existent or show up a week late. Music UI is clumsy and weirdly organized",2
"I love Spotify and use it incredibly often. However the mobile app on my Note 10+ has been a point of constant frustration since I downloaded it. I have issues with playback stopping for no apparent reason. The controls to pause/resume, skip, repeat, etc. sometimes just disappear from the notification center and in the app itself, along with several other issues. Spotify is great on Windows, but the mobile app on the Play Store has been less than stellar for the majority of my time using it.",2
I can't open Spotify on my phone because Google smart lock won't show it to even when it's disabled.,1
App can't not open without shutting down my phone. I've tried changing my password restarting my phone removing Google smart lock redownloading the app several times and nothing helps. Does not open the app at all!,5
"Needs a Lite version - takes up A LOT of memory and space. Downloading, (premium feature), is very cumbersome - you can't even download a single song without adding it to a playlist first. Free version if you click 'no thanks' to watch an ad they play a longer one. Once I find another option for podcasts I'll cut myself free of this app.",1
Nice app but premium adds are not good,4
Best music app I've ever had!,5
"Still a rubbish app. Still had a bug even after an update. Time to find a new podcast app. This app has a bug. Plays podcasts, but there are no controls at the bottom. If you shut the app down the podcast still plays. To get this app to work as it should you have to turn your phone off and restart it, however after a short time it happens all over again. PLEASE SORT IT OUT.",1
Its kool with no comercials but it gets lost puts you in music your not playin plus whem your playing music sometimes it sounds like its spitting at you spotify aka spitify🤣,3
"Love it!! Thousands of tracks to listen to. From easy listening to heavy metal!! 👍👍 Please stop adding recommendations to my play list, it's getting tiresome removing them. If I want a song, I'll look for it myself 🤘",5
"Fantastic app paying for premium is worth it, the only problem I'm having is synching to my car still 5 ⭐",5
"Amazing app, overall, maybe could try to get some more songs :>",5
Good music and podcasts. Easy to access and use.,5
Not able to login in any way,1
"This is my main app for streaming music and I've loved it since the beginning but lately it just stops playing. I've closed all my apps, I restarted the app, my phone is about a year old flagship samsung phone so it's not the hardware. I have the individual plan and pay on time. I don't know why it cuts out but it's becoming annoying.",3
Paying them from india is a great hassle,3
I love my Spotify premium family plan! I like making my own Playlist and the suggestions Spotify generates are many times spot on,5
Too much irritated adds,1
"It has been working really well for me, you can set it up to play the way you want it to , i be using the sleep timer at nights i love it!",5
"I have been Spotify user for about 5 years now. I love the application on desktop and web but the mobile app is where it gets the 3 stars. ""Car View"" was a feature that existed up until 2021 where it was ultimately removed in November. This was a SIGNIFICANT FEATURE for users without the newer car play and android auto. This feature single handedly improved safety when driving as the buttons were big enough to press. This was not a good change.",3
"Awesome app for songs 🎵 👌. I love it so much that I have more than 2000 songs in my Playlist and liked one's I recommend this app for for kids,adults and old ones .....everyone would love it .but just reduce the ads plz the only reason I'm giving 1 stars less is of the reason having so much ads rather than songs. Its like a 3 ads per 2 songs of a ratio and moreover there are some songs u can't search which needs to be uploaded..",4
"Lot's of adds, that collapse mind while hearing songs.",1
Useless. Keeps skipping to the next podcast after a couple of min.,1
"Well I like to know that I can simply open my phone,and go to Sportify and be entertained! listing to all genres of music.",4
Theres a lot of adds and sometimes randomly startes playing but its still a goood pp,3
Won't let me play the song I want to listen to.,1
Best music app ever!!,5
Best songs and playlists,5
Love the wide variety of music. Sucks to only have 6 skips per hour but it's free so thank you.,5
I love how this works. It's smooth and I know I can count on it even when I'm off line. !,5
Very good music platform... various stock...,5
Suddenly songs not playing,1
At the moment spotify is constantly glitching where i cant forward and rewind the episode im in. The episode keeps playing but there's no access to stopping playing pausing. I end up Having to turn off my phone to re boot.,3
I am satisfied with Spotify.I don't have premium so after 4 or 5 songs 29 second's ad is play.But for these ads i don't have any complain.They have amazing and perfect playlists for any mood and time.And without any premium song's audasity never been change or less.So in short I Love Spotify and my downloading data do not geting west.😋🤗😊😇,5
All in one service that allows me to access my library across devices. I love the UI as well as the easy to understand functionalities this app comes with.,5
Ads are really irritating,1
Lots of advertisements,1
"Great app, you can find eny song and good quality 👌",5
"Terrible experience onmy S10+. Keeps cutting out, and when it does play, the now playing widget is nowhere to be seen in-app Update: I upgraded to the Samsung S22+ and the issue persists. The pulldown widget stops functioning before the audio cuts out, and it just says ""Spotify is Trying to Play""",2
After years of having a free account I have decided to get a premium subscription and I will never go back. I use this app for hours each day and it works well. Only issueI have is some of my liked songs will be unliked or become duplicated in my liked songs playlist.,5
Love ❤ 😍 💖 this app follow almost anything you can think of brilliant,5
Spotify is affordable and has all the music you could want...but MY GOD IS THIS THING SLOOOOOOOOOW! The app frequently decides to close completely and getting it to start takes forever (you could literally wait a minute before it loads and allows you to play music). It boggles the mind that a company this big can get things so utterly wrong 🤔,2
"Very good experience with Spotify, I recommend to use this app, also need some minor improvements.",5
Gives me all the music I have lost and those I never thought would discover again...great App worth having it,5
"Why can't I edit my suggestion experience, I don't want to see endless lists of music playlists.",1
Lot's of songs in this application i m really impressed from this app🥰🥰,5
"Good music listenin', couple features I would add tho",4
Fine efficient and gets most of the music I like.,5
"So much I like but LOSING NEIL YOUNG because he simply wanted folks to get accurate COVID info is unforgivable. Ratings/$$ over people's health & safety? Shame on you Spotify! That said, Spotify's layout is easy on the eyes. The fonts, crisp album covers & how info is layed out on each page simply looks great!Adding the song lyrics? I love it. The system itself is very user friendly. The band/artist selection is HUGE, and their recs are awesome, allowing me to find new bands.!",5
This is the best app. You get all the recent songs😍,5
Best music platform by far. The suggested songs and playlist are far better than any other platform.,5
Best app... I just loved it... Giving five star....,5
Love Spotify! Being retired I love to listen to some of my favorite songs of today and years gone by. Thank you Spotify for making this available to me and others as well.,5
So easy to use and create shareable playlists.,5
Cant play my music off line and i am still paying every month,1
Love this app u find every song in this app❤️,5
I Love the songs. The app is totally good,5
Best app for music lovers...only thing that annoy is lots nd lots of ads...inorder to make us get premium...i lost my temper nd patience wen i need to listen to ads for almost 3min... premium can be opted if it's budget friendly...it's actually high rated for a common people like me..take this into consideration... horrifying ads,3
It is very nice Music app.,5
Good random music plays in the edm genre,5
"ads and limited skips are annoying. you could literally download songs from free music apps and listen to it offline, unlimited skips and choose whatever songs you want. i used Spotify for a few weeks now and i think I'll go back using Music instead of this app.",1
It's really good I didn't get any ads even that I'm on not premium.😀😀😄,5
Love this app. I'm a big fan of harry potter and unfortunately after I finish one of the books the podcast shutsdown. I don't know if it happens because I don't have the premium version. Beside that everything is good.,4
Been using Spotify for about a decade now,5
It's so cool literally any song you want too listen u can it's just like heaven,5
Not working on WiFi network.,1
Don't download this app Because u can't listen song while u were offline. I can the song that song can't played the other song plays I hate this app 🤬😡😡 Spotify my foot,1
"This last 6 months, the app has been crashing and/or freezing daily requiring a forced stop. I have tried reinstalling, bit the issue persists. Very annoying.",2
Please reduce some ads 🥴,4
It's all good until you get an ad then another then another. They are a bit annoying. I know you need them but maybe limit it to one ad and not every 5 mins please. Thank you,4
"music quality is good, but on mobile there are just too many ads to the point where it forces you to buy premium. i remember before there was only like 1 ad every 2-3 songs, but ive had instances where ive gotten 15 ads in a row after one song and then another 15 right after its not even funny. this also happens before playing any song on mobile.",2
"Spotify is GREAT, without ads so i got premium. What the sayin once you go black you never go back well it's the same for premium like you are not gonna miss them like 1 min ads like it interrupts the vibe like you all turnt and stuff and then you hear a ad talking about if you watch the ad its 30min of no ads which is misleading because it's only like four 3 to 2 min songs long which I hate I just love being able to pick which music I wanna listen to so if you get spotify I 100% rec premium",5
"Its a really good app love the play lists and their podcasts, im really into distractable great podcast 10/10",5
Great easy to use app though doesn't have every song I'm looking for but still a great everyday music app,4
Thank you Spotify....my sad/ hard times is fulfilled by with my legent Illayaraja......❤🥰,5
Everything Is Ok. Except Those Ads Even Though Premium has various perks discounts and stuff you can atleast moderate the traffic a bit. Best of luck for future <3,4
I can't hear my playlists it only chooses for me,1
Love the selection and quality of programing.,5
This is very nice and extreamly awesome app.,4
"The free experience is trash. I search any artist/song, hit play, and Spotify plays some completely unrelated song as ""suggested for you."" I skip as many times as I can (you have a number of skips per hour) and it still doesn't play the one song I want to listen to.",1
"works fine, best music app",5
I love this app but when you search your fav song and then click it. Other song will gonna play,1
No other music streaming service beats Spotify ❤,5
"If I play a week straight of jazz and techno music , my Spotify discover weekly list will still play rap/trap music... if I select a certain genre of music to be played like only jazz from my Playlist then after the 9th or 10th song it'll revert back to my original Playlist list.",3
Many problems but gave 4 stars cause i can listen to kpop songs and you recommend me good songs of my choice 1. Not proper lyrics in tamil 2. Does not have lyrics for all songs And 1 feature I like is that the app has Korean to English translation but I have seen this feature only in Alcohol free(Twice) song.... Hope that this feature will be available to all songs in future,4
"Please bring back de ""seek"" feature for music/podcast progress on status bar notification. Why remove features in first place?",4
It keep crashing and it keep turning off and saying it's hacking my stuff poor quality,1
"It's kinda dumb that we can't loop songs or choose what we play, and having a limited amount of skips is goofy ahh, please make some changes",3
"I only started using Spotify in 2020 and up until this year I loved it. The issues started with music stopping randomly is I open another app/turn my phone screen off, as well as having issues connecting it to my sonos speaker. Although those issues seemed to have been resolved, I've had enough now. Keep trying to play one playlist, but after playing one song it starts to play the last playlist I played! It's an issue on both my phone and PC.",2
Best Music streaming app i have ever experienced.,5
It's so amazing 😻 but there are so much ads 😶,3
"Later edit: Ok, this was fixed, after some updates.Please leave the + and - buttons near each other, in my list (library) for adding/removing proposed songs. Also it would be nice we could have some filters or a way to arrange the songs in the created lists",5
I can't believe I'm still paying to hear ads during podcasts and have those podcasts randomly start over when I pause it.,2
"I really get more ads compared to before, i hate it.",1
Unbelievable I'm a paid monthly customer and all it does is stop playing constantly glitching i have a strong wifi and cell signal so that is not the issue. Definitely will be canceling this garbage.,1
"I love this app, all my music in one place. I can make Playlist of my favorites and listen any time.",5
"When i reinstalled the app the karaoke feature was still there, but after a week it did not appear again. Why? As a student who makes singing as a way of releasing stress i badly need the feature.",1
Thanks for bring all good music together,5
"Please read carefully I need , that's mean not only me , some time we want to listen only lyrics not music in that song so please give option to skip music by 10 seconds or 5sec max so it's help us to take more song in minimum time Thanking you",3
Worst app . Very irritating. Ads are irritating me 🙄,1
I can't help but love Spotify,5
Very nice app to lessen songs on own choice 👍,5
"I WANT THE FAMILY PLAYLIST BACK!!! I share my premium acct wit two teenagers, how am I supposed to teach them about the back in the day music and them teach me about new music? Come on, Spotify? You can keep JR but get rid of the Family playlist. Do better.",3
I've got WiFi but it won't connect to it,5
Best streaming service out there,5
"I enjoy Spotify ,I can make a Playlist and listen to it whenever and not have to worry about songs be added to it . It's a great and easy app ! Thanks Spotify",5
🌟This app is just Perfect for music lovers 🌟,5
This is a amazing app the very best for music I have Spotify premium which makes it a much better experience too! And we have a family plan with 5 of us and we can add 1 more to 6 but we only have five family members lol I highly recommend this app must purchase and get premium,5
Some of my selections are cut short after just one or two seconds,4
"Too many ads. Just ridiculous. One ad= one song, again one ad= one song",1
"I listen to 8+ hours of music daily. I have had Napster, Pandora, and Spotify, and I am most pleased with Spotify. The breadth of available arists is impressive. Choosing favorite artists' radio stations allows me to navigate across genres and find new bands to enjoy. Downloading material for offline use is easy and it prevents burning through data on the road. Podcasts work seamlessly. If you're a music enthusiast, get off the banal radio and get a world class service like Spotify.",5
Always problems with this app,1
"Been using Spotify premium for years and generally like it, but recently it's been a bit glitchy including the app opening of its own accord and playing music (like when I'm on phone calls or using other apps), as well as songs skipping",2
I loved the was grooving and vibing but one Spotify was all ruined I couldn't play song of my choice to play the playlist I must listen to song it plays and also it would play random songs that I didn't add to my playlist turns out it was the new update please bring the old Spotify back or tell me how I could fix that's why giving it a one star otherwise 10 out of 5,1
"I'm in love with this app but I hate that I can skip only 6 songs in a hour and people put random music in playlists and thats really anoying, but after all this app is perfect",4
Good app but I hate that you can't use your account on more than one device without premium,4
Good music when I want it not very many commercials,5
"Had this app since 2016 or so and by far the worst it's ever been.. songs all got deleted, won't even show song in already made Playlist let alone play a song. Most likely will stop paying for premium",1
100% accurate services,5
Constantly need to close n restart .. errors in the que all the time. Might cnxl,1
"Very nice app ..... I just tell to everyone that the sound and song quality is very nice .. specially when you are having you headphones or earplugs .. for me .. this is a very nice app .. it is excellent , very good app for me . I advise you to download this app .. you will definitely like it",5
"I like it, but the only reason why I rated this app only 4 star is because it has too many ads, that is really intimidating.",4
I love Spotify because it's free to use. (Recommended),5
I've using Spotify for like more than a month and I will agree that it's a good and highly recommended app. Ads- totally fine and i still enjoy listening (no premium). This past week I'm having a several issue; when I play music it suddenly lags and crash out of nowhere.,4
Love that you can choose the music you want to listen too,5
Best App for Listening Mp3 Songs.,5
Too many ads before like at least a week Spotify had a lot less ads compared to now,3
Really liked the app. I mostly use it for podcasts. But lately it crashes everytime I start or resume listening to podcasts. I just updated the app and im looking forward to see if it got fix. Could also just be my old phone. I hope Spoftify eventully integrates comments on podcasts too. I think it could benefit creators as well as consumers.,3
I think it's rediculous that Spotify run ads in podcasts even for premium subscribers. I switched because of this. I hope others do to so Spotify are less inclined to do something that reminds me of bait and switch.,1
Used for around 4 years now. This app is too good.,5
When i open spotify its just stuck on the logo screen(means the screen right after opening spotify). Please fix it,1
Best app for music With the best playlists,5
Best app for music lovers but there are many errors in spelling of lyrics,1
"The app allows you to listen to music for free but there's also a cheap monthly subscription which only costs five euros here in Serbia. There's also family plans and duo plans which are for two people. Premium mode allows you to download songs for offline listening and it's great when you don't have access to internet. The free mode has its limitations, though, and you can only listen in shuffle mode. Songs also have lyrics which are synced in real-time so you can sing your favourite tunes.",5
Every update requires that I reinstall the app in order for it to work properly and it will mess up any alarms linked to the app. Stop making things that already work worse!,4
Just love it. No more painful searches,5
"Add a Feature in Downloading Music in Cellular and Not even if not Subscribe in Prenium and About that, maybe it should be more affordable in choosing of the any of it and include some feature if not online in offline.",5
"I really would love it if they fixed the issue with watching podcast on all devices, so strange that certain devices such as smart TV and ps4 and roku you can't get video only audio, so frustrating",3
"Unless connected with mobile data, it shows no connection and the wifi access to app is allowed",1
Too many ads it sucks,5
It is a amazing app for listening songs but a lot advertisements is to high in between songs,5
"When I click on a sound , another start playing",1
best app for listening music this platform is crazy spotify i wish you best for your next update,5
I have no lyrics at all songs,5
Wonderful experience i enjoy listening to the classic the app is a good one,4
I hate it everytime i click something it needs premium and the playlist im playing after the one song ended theres this random song thats gonna play even its not in my playlist.,1
Totally has changed the music accesories ❤️,1
This is the best app to listen musin,5
"Hi. Just wanted to say I love the app. But, today I got a new device and tried to transfer everything. When it came to my spotify I can't get my paid membership. Wha can I do about this? Thanks",4
Spotify premium is the best I have used this service for years with no problems I recommend it to everyone who enjoys listening to what they like,5
"spotify is a great listening app. the only problem is that for you to have the best experience is you have to buy premium. though i dont have any problem with buying something but for some, they do. ive also been having problems updating my app. ive been having troubles updating my spotify since 2020. please do fix this 🥲",4
"The app is good,but without premium is just mid. You can't listen to songs and you have to look at ads in every 30 minutes. But if you buy premium is actually good ig",5
I like that it knows the type of music I like and offer good suggestions on discovering new music,5
Why my Spotify keeps on cutting out everytime why,1
"Great App, but sometimes it lags.",4
"Good marketing strategy on ads which intentionally leads to use or listen to this app 30 mins. The next 30 mins. After an update or long break for usage i am unabke to open the existing account this is my 3rd account.☹️👎But still i am using this app because UI is good, otherwise i would change..",1
"I used to love this app,but then it filled with ads,like totally.I mean even if we say we don't want premium too they still urge us to buy it.",1
"It's not working, the app can't open!!",1
The music quality is better than any music app out there overall very good experience with Spotify! :),5
"Don't download guys , this is not music app , it's advertisement app.",1
"It used to be good then they did this stupid update,like seriously 6 skips per hour and you can't skip forward in songs anymore.",1
I like your app so much but I don't like the music tab that you can't close in the home Manu that is the only thing I don't like please I would like you to change that. Thanks for your time,4
Keeps taking my money and not giving the upgraded features!! No way to speak the customer service.,1
"I thought at first Wow what an amazing app so much better than YT music. But oh wait this morning I went into the app and it said ""your 14 day free trail has stopped"" WHAT I DONT EVEN HAVE PREMUIM! Now it has ditched all its good functions - example - ONLY 6 skips per hour, Can only play specific songs. The dumbest app ever. I'd rather pay for YT premium Than use this. 0 STARS IF I COULD RATE IT.",1
This is best app for music friends AAP isme apni plalist bena sekte hai or yeh playlist ke tipe ke songs aapko suggest kerega thank you for your app,5
"I love spotify. I listen in my car, at home and on my phone. They have all my favorite songs and their song suggestions are right on point.",5
I enjoy listening to music and walking,5
"Love this app!...great music, great selection, awesome!",5
Can't open Spotify app right now.,2
Easy-to-use and huge selection,5
"Stable and easy to use with a vast library of music across multiple genres as well as many of the more popular podcasts. A very useful feature is the ability to toggle between 3 levels of quality which directly impacts the storage space used for downloads. Overall, I am pleased so far with the value I am getting.",5
It's a awesome music app I am using it for 3years,5
It is great when we use this app it has so many songs old and new also so many rap songs it is more diffrent than the other ones i really apreciate👍👍👍,5
"there's this issue that i can't even play or use my spotify, I don't know why but I already updated the app and still unable to play music.....",1
There is a problem there. We can't download songs😒,3
"Yeh the update is trash. Why would i listen to random songs if i was picking a song in my playlist? I pick a specific song in my playlist, pressed play, and a random song started playing. Which is a ""suggested"" Song. Bro just let me play my music. Just add the ""suggested song"" somewhere else than making someone angry. Just nah.",3
Spotify runs ads on premium and if you cancel your premium while you have time left on premium spotify will overwhelm you with ads about staying premium. It also crashes constantly and reset your listen time on podcasts regularly,1
I enjoy all the music and play time never have a problem!,5
"I am in a nursing home and cant get around, and i absolutely love music and wow i play it most of the day. Also other residents ask me if i can turn up the volume lol, and i do.",5
"Great, love it, has majority of things I'd like to listen to.",5
Best music streaming app period!,5
"I love Spotify. My only complaint is the requesting of songs or not uploading whole albums. Spotify if you're reading this pls upload ""So Nice"" by Leroy Hudson. Thx",4
It's giving ad after every song and it's getting v annoying,1
I like it but.. Everytime i wanna play a song it always plays another song the ones im not looking for..and it stops when i exit and turn off my phone it doesnt still play music in the notif and its great because you dont need to download loads of musics and storage piling up good job 😉👍,4
A very good music app i recommendit t everyone,5
Very good app it must included more features but i didn't find all lofi songs i rate 5 because i love it veryyy lovely app,5
Brilliant I can find the music that I like 👍,5
All your listening needs are handy right at your fingertips.,5
"Some issues with VPN. Be careful connecting to countries like Russia, it will delete every download you have, even on PC. So just tunnel it before you male the same mistake. Took a while to realize as well ><",4
"Thank you, Spotify",4
I love Spotify!!!!! Still loving it!!!🎶,5
If u dont buy premium They will put up so many ads thst you will be forced to buy premium Basically either u uninstall or buy premium,1
"Great audio , searching for for the music",5
"What happen? Log out and now cannot even login, network problem it says, and give me link to login also expired. Hope can repair this bug as I had subscribed duo package every month",1
Best music you guys love it thank you,4
"How do you get the bloody thing to stop automatically playing when my car connects to Bluetooth!!??? My God it's such a pain!!! Close the app? Nope doesn't work. Search in vain for a stop or exit button? Nope. Cant find anything. Uninstall app until you want to use it again, then reinstall? Yep. Only thing I've found that works. Now also adding the frustration of no way to rewind a podcast if you miss a few minutes and want to go back and hear it again. Have now uninstalled for good.",2
Ads is over inthe app stop first ads just a music player no ads player okey,1
"the non-premium experience is horrible to the point of that it should not even exist. If you dont want to spend money on listening to music then literally use any other platform and steer clear from this. You should not support this business practice. If you dont enjoy using the service please uninstall the app, it really goes a long way to hurt the company",2
"Unfortunately mobile app doesn't work for me at all. Can't find music to play, all playlists are empty and even suggested songs from Home do not play. I have a Premium account and all. Works great on PC though.",1
Too many ads,5
"Spotify give me Always Running from Teyarch and Malukah and I will pay you money. This is an outrage. Also, I still can't filter different albums/artists. Double outrage",2
The app is good but tends to get annoying when it plays the opposite song that i asked for .,2
Only ads noting else 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻,1
Music 🎶 is very good and thanks to all,5
"Too much ads,",1
A good app to stream music from,5
Smart music app Excellent,5
The app DOESN'T even play the songs downloaded!? Why do I pay for this if it won't let me listen to the songs I DOWNLOADED!,1
I cant log in even with the correct pass and email it shows network error try again later happened everytime i switch device which made me end up making new accounts and have to do this time too my all songs are gone overall the app is really good,3
Rubbish update app its messed up at songs on my play list no longer the same as I has. It won't play anything I click on anymore it plays what it likes even if when using a play list.,1
"Nice music,clear recording good sounds to hear",5

"I really like Spotify, I have a problem why do you guys only allow tablets to have no ads even if they don't have Spotify premium?",5
this app is so nice i can now listen to my favorite songs and i always update for their songs of every local and international artist so thats why i give this 5 stars💙💜🥰,5
They have all my favorite music and some interesting podcasts. The sounded is great and even though I don't have premium the ads are not long.,5
One of the best applications for songs,5
"I swear its too restricting, spotify was a lot better before the update.",1
Non stop problems with app crashing or it just starts skipping songs and podcasts. Also after you listen to the ads it will glitch and start the ads over again several times. If it wasn't for Joe rogans podcast I would have given up on this app a long time ago,1
The algorithm us just perfect. Im addicted to it.,5
Everything in this app is okay but ads are the major issues .. I m not saying to close it but decrease the timings ......,5
"Great price to have access to a lot of different media with good audio quality. My dislikes are that the app itself sometimes takes a while to run , even while you have premium the app while go haywire and sometimes won't let you listen to downloaded music offline All of this is fixible if you know how but what makes me upset is how much effort it sometimes takes to get listening parties to start working , it'd be easier to break into my neighbors house.",3
"Its better than wynk or gaana , it has the best playlist",5
Idea- your organization should make where it only shows ads after you run put of skips.,3
I like the app very much... Good for listening songs &have a good quality of sound 👌👌,5
"Showing offline while using spotify in wifi. My wifi is not the problem. This issue occurs when i try to play music from a downloaded playlist. Spotify comes back online when i switch to mobile data and goes back online when connected to wifi. But the funny part is that i can listen to songs from my saved playlists even though it's shown offline. Upon checking online, many people are reporting this issue for Spotify. Please rectify this ASAP.",2
It's a good app. But I couldn't download my playlists despite that I paid for the premium version. Still don't know why.,4
Its really good for listening music,4
"Poor performance app does the hell what it likes, constantly reinstalling the frigging thing.put a question to Spotify never get a answer back, just keep taking the money guys but,spend some on development aye.",1
"I can't buy premium mini, it always appears unable to connect, even though the signal is good.",2
Keep getting random songs that are not even in my liked playlist is so annoying,3
I used to have the problem with having to wait for the skips and not being able to skip to my favorite songs so if yall don't want that problem just get the account modded version,2
I like IT and the bass is so powerful,5
Always Advertisements i will install this app,1
"I like that most of the songs are here and playlists are so fun to make, i don't have any problems on it in web chrome computer...!! But...spotify app on phone...T___T I can't play my playlist start to bottom, the only option is shuffle!? :< It is so unecessary!! I can't even view my friend's playlist description fully :;(∩´﹏`∩);: Please don't make shuffle the only way to play the playlist please!! Oh and also, why do I need to be in college to get premium!? TOT",2
"Easy to navigate, lyrics are available...",5
It has a lot of song but sometimes it glitches out,4
Screw your premium I just want to listen to music,1
"The only thing good about the Spotify app is that it plays music in sleep mode and out of the tab, but it throws random songs at me that I didn't want to listen to on my liked songs",1
Love it! Awesome features and nice to use for music in my car,5
Ukkkkkkmmmkkkkkkkk to get to get to get a good idea of a sudden change 3D hardware and to have you heard about it in my interest to have the time and I have you ever been a while to respond with a sudden and to respond as promptly and I have you heard about it but it's also possible and if there was no answer to respond with to have you ever get the best way is Essex junction box office to have the best regards John to respond as promptly to get a yn se udghoshak ge keep particular punctual uöò,5
If you buy premium you will recieve no add but if you use it for free there are songs between the advertisement 😂,1
The best app ever in music the sound quality of music is just amazing literally don't have words to explain ply try this once a moment only have one problem that's the amount of subscription for premium is high so please...... by the way left all the things are best....,5
Spotify as we all know was great. WAS up until this new update I can't pick songs and I thought picking a Playlist would work but nope songs I didn't even add are on it. I didn't even know this update was a thing up until I got a new phone cause on my tablet and laptop I don't have to worry about this. Literally the only reason people use Spotify is to avoid this. If we wanted to not know our next song we'd use Pandora,2
Very nice music app like it,5
It's a fine app. One complaint is I can't put a sleep timer on during an ad.,2
Great app for music!,4
Easy access to found favorite music,5
PLEASE ADD: option to add whole playlists to Queue after 4yrs this is the only annoying thing!! *** If paying subscription fee of it is 100% advert free (adverts drive me insane!!!)& you can play your music in the order you like. You can also put your songs into a queue which is easiest to do when you want to listen to a whole album as you just click on album cover & then click add to queue however it is way more time consuming if you want to listen only to particular songs and / or playlists.,3
This is good AP I have ever use but their are some gilch so Spotify have to fix it,4
Great...many thanks that I can listen here to the best classical music!,5
"Same problem as everyone else using the free version, they've updated Spotify to force people to pay up or go home.",1
Its a shame how many bugs Android users are facing - there's nothing more annoying than having to reset the app everytime the playing bar disappear or when it just pause randomly. The worst thing is that I even pay for this...,1
IM TRYING TO MAKE MY OWN PLAYLIST BUT SPOTIFY KEEPS PUTTING SOME SONGS IN MY PLAYLIST I KEEP TRYING TO MAKE A NEW PLAYLIST BUT ITS NOT WORKING I JUST WANNA MAKE MY OWN PLAYLIST PLEASE FIX THIS IF YOU DONT FIX IT IM FINNA DELETE THE APP,1
5 ads before I can listen to one song,2
"Great music quality, very polished and smooth app and is easy on the eyes! ALSO MAKE PODCASTS LIKE ABLE AND REPEATABLE!!! Other than that premium is very recommended if you can afford it.",5
"Great for the first two songs but then a random song pops out from no where the song also is not on my play list. Please get rid of this Spotify. The song was called me and yo mama, that's the name this song came out of no where. then ten minutes later i have yet i listen to my play list. Then thirty minutes later i get one song one my play list but after just more random songs. Please Spotify Please remove this.",2
What is with this update- I also suffered the same thing everyone went through here. What-,2
App just doesn't do anything. Recently swapped from Amazon music due to the poor quality of the app and so far I am very disappointed in Spotify as the app doesn't function in any way and is far worse than Amazon. The App needs fixing!,1
Needs more skips for finding your music 6 skips r not another,5
Love using Spotify.,5
Wide genre of music at your fingertips. Excellent quality!!!!All the time,5
A good way to find music and podcasts,5
"Excellent app , I'm using this app very long time but the major problem is going for a long this app is getting too slow day by day",2
I never wanted it but I tried it ons last time and I got to say this App is worth it boys🔥💯❤️😂,5
"If Spotify premium is free on PlayStation and TV, it should be free on Amazon Alexa too...",3
"This app is just amazing We can listen all types of songs there And also of our fav artist like BTS,Neha kakkar,arjit singh,blackpink etc I love this app very much purple you 💜",5
One of the worst app i have ever used. Even though I had a a wifi with good internet speed but my songs just buffer and buffer. My eqilizer is turning off the second I leave the app. It's getting worse day by day and the amount of adds they had put between the songs are overkill. After every 1or2 song's there is an add. Deleting this app.,1
I love Spotify it's my life I wish I had premium though it would be soooo much better but I'm broke lmao 😭,5
When i Click an song it shows different song its annoying I hate it Worst app i have installed tbh,1
"Inspite of using the premium version, you can't see all the song in one simple list when you type the name of the artist. It's so inconvenient to look for songs album by album. Horrible UX",2
Great Music Service App.,5
They solved my problem after mentioning here thankyou Spotify,5
This app isfree music videos fancing too much latest songs this app has ads problem this app very easy to use,5
"3 songs 12 adds, I understand theirs premium but thats a bit much for free users. A Song is around 3-5 minutes each, 12 adds is 6 Minutes, I had 2 Songs worth of adds. And how often is the 30mins of no adds as I would think after 12 adds Ishould get that.",1
I liked it when I first download it I could fast forward or go back in the song and when I looked at the song I could play that song now I can't even get the song that I want when I click on it I get a whole different song and there's ads now and I can't even fast order or go back and when the songs over I can't even go back to the song,1
"PLEASE let me, a paying subscriber, remove the constant suggestions for podcasts. I must have accidentally started playing a podcast and now all I get is relentless push notifications whenever that podcast and similar ones I have equally no interest in have new episodes come out. Please let us, the user, have more control over what is forced down our throats.",1
"The app is borderline useless, won't continue reliably playing music with the screen shut off. My podcast wont download. When they do play (particularly The JRE), they randomly skip to an old episode, and lists the one I was listening to as fully played, so I loose where I was in a 3hr podcast. These issues prompted me to end my premium account subscription. Very poor performance, and no options for support. Personally I am incredibly disappointed in the Spotify app. Full stop.",1
Its been pretty easy to use but there are some songs that are not on spotify that i want to listen to,4
It's a great platform for streaming your favourite,4
"I'm now having issues with every song I play pausing in the middle of the song, it happens a few times per song too. Very annoying when your trying to exercise to music! What's going on Spotify? I don't pay for no ads to have the music pause for a few secs each time. Might be time to find a new music app.",1
"Continues advertisements comes in the middle of song, not even able to listen one song property, whenever I wanted to change the song there will be advertisement plays. I know I have to get premium for avoiding ad but it's very useless without premium",1
"I can't even choose the songs I want to be played,And there's an unbelievable amounts of ads. First two weeks were amazing,and with the free subscription it was plain horrible. It's all a cash grab after a while.",1
Has everything perfectly at the tip of your fingers. Why go elsewhere,4
"This app just to be fine With the latest update I keep getting disconnected no matter how close I am to my modem or how many signal bars I have, interrupting my songs 2 to 4 times per song. I can't even see what I am playing on the notification bar on android and I have not figured out how to see what I am playing in the app. This app just to be so intuitive and easy to use and now it's riddled with issues.",3
"Amazing app, best best Im fed up with jio savan , there is lots of add... I like it very much Spotify Love love love",5
Son unfortunately is unable to afford the price so I have offered to pay half. And the changes spotify added make getting to my Playlist difficult... I prefer the original easier to maneuver site... Plus with my limited income makes it difficult to afford on SSI,2
"It's good for playing music, but when tracking pocast episode it's a nightmare. You have to scroll down so far if you accidentally add a unplayed episode to the played one. The filters doesn't really help in navigating. I think it could be better",2
Great experience with the app every music and artist is available for your liking,5
It has too many addsಠಗಠ,1
YAYYY IM SO GLAD THEY ADDED BACK THE FEATURE I REALLY LOVE SPOTIFY EVEN IF IT HAS ADS,5
WHY CAN'T YOU HAVE A PLAN WHERE I COMPLETELY PAY FOR EVERYTHING ON SPOTIFY INSTEAD OF PAYING IT MONLTHLY WHAT IF I FORGET TO PAY IT!😤,1
This app was not doing what it supposed to do it's not playing songs.Some songs are not being played,1
"Love the app, works great, never had any problems 👍",5
This app has become really really bad. Keeps saying I have no internet connections which I do. Sound does not sound good on certain albums. Takes ages and ages to open an album or track and when playing an app it just stops playing altogether This needs to be fixed ASAP!!!!!!!! Definitely not happy at all 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔. Not good enough seeing how I am paying for this app.,2
Still a great way to listen to great music👍💕💥,5
𝑳𝒐𝒗𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒂𝒑𝒑!!! 𝑰 𝒖𝒔𝒆 𝒊𝒕 𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒊𝒕𝒔 𝒂 𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚 𝒈𝒐𝒐𝒅 𝒂𝒑𝒑. 𝑰 𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒅 𝒊𝒕 𝒕𝒐 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚𝒐𝒏𝒆. ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ,5
Its work great. I highly recommend spotify adding back the option to listen to sample of song so members can get song they like.,2
It is really best app for music 🎶 👍🏻,5
2 adds in a row and premium is really expensive,3
"+he Volume Level feature isn't working, was working before +he last 2 updates!",1
Can't remove any songs from recently played...but still the best,4
brilliant app.long awaited in India. gives me the kind of music i like. Song radio feature is outstanding.,5
Very good podcasts.,5
"Best music app, just one suggestion though... You should add feature in playlist where user should be able to rank order songs.",5
Amazing experience but would like to increase the 30 minute advertisement ski0 time.,5
It's a good app don't get me wrong.but the thing is I try to pay and it doesn't accept.also every other song (without premium) there is an ad.and also only 6skips per hour??that's insane.also it add random songs to the playlist.these issues can all be fixed but for now y'all have lost a installerrrrr ig but anyway I will not be using this app anymore till these simple things are fixed.ihave been using Spotify for years now this has always been a problem.SPOTIFY FIX THE PATMENTS!THE AMOUNT OF ADS,1
It always says I'm offline even on a super fast network & search doesn't work. It makes the app useless. This started in the recent builds from last 10 days or so Apart from that Amazing app. You have the fastest streaming service I have used really amazing. These feature requests look to be done 1.Reduce the amount of space it uses in my disk. 2.Genre playlist which plays songs in all languages in that genre Thanks for that.,1
For a subscription service. Why am I listening to commercials in podcasts?,3
"I liked the app until the newest version. The older version in my opinion better. 6 skips an hour really? The songs that get added to the Playlists are the most annoying, they never end. Before i would rate Spotify 5 stars but this, it's not something i have seen anywhere.(sorry for wasting your time if you are a normal person but if you help Spotify tell them to fix this. Im not the only one here that wants this fixed too.)",2
Can download songs for offline playing,5
I love this app but I wish some artists were available to stream such as Atheist. As a big metal fan and music fan finding out some songs and artists aren't available to stream sucks. Please Please please allow these to be available,4
Best music streaming platform.🥰💐🤗,5
It's amazing app to song platform,5
"Look, the apps functionality is great, I cannot think of a better music app, but the optimisation is very poor, whenever I open a playlist, the thumbnail won't load most of the times, if I play a song the thumbnail on the minimized player too won't show, most of the times!!!! I guess this ruins the experience of just using the app, so please fix this as soon as possible.",3
"Wow, love story's FABULOUS. Thank you looking forward other story's.",5
Love thiscapp great music and podcast selections,5
"I'm not sure what the recent update has done but it now stops randomly, which, is super convenient for me, but dangerous if other people are experiencing this on the road and attempting to reopen. I appreciated some features of the new update but it seems to have wrecked the app - this is faster than providing feedback to customer service. It's June 26, now. Y'all aiight? Blink twice if you need help.",1
My app is installed and now it's saying no internet connection...... What's the matter?,1
Best musical app ever... You can listen your favourite music while your phone is on a sleeping mood... No ad no loading just mind blowing 5 of 5👌👌👌👌,5
Best music streaming app hands down 🤞👌,5
Login troubleshooting has some unnecessary redundancies.,3
"You can turn the screen off and still have content play, unlike a certain other popular streaming app :D",5
Good app. But should enable download,3
All I do is listen to music all this app is the best,5
This app is completley STUPID i try to play mc mental but it just turn into another song I NEED TO SPEAK TO THE COE THAT MADE THIS STUPID APP,1
Great music without any interference,5
My on the road go to for jams!! Luvn sooo many Playlist!!,5
Spotify is awesome !!!,5
When will you allow us to edit our recently played? Why are songs being removed from the Liked playlist if they're hidden on Repeat?,3
"If i could give zero stars i would This app is a piece of garbage ware on Android extremely poorly optimized constantly deleting my downloads and slower then molasses, its not because i have an older phone because well i don't i have an lg g7 thinq and when i first downloaded this hot garbage of a music app and payed premium in 2018 it was still bad and they have had almost 3 years to fix it and they haven't -10/10 Update I got the new google pixel 6, love the phone, Spotify still runs like s***",1
"I absolutely adore this app. I've been using Spotify for roughly four years now, and I've had minimal problems with the app. I believe that using it on a phone is the best experience, but I've relied on the web player and honestly have only had a few problems. After inspecting their website for answers, I resolved the issues by running diagnostics and such, and never really had problems again. I very much so recommend this app, especially when you use their premium subscription.",5
I love Spotify so much I would have gave it a five but you already know its the adds but i really dont mind then because i have remebers them all word by word but on my liked songs random songs that are on my dont like pop up,4
Hate the ads,5
"a pretty good app, and theres a fair amount of adds without premium.",5
"One star review because I can't play my favorite music without having some difficulties like let's say I would love to play ""build our machine"" by dagames but when I do, it just brings me to a useless album that doesn't even play the music I want to listen to and when I add music to my favorites playlist, it doesnt even play the whole song only a short 5 second clip of that song but when I play other music, it works like what and the shuffling oh my god who the hell cares about it? Just fix it.",1
So many ads so I give only three Stars,3
The only bad part is the ads,4
Variety and awesome music,5
It's a great app to for music and podcasts. There are a lot of ads but they aren't after every song.,4
Works flawlessly. Can find anything imaginable for songs including foriegn music.,5
The widget doesn't work anymore and I always use it! Please try to fix it :(,2
Incomplete list of album of some artist especially Local artists.,4
"Having been on spotify for as long as it's been available in my country, I find its current state discouraging. Premium plans are very expensive when you're likely also using up your mobile data (yes, download is a thing - but what of music recommendations? what of phone storage?), but the ads on the free plan are unbearable. In the past, you would get a 30s ad for 30m of music. Now, you get five 20s ads, two songs, rinse, repeat. It's ridiculous. Unusable if not for bandom/k-pop goal purposes.",1
Very poor experience and every second is advisement very very bad application very wrost,1
"The best current music experience, across all platforms. I have only had a positive experience with the app, and it seems to always be improving.",5
Have used Spotify for over 15 years now. Would never stop,5
"I'm having so many problems with my Spotify, it's driving me nuts. I've spent way too much time troubleshooting and it still jumps to the next song randomly, stops after a few seconds of playing when it's through my Google Home or Android Auto, tells me it's offline when it's not...I'm close to abandoning it altogether.",2
I like the app and the music but I don't like how we can't do almost anything with out premium. Like I cant repeat songs and other kind of random songs pop in when I'm listening to my playlist.,3
App keeps self fast forwarding podcast. App turns my volume down every 15 min. 3 android devices has the same issue. Recent updates did not fix it.,1
Too many damn ads and useless garbage!,3
Seems to only play 30 second clips. Uninstalled,1
Bad app absolutely terrible the app adds STUPID songs to your playlist for NO reason,1
I give up on watching news during the day. I get up in the morning get a cup of coffee go outside in the yard before it gets too hot turn on Spotify and just crank it for about 4 hours a beautiful way to start the day.,5
"I use Free. I don't mind the ads, though they seem to have doubled recently so now sometimes it's 4 consecutive ads every 2-6 songs. I DON'T MIND ADS. So why can't I play an album without it shutting down for no reason; won't even allow you to play any album more than a couple of times? I'm willing to suffer ads and recommended songs but you deny me my album anyways? Remind me: what's the point? Otherwise a good app just not inclined to pay when I'm being shorted up front.",2
I love this app as it has all my fav songs,5
"Enjoy Spotify, easy to use and find songs",5
App keeps opening when I restart my phone. Not cool. No setting seems to address this issue and there was nothing in the support section. I don't care enough to log in and email for help so Uninstalling is all I am left with. Oh well.,1
"It asks me if i want to watch a short add for 30min of ""un interutpped"" listening i watch the add and 2 songs later i get another add.",1
Best podcast app out there,5
"I'm very dissatisfied with this most recent update, no currently playing bar, doesn't even turn my playing song green, very inconvenient.",4
"The app doesn't seem to be able to play on any Sonos devices, either mine or those of other people that I used to be able to???! It's there a known problem?",1
I can find any song and love premium no ads rewind and fast fwd u can't beat itI,5
It always log out when my data depletes and always requires me to download the playlists i have already downloaded all over again. I'm done with this app!!,1
"Single handedly killing the music industry and yet I give it $11.99 a month. If you want to get depressed, search for 'love' and see 'all songs' .... You've never heard of any of these artists and you will never have the time of day to listen to all this music. I wish curating my playlist was easier: it's hard without the pictures. The web app is so slow. But I can only change the playlist display pic on the web app. Wish I could do that on mobile. Pay your artists, Spotify. You can afford it!",4
Always on point and convenient as a premium member I don't use anything else but Spotify,5
I love Spotify its just the ads are anyyoing. Also I love how u can find songs from tiktok on here and sped up songs,4
Well its good but so far I had trouble with. Its doesnt want to open the albums I created on my library,5
to be honest this app is very useful for gamers for many reasons but i only hate in this app is the ads about spotify premium and im teenager i dont have credit card to buy the premuim account so please dont make us watch ads.,3
love this app. <3 but sadly in andriod you cant pick the songs you wanna play but in iphone or ipad you cant :'),5
The best way to listen to music,5
"Really well thought out design, only problem I get is not being able to pick a song every so often otherwise, works fabulously!",5
It's great clear music so far no ads,5
Just a great music platform. Easy to use with an enormous collection of music and more.,5
There is a wide selection of music but there is an add every 2 songs,3
"Before when I wpuld create a playlist spotify would have 'recommended' songs that I had the option to add to the playlist. Now they automatically add them songs and no matter how many times I delete those songs, they just keep adding new ones. I used to like using spotify but now its just a pain in the a$$ with this new update. If I wanted those songs in my olaylist I would've added them myself.",2
I love how accurate the recomemended songs are and they turn out to be songs I never knew I liked. I highly recomend.,5
Everything I need in a music app,5
"Doesn't work with Android OS 11, has 'something went wrong, try again'. Nothing plays and is now unusable. Please fix.",1
Such a interesting experience in music.,5
After update. Unable to control with my sport gear 3 watch. Would give negative stars if possible. It is really that bad!!!,1
Missing play controls still... Is this a software/app or other problem...?,3
"Great, enjoying the audio books, great podcasts",5
They fixed all the issues I had previously now it's in a very good state,5
I just love the functions that r installed in it like if I can't remember the song name then I can write the singer or artist name and then all of his/her songs appears and it is ads free and free playlists and just one click to add in playlist not like SoundCloud where we have to listen the whole song first...but anyways I just love the app you should try this if u have interest in music 🎶 or any thing realate to music...thank you ✨💜👍💫🔗,5
"I literally can't get rid of my subscription, it's forcing money out of my account that I can't afford. How do I get rid of premium?!?!?",2
"Today I had to listen to 3 long ads (over a minute) every two songs for an entirety of a drive. How desperate and greedy can a corporation get. Oh well, back to mp3s we go!",1
Easy to play music,5
"Andriod App is constantly bugging out and crashing. Stops playing randomly. Been having issues for months, nothing's been done about it. Requires a few restarts of app to work.",1
Love the ability to find obscure things that I can't find anywhere else.,5
"I absolutely hate this app. The adds very very irritating. I know you are trying to force people to buy sprtify premium but enough is enough. Adds come almost after every 2 song. And not just one add, it's 2 adds. This is horrible. Trying to force customers into buying premium by irritating them while they listen to music. This app sucks 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼",1
"Spotify has helped me uncover the sounds that I hear echoing on the top of my mind.. and it has helped me discover new sounds, adding to that echoing sound of my mind..✨👌🏽",4
Pleasure to listen too. Nice music 🎶,4
Endless Pleasure for the music lover in u ! I wish I could skip more than 6 songs sometimes you just want to hear only your favs why the need for control 😟,4
Very excited about music choices,5
Love spotify ♥. The family plan is affordable and the sound quality is always booming on my speakers. Everyone can hear when I'm coming down the road! I will never leave them.,5
"As of late when I play music or a podcast there is no interface for what is playing. This leads to the fact that there is no way to pause or skip. So if I want to pause, I actually need to close the app now. Hopefully this gets fixed.",2
"Great app! Has the sickest jamz & tunez. Brings me to a better mood with my energy booster playlist ND then brings me down, when I'm in my feelings",5
"So great. Subscribed now. Best thing. Listening own playlist while reading, gaming, dancing, dating. The best. Up to date podcasts, music, Sigrid, Devon Cole, etc. Couldnt ask for more. I'm in.",5
Brilliant app. 👏 Lately the mobile app has been bugy (getting mixed on device sync). Would be great if could add lyrics to songs in your playlists (i.e. songs in less popular languages has too less lyrics). It would be great if you could share a song to your follower(s) within the app. Thanks,4
I love the app as much as spotiq,5
It puts songs that I don't have on my play list,1
"Love Spotify,has all my favorite music at the tap of my finger tips.👍",5
Thanks for free books and music...😍😍😍,5
Love the West Wing podcast it has sprawling depth.,5
Not excessive advertising,5
Please reduce showing ads,3
This app it's awesome and it amp it you up.,5
"Some kinda bug on it. It keeps randomly connecting to my echo dot which isnt even plugged in. It plays 10 seconds of a song through my phone then goes silent, spotify picks a random song... skips half way though then says its connected to my dot 🤦‍♀️",2
"This is a good app and all but my complaint isn’t really much. Every time I try to play Spotify songs and play something, the music just stops for some reason. It happens a lot and while games lag too. Other than that, this is a good music app.",5
"very nice app, however I don't know if it's just my phone but it will randomly stop playing music and pretty much refresh the app if I'm on a different app/game with spotify music playing which is really annoying and leaves me to have to go continuously back and forth from app to app to get the music to continue playing.",4
I have had this app since 2012. In the last week it no longer will download songs and play them offline. It's weird. I will be canceling all 4 of my accounts. I prefer YouTube music instead. I problem cleared up. I bought a kenwood stereo that has spotify on but will not properly connect not matter what I do. Apparently no one can. Wasted opportunity on kenwood and Spotify. Seems like everything is half-assed now,3
I don't listen to music everyday so i can't nitpick tecnical thing about this app m here only to rant about their irritating technique to force us to take the prime membership.....i mean come on man is it mandatory?obvsly no everyone know this .......then why make it sooo annoying by putting an ad after every single song......atleast give us 30min nonstop song as it was before that would be enough for us.... M not stopping u from doing ur advertisement but have lil bit of pity on us......,1
I enjoy that the ads aren't very long,4
Very good and nice app for music,5
It so nice to listen to your own favorite songs and lyrics too😊,5
"Has all good songs but it always gives me ""suggested songs"" its really annoying and i always hate all the songs they suggest",3
Great music application,5
I listen to Spotify every day. Podcast mostly. I love that I can always find new stories. Very interesting. Keeps me coming back daily for more.,5
Overall great experience but to many ads if you don't want to pay for premium.,5
I can appreciate the ability to set up a bundle of music you can enjoy for hours.,4
I've always loved this app but for the past couple of days it's been giving me issues it shows I have liked songs but when I click on the liked songs folder it says no liked songs I tried logging out and logging back in but that didn't work all I wanted to do was make a Playlist,3
"Grate service, still can't get sertin songs same as apple",4
Pay to win app basically. I can't play ONE song. Like it only shows a 5 seconds preview of how it sounds. I can't even listen to any songs on my playlists. There is no point it's a PAY TO WIN APP,1
I have spotify premium and failed to pay my subscription on time. I was given a few days to update my payment details before my premium expired and hence didnt lose my downloads. Thanks a lot for this!,5
It's free therapy 🤷‍♂️ besides the ads- 🗿,4
"I have the paid version of Spotify, and along with the YouTube-Pro app it's become one of my most used apps! For anyone still buying albums/singles on CD, give Spotify a try and you'll soon realise this is the way forward in 2022. If the ads annoy you, get the ""pro"" version, it's worth EVERY penny. For the cost of a SINGLE ALBUM each month, instead of just one album you get almost EVERY album ever made! Seriously, give the paid version a try! Without ads it's so much better! 10/10",5
Wish it would play on my watch when my phone isn't on,3
"The Equalizer can't be controlled but in iOS, equilizer can be controlled. Without equilizer the music experience is ruined",2
The best music app ever,5
"I want to love this, I do, and on my phone it works great, on my laptop it keeps logging me out",2
"Less data , more songs..",5
"My only place for music, podcasts, audiobooks.",5
Very quick and easy. Love it!,5
"Absolutely love Spotify. The best 10 dollars a month I've spent. Everything has a choice here. Hi-fi or low-fi music. I have Bose cube speakers and using Bluetooth with an app for bass boost and equalizer the music is intoxicating. I have 100 Playlist and EVERY CD ever made is accessible here. Journey, Def Lepard, Van Halen, Winery Dogs, Alter Bridge, Slash, Seal, etc. Sounds amazing in hi-fi. MUST use an app for equalizer and bass boost. Thans Spotify. I never have to buy any cd",5
"I really did like this app, but then they added a preview update now its really hard to play a certain song, they also add random songs to your Playlist and it's really annoying so yeah.",2
"No one comes close. I live on Spotify and if you don't use it you are missing out on a must have subscription. Spotify is like the Amazon of streaming music, podcasts, concert hub, artist info and merchandise links I can go on for ever!",5
Very nice app for personalized music. All things are sorted. I love Spotify🥰❤️,5
"Has a vast array of Artists, albums and songs, many have the lyrics provided, many also have information on the artist's and their history. User friendly app.",5
"Great app, but I should be able to skip as many times as I want and play whatever I want without have to pay for premium.",3
I feel like their should not ever be suggested songs it is so annoying and wastes your skips 🙄 fix it and my rating will go to 5,2
Why do people always act this is a good app when it clearly is a scamming app used to scam people into buying premium so that the app would work but when people buy premium nothing changes and the user gets very annoyed and writes a complaint only for it to get removed so it can have a good rating and scam more people.,1
It gives me peace of mind.i play whatever music which comes on my mind,5
Really enjoying the app so many albums I haven't heard in years,4
Older version was better. Used to be able to access playlists from home screen. Now I have to search through the app to find what I want to listen to.,2
"From a free perspective the app kinda suck with all the ads and having to have internet. A premium perspective is very different, but you still need internet dispite saying you dont. I live in the middle of a wooded area so it's hard to get good service without paying an excessive amount.",4
Love Spotify!!! Everyday I'm listening to my favorite jams!!! Thanks for the enjoyment from your service...,5
"Ok i don't have premium subscription but what does it mean..? It's almost after every single song, i have to suffer with add.. Too irritating and tired of this now..",2
"Unable to login and there is no option of retrieving password, while using the option of login without password many times showing ""error logging in. Try later""",2
"I love listening song,s on this app but one problem it have much adds but this is the best app and this is much better than gaana",5
"You just deserve that😁 I wish they added those 🌟. Like 10 🌟, you just have to earn it. All what I wanted to listen in 1 place 😍 🎶",5
Something went wrong Give another go Fix that. I cant use my 1 week premium.,1
it's so endearing without ads🥲😌,5
The free version is great. Just make alot of playlists with a couple songs on it... (Will let you choose which songs you want to hear!) The ads are a little irritating though especially if you're trying to sleep.The paid subscription is very nice and will allow you to listen to most songs (all in the order you want) the only thing that would make it five star is a couple artist's albums aren't on it. Overall amazing.,4
"The music plays instantly with lyrics as well, that's super cool",5
great a+ best free music even better when you hop on a afamily plan 3 Gold Stars,5
"As a person with adhd, I cannot STAND having my playlists on shuffle. Please work on this issue 🥺",4
Great new music weekly. And if you download the music you can listen still offline,5
Sometimes buggy when the playback suddenly stops and seems like the app is not able to use the internet of the phone and needs 2-3 minutes to start playing again.,3
Nice but I miss being able to download songs pls can I be allowed too? Ohh I realised the only reason I could download things was because I had premium,5
Lots of ad show inside the app,1
I love Spotify so much. Although I would like a customizable UI to make it better.,5
Great app for listening to UT favorite music,5
Love the app but the add are a big problem please do something of this adds,5
YOU NEVER CAN JUST FIND THE SONG YOU ONLY FIND PLAYLIST WITH THE NAME OF THE SONG BRO IT IS SO ANOYING!!!!!!!,2
I really like the various artists that I can hear and I'm thinking about upgrading.,5
Thank you for the good music you have.,5
Good up to date music technology,5
"Too many ads, can't listen to one song with getting 4 to 5 ads after it no matter what",1
Finally I can listen to music published by my talented family around the world!,5
"Great app keep up the good work although i dont really like the new update, I dont like that you cant skip back on a song and now it just randomly plays a song from the artist not the song i want also you can only skip 6 songs an hour change that and i'll give a better review",3
"Ads every 10 minutes; random songs added to my playlist and can only skip 6 songs every hour... I literally can't listen to my playlist because I got over 6 ""recommanded songs"". I made a playlist, at least let me listen to those songs?? Trash app.",1
"went to listen to music, and found out that all my songs got deleted from my playlists",2
"Best spot for music, Spotify it! No unnecessary ads, only songs!",5
Needs to give more to the artist on it's platform,4
Very fun and good app for music.,5
"So far, so good. Good design collection as well!",5
Amazing there music is everything your want and it's no charge of pay 🙂,5
"Horrible service. Spotify hijacked my phone and now all saved audio files will only play through Spotify. Worked for 2 hours with Listya H. On chat to fix it. When they could not, they disconnected from the Chat. 2 hours wasted!",1
Music cuts out. None of the solutions work,1
Good music and easy to find,5
There was problem i will listing song than we automatically exit,3
when i try to put the songs that are on my playlist it puts on random songs that are not on my playlist,1
"I accidentally listened to a podcast I have zero interest in, and now I get notifications for it every time I open the app, with no way to delete, hide or remove it.",3
Worst lost of ad play one by one after one song 🤬🤬😡😡,1
Very poor integration with driving mode. Consistently plays random and erroneous songs when trying to make a selection using the voice assistant. Spotify pauses the assistant in driving mode when it's narrating outside of Maps. Issues reported time and time again. No fix in sight.,1
Spotify is awesome keep up the good work,5
"It was good when I first got it, I could skip and go back but now my skips are limited and I can restart it. Im not paying to skip and choose a song. I'm going to a different app",2
"Been a premium subscriber for years, worth every penny. A new album comes out and it just alerts you, very convenient, easy to use, always awesome",5
Love being able to find and listen to my favs!!!,5
It's a very good audio platform I have ever seen. I can also create my own playlist in it.,5
I love that i can leten to music and i enjoy it,5
Very very good app for listening music,5
"Aside from my account being regularly hacked and me having to remove people on a weekly basis hat i dont know,I have now lost all controls in app and on widget, no way to pause or stop, plays of you tap a song but still no control?",1
The sound quality is vary good The adds are coming in 30 min And many more things Nice work spotify 👍👍👏👏,5
1 song and 3 ads go premium if u really want to listen music,1
Everything is cool but hate ads..,4
Love Gracie's corner and the many podcasts available.,5
I love listening to Spotify,5
Good songs. Plays well. Repeats same ads back to back... not paying for premium so i expect ads not the same one over and over and over.,3
I just love music and it's easy to understand how to use this app!,5
too many advertisements,1
"Just pretty great, I've got premium and its just lovely. My only real complaint is that sometimes I don't think the shuffle is entirely random but it makes sense why that is.",5
"I honestly really don't like this app. On a phone, spotify adds songs to your playlist, FYI I hate the songs they add, YOU CAN'T EVEN LISTEN TO ONE SONG without having to listen to a WHOLE PLAYLIST. SO much advertisements. Ugh i hate it so much. This is a scam you have to download premium to be able to do simple stuff like skip a song or listen to one song. It's literally just a scam for money, I don't reccomend installing Spotify",1
This app is not for listning song its only for listning dozens of ad,1
Enjoy my experience with great music,5
This Spotify app is good. Keep up the good work.,5
So far so good... I wish i can auto play the next song tho..,4
Deletes songs every so often,4
Awesome but a bit two many commercials I don't mind some for free I expect it but it seems like there is getting to be to many,5
Can you literally not add any songs more in my perfectly fine playlist?! Like let me enjoy the SONGS THAT I ADDED!!,3
The app is so easy and fast to use I love it,5
"30 mins without interruption thats a lie, I got commercials every 2 songs, super dessapointed",1
I have premium but its easy and has all the music I love,5
I am getting too much trouble for login ..into app..,1
"Good selection of music and podcasts, terrible execution. Surprisingly Spotify, I don't what you adding whatever songs you want to my anxiety playlist and stopping me from skipping them. I get that you need cash so I can deal with the ads, but I shouldn't have to pay just to have free choice of music.",2
Very well composed allow at least 10 downloads.,4
I used to love this app but after the new update I can barely do anything without premium. It gets really annoying and just makes me want to use it less. Either make it a 100% prescription app or just put it back to normal. Would have rated it five before this.,2
"Very good, it also gives the information about where the music is being played and who is using ur account and listening to which song and if someone else is using it u can control it by ur device",5
It is super good! I really recommend this app. But why 4 stars? I love it but I think that it gives too many ads.,4
"From my phone to work to the car, seemless listening all day long.",5
They let us listen to whatever I want and I just love it!!!,5
The play list created is fantastic. I really enjoy using Spotify,5
"I've had no choice but to resort to streaming. Every conceivably convenient way of having music on my phone is defunct. Other than that I can say that it works, at least.",2
I like this site but if your going to play advertising don't play it over and over and over thats annoying. But other than that it's great. Only gave 4 stares because of the annoying add,4
Best music app i have ever used no capp🙌❤,5
My good mood was always destroyed by ads,1
"It's really good to listen to music, but it is a pain to use. The app doesn't open most times when I try and I have to press library for example, multiple times and wait at least 30 seconds to actually open the page. And every time, it doesn't connect to the speaker, I have to open it again which takes a while, and then it connects. I'm on a galaxy s9",2
Now the app is becoming worse multiple ads are being shown at an inter wal of 10-20 mins,1
So cool to fiind all my favourite songs with ther lyrics,5
"I enjoy using the Spotify app, because i can always find music which I like from many styles and sounds that I can listen to wherever I go.",5
Great app excellent content plays seamlessly on my Android devices well worth the subscription,5
"Absolutely love it! It's got so much music to choose from. I can get pretty much anything I'm looking for. From big name artist to local artist I follow here in my city. And a lot of podcasts as well. I haven't even tapped into any of the videos they have either because I'm listening to music or podcasts. I say give it a try if you haven't already. No contacts, no commitment. Always a plus.",5
Kinda BS that I have to watch an ad for 30 minutes of ad-free listening only for you guys to turn around and make me sit through FIVE ads after literally two songs. 😒,2
Why is the Spotify not working well,1
Hey Spotify what the hell is happening. I am trying to login for last 30 minutes used multiple emails an mobile number but still it's not working.,1
But middle advertisement are so bad,4
Great music app!,4
Was great . This last update messed up Android auto . Constantly shows no content now unless I reboot after coming out of a no service area . Will not reconnect when service is restored .,1
I am satisfied with it's good always. Before and after work.,5
At least improve the quality of songs in your ads. The songs you advertise are sometimes extremely cheap and you can't listen to them in front of your family.,3
Totally awesome program,5
"love it, I always rely on this for music. I also have the premium plan",5
The playlist the apps creates are great. Song suggessions are also good. 5 Stars.,5
"I like the app, but remove the fricking ads from baby sleep playlists!",4
"You should fix this, I play my favorite song in playlist but it play different songs.....1 star",1
Absolutely love Spotify ❤️,5
It's ok but the thing is that there is add and it's rlly annoying,2
Best music platform i have ever used,5
"Terrible. It keeps adding songs to my playlists and I can't listen to my god damn playlists without it playing songs I never added. I can't even count how many times I swore in Russian, Spanish, Italian, and English.",1
"I love the app , it's filled with all my favourite songs but the ads between, i hate em. So, shove your ads in ur as.",4
One of the best audio apps in the ganr,5
"LOVE IT !!! (exept from the free version that ive got) atverts every three songs.doesnt let you choose wich song to play. AND YOU HAVE ONLY 6, I REPEAT 6 SKIPS",5
Very ease of access,5
There is only one thing that I hate is when your Spotify thing runs out you always get ads But still amazing app,4
Very nice application.User friendly.,4
"Intentionally harassing with adds, if u not subscribe they'll show you hell",2
Awesome music but could have been better like YouTube music,5
"2 star because you guys become so boring, can you please cancel the car mode..i wanna play the video when the car on stop or stram it in my car screen ...thats why youtube is the best..stop acting like you car about the road accident and make the choice up to user ..stop controlling",2
It's a good streaming app u just gatta go to premium for the real fun,4
I can listen to BTS and all kinds of songs anywhere and all time thanks to Spotify 💜💜,5
"I have been using this app from more than a year but now it has become so tough to use this app whenever I open this app it shows your are offline, there is no problem in my wifi network cause the other apps are working really good ..... whenever I try to log in to my existing account it shows that you are offline....I want you to solve this problem soonest possible Thank you ❤️",1
"Since last few weeks the app is not working ,it only shows something went wrong",1
It has one of the finest metal collection so yes /m\,5
Too many ads for 20 minutes,1
Good that one chooses what to listen to.,5
"Works fine. As long as Spotify is home of JR podcast, I'll be subbed",5
Worst chrome book app that exists. It keeps shutting down by itself. Uninstalling and then installing again does not work! Fix this please!,1
This is the best!! I recommend you this apps to hear a song and there are many cool recommended song that you should listen!!!,5
Most of the songs I loved can be found here. Easy to use. Great experience!,5
There should be an option to edit home screen,4
Really loving it n keeps my mood always 💯,5
"Back in the day, Spotify was really good. You could use the free version, try it out and then decide if you want to buy it or not. A lot of premium functions where on the free version and the only thing you could do with the premium was download the songs. Now days they have become money grabbers. That's the only thing they think of. The free version is unusable. You cannot play a specific song , they add more song to you playlist and force you to buy it. I guess everything is money these days.",1
"Fantastic variety--music for every mood, for travel, for meditation, for fun 'n' frolic!!",5
"Worst app I've ever used. Constantly crashes, alwayd has connection problems even when on 4g and all other apps work fine",1
"It's a good app with premium but as soon as it runs out you have ads and you can't skip songs if you do it to much for a hour, A FLIPPING HOUR!! so I only really recommend if you can afford premium",3
Never go offline. The app won't let you sign back in until you change it to online mode. Too bad you need to sign back in to change it back. It's such a stupid problem.,1
This is the best music player ever but sometimes I can't download music using cellular data but still it's a five star for me cause I love it 😍,5
I like it but it would be better if all songs had substitiles,3
Songs were just stoped while using,3
I like the way it broadens my horizons with similar music. I I found Spotify through Last FM. Last FM kept dumping me into Spotify. What the heck is scrabbling?! Where is the tutorial. Learning curve wasn't as bad as I thought.,5
"all the songs are available and the sound quality also great, the data useage is less in the this app but the ads are awfull!!!!!",4
I love using Spotify... It's easier to listen to songs and genres I prefer.,5
"Everything is exceptional with the app Only one thing would make it even better, a default playlist for all the downloaded songs",5
The app is good but playing songs sometimes I difficult,5
I have been with this app for 5 months. I was late on my bill but payed it. I lost over 3000 if not more songs. Poof gone. 5 months of selections. Got everything.back. i love using spotify,5
"Mp3 songs best quality but 3 & 4 songs 30 second ads extra....,",2
"Worst experience, automatic advertisements play suddenly even if you you are not playing any song, merely installed went to office and it plays advertisements automatically. Doesnt even show the playing advertisement in apps runing section. Really worst app... Recommend everyone to uninstall.",1
Most buggy piece of software I'm forced to use,2
Music the universal language at my fingertips. Spotify is the backtrack to my visual Mindscapes,5
Great app for music having a wide range but some features should be free Like replaying songs and non shuffle. (Free version) But overall spotify is a useful app for music offering high quality for a affordable price. (Premium),5
"Best app for enjoying your on road ride and your idle time, dont search too many webistes, all in 1 place",5
Well the app is amazing tbh great playlists i use it all the time but sometimes it has this weird bug where i cant see the song im playing or skip thru it (even tho i have premium) which gets suuuper frustrating especially caus im paying for it,4
Group session can't work properly!,1
Good song play!,4
Soo many ads and lyrics not showing pls fix this the ads keep popping up after every 2 songs and which is soo annoying....,2
That the best app to listening music,5
Everything is awesome . Although your premium is little expensive but i still have it. Myy only concern is when you guys gonna fix mic drop option. It will change Spotify totally . Its awesome. I tried once i dont remember it worked for one song . Now its useless,5
"😋: I like a lot! | • Proposal Allow 😋: Share ""My Library"" 😋: Share "" My Favorite song list"" 😋: Share ""My Favorite users"" "" My Favorite users list"" Share share The Share option should be handy for easier use. Thank you! 😋: How to find a user's lists in Spotify. 😋: And how do you find a user or lists of other users so you can listen to lists from them ... 😋: Or it doesn't work to see the lists from other users ... 😋: Share ""My Favorite users"" "" My Favorite users list""...",5
Great music lovers appreciate it.,5
Best music streaming service ever,5
"Everything is good in this app... But there should be Suggestions option for hit and good music of any time, according to play preference of the users...",3
Spotify on mobile is super trash i cant even change the music i want,1
"What the hell, spotify, I didnt ask you to add more songs to my playlist. You also took away tge ability to play individual songs and rearrange songs in playlists",1
Why can't I listen to a preview of a song before adding it to my playlist and why is it that everytime I try to continue my music from earlier it doesn't play the song til I skip to the next song and come back its really annoying,2
"When my playlist song is done, it started playing random suggested song and wont play back my playlist. It is annoying and I also recieve alot of ads after just listening to a song from my playlist",2
"This app is genuinely pissing me off. Can't listen to the songs I pick as somehow the app picks something completely unrelated instead. I'm not willing to spend money on features that I have for free on other streaming apps, but it would seem Premium is the only option for this app to even have a good experience. I'm uninstalling.",1
Favourite music App.,5
After all these years I still can't delete the current song from the playlist that's playing without having to scroll through all songs (1000+) in the playlist to find that one song that's currently playing.,1
Lots to listen to. I use on long car journeys or while doing dishes or housework or outside pitting clothes out on the line or in the supermarket...Mr Ballan and The African Diaries are my go too but I listen to music and get spiritual inspiration and encourage there also. Pet peeve is that if I pick a music genre the app only plays the first 1 or 2 from my chosen artist or type of music. So I have to keep checking the phone and charging it back to my choice. That's pretty annoying& frustrating.,5
This is the best app for music. But I'm not able to listen to ANY of Badshah's songs.. like seriously.. it's been like this from a very long time.. but I'm fed-up of it now.. it's a really good app and this is the only app I use for music.. please fix this for me ASAP,3
Amazing podcast for me,5
Spotify is amazing,5
"Have had pathetic experience of using the app recently. Even when I was logged in and all the songs from any of presaved playlist were played, app showed no internet connection issue while I used to search. For the very same reason I uninstalled and reinstalled the app as well. But it didn't help. I hope the developers look into this as a serious concern. If not solved ASAP, users might end up with other music streaming platforms. Which I already have been shifted to and have uninstalled the app",1
Very bad app now a lot of ads and it get stops while playing songs but before the update it was really good and now it's no more good and i am gonna uninstall it,1
"Whenever you hit pause for an extended period of time (5 minutes+) The list you are listening to resets & will keep replaying songs that have already passed in that session. The list should continue from where you left off. NOT reset & start replaying everything. That is, unless you reset the playlist yourself. Very frustrating glitch in the app",3
Love love love! User friendly and vast selection of music.,5
An amazing experience of songs on Spotify.,5
"It is more preferable app for musics and etc....but songs are not playing by single touch on song name...even sometimes like songs not displayed,,,,then I have to restart App!!!!!...",3
I have had an Enjoyable ad free experience with spotify's Premium Plan where I could play music offline💎 And stream my favourite music and Djs💯,5
Great at playing everything but the songs I want to listen to.,1
"This app is the best .I just listened to all of my favorite songs .I like is, this is the best.",5
Its a very nice and fabulous app that makes one enjoy music.....there 8s no need of filling phones with downloaded music....,5
It's pretty good for listening to music but sometimes it can interfere with discord sounds. Spotify on phone is annoying because I can't choose the song I want on my liked list like I can with my discover weekly. Also why can't I shuffle my liked list on phone but I can't on my desktop. (Keep in mind I don't have premium.) The adds aren't an issue really. Spotify on phone and Spotify on desktop is two different experiences.,3
Very nice means for your favourite songs.,5
The best music experience you can ever have...,5
"Free version sucks, pay to play music version is my favorite music app.",5
Good app but add fre is premium .,5
Great selection of music to keep everyone entertained,5
Too many ads,1
"It's pretty good. But, after the new update, i actually become pretty confused. I can't play the songs i want, when i clicked the song, it's just a clip of the song. It keep playing shuffle, I don't know how to turn the shuffle off. Can you please fix this 🥺 ?? I've searched on YT how to solve this problem, but, currently, there's no tutorial for this. And they said the only solution is you should move to Spotify premium. It's not just me who's struggling with this problem 🙏🏻",4
Hands down best music app,5
Started to crash anytime I try to play a podcast,4
Simply the best music app out there,5
Spotify provides an immense range of accssessing music and podcasts casts.,5
A premium Spotify member and I have issues with Spotify turning itself off or not playing whole songs and then starting up again. I don't feel like I should pay for something that does not work properly I've tried the tricks with logging out of everything and making sure the apps are closed instead of suspended. still doesn't work. Please addressed and resolved. thank you. If there was a app that gave me what spotify does without the problems and charged me more I'm would switch without a doubt,2
Does the job minus the ads but it's bearable,4
Great experience I have been using this app recently alot It's great But sometimes the song I play doesn't play alot of issues have occurred I would recommend u to download but you network quality should be good 😝😝,5
Excellent stream of music,5
"Can not play anything i have 2 accounts ive followed all help prompts, cant fix the issue cant see the play option persists that im set to offline when im not and my internet works perfectly on other apps. Im not paying an app i cant use het solutions for easily.",1
3 stars cz i don't have money to buy premium 😁😂,3
My absolute favorite music app! I just wish it could be a little more organized when you search things up or like with the podcasts and shows. There are also way too many ads. I understand they need them for it to be free but dang.,4
Still waiting for the day Spotify introduces Direct Message feature.,5
I am having a great time with spotify. I have found songs long lost here. I love it!,5
Good to hear from you and thanks for the songs and joy :),5
Amazing app super sufficient i get all the music i wanna hear so time efficient too,5
It is a nice app but if you haven't taken Spotify premium the add is going to suck your blood 🩸 litterly,5
"spotify just randomly crashed on me today -_- pls maybe its just the day, its been weird since i woke up but this is annoying. lagging a lot, app keeps closing by itself and doesnt open, and it keeps freezing the screen and idk its just not working :< other than that its normally a decent music app, love that u can make playlists and they have a pretty wide variety of music so its all good when its working i guess :)",3
"Best & most Awesome App you can find. For international music there is no match for this app in India. Not just some songs-albums-lyrics since 1990s or 1980s, as a music afficianado you can get classics even till 1940s. There is even all recorded songs of Little Walter from 1920s, the 1st+only solo artist to be inducted into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for Harmonica. Incredible range & quality. Also Lyrics for 90% of Songs. Top auto-playlist-recommends. Best free for few ads.",5
Spotify has the potential of being the best music app ever but they only want money and you add ads between almost ever 3-4 songs?? Not to mention u cant take off shuffle or listen to individual songs on mobile but can only do it on TV or laptop which is ridiculous.,3
Horrible app you make a playlist and spotify decides to add in the worst songs imaginable you cant get rid of then you do it and it adds other gay songs hoorible app you cant even listen to one song by its self worst music app in the world you only get to skip a few of songs and then your band stupid app fix it for christ sakes,1
Good application for lovers of music,5
Spotify is my #1 favorite application for music,5
Last update is so disappointing. You cannot play a single song without playing playlist. Shufft on playlist is pathetic,1
Works horribly. And what about the 30 minute break before ads? That surely isn't the case here,1
Need accurate song lyrics,3
"this used to be my favourite app - i'd use it every single day for way too long and rave about it. now spotify is just killing itself. the ui has gotten significantly worse, what with podcasts being continuously pushed in your face, and the extremely slow and buggy scrolling. i've been a premium listener for about two years, and my once astounding quality music has sounded dull, even with better headphones and many adjustments of the equalizer setting. that being said, i love this app",3
Easy way to find my music and podcast for a great price and best sound!,5
Love it I can jam to one band of my choosing and any album of choice (the whole album) without any interuption!!!!!,5
Love how Spotify always plays what I want to hear! And I love the lyrics section and the hand- picked Playlists!! Can't live without it!,5
So far so good keep up the good job,4
"When I got spotify first it was good till 2 weeks later it, it played diffrent music from the ones I wanted to play plus I can not choose a specific song and I have play it from the start and can only skip 6 times an hour and it limits what I what I was able to do.",1
"Only annoyance is when I get in the car and turn on Bluetooth, a pop-up shows up right over the Car Mode button asking if I want to connect to speakers, even tho it's already connected to Bluetooth. This pop-up can not be swiped away, and I just have to wait it out to be able to switch to Car Mode.",5
I'm happy that the app allows you to download podcasts but I wish you can download the whole pllist at once instead of putting each podcast one at a time which cause you to miss click without noticing. And since you can't custom your own playlist you would have to start all over with the downloads to get the right order. PLS FIX AND ADD THIS FEATURE!!!,3
Spotify music best song app,5
This app is good with the custom mixes/playlists based off of music that you like and it also has a wide variety of songs but I really dislike the fact that this app has too many ads and that it celebrates pride month even though you're personality matters instead of your sexuality when producing music.,3
"It's great, really. Though I can't play any of the recommended songs I want to add into my playlist. It kinda sucks because once i add most of them into the playlist. They aren't even my ""thing"" or what I'm looking for.",3
"I love this application,its most used app on my phone..",3
"I don't really like the new update, I think it's unfair to only have 6 skips per hour cause it depends on the mood whether I wanna listen to it or skip it.",2
Very nice quality of voice,5
"Excellent and easy to use via streaming to my Marantz receiver,great sound and large catalogue.",5
"It's been a long time for me to heard anykind of song from this app(spotify), especially for korean pop song. Then suddenly, after my latest update for the released new version this app having overflow lacks for it's sytem. As instance: when i still play onto my music, the song stopped out of the blue despite my provider is stable plus there's no disruption either,and other lack in some feature which likely to much for me to write it all here. For world's sake, please develop it beter odeveloper",3
"So I've been a spotify user for over a year but the app currently logged me out of my premium account that I can seem to get back, everything on my account is not accessible in the app but only in the web browser. Is there any way I can fix this promblem? It's frustrating me",4
Hiding podcast removes it from home screen only for 90 days! That should be permanent,1
"I CAN'T PLAY SOME SONGS, it always says, ""Something Went Wrong"" and i can't liked some songs. PLEASE fix this!.",2
It's good . The only negative thing is the ads . The ads are mainly just their premium which removes ads but the only ad is the premium. It doesn't make sense,4
Awesome experience using the app. I should have downloaded it a long time ago. The seamless play with no adverts is it for me,5
"Im on paid subscription but i can't keep this shuffle button off, whenever i play, it will automatically turn on. I uninstalled the app, clear cache and log out on all devices but it is still on.",1
"I Really Like What I Can Do, Like What I Mean Is I Can Make Playlist's & Not 1 Add Has Appeared. I Really Like This Thank you",5
"Exceptional, stupendous,change nothing! You can improve on things if it's necessary as per me, i am satisfied. There's none like close to Spotify.The ability to play and replay music have put Spotify in a place where no other can attend or reach. In my world, all is Spotify 24/7 all year long. The opportunity to sing along declares Spotify the sole medium of music for me.I have the ability to learn the lyrics of my favorite songs and artists. All hell Bravissimo Spotify in my 🛖.",5
App is great just the ads are too annoying,5
I can't play the song that I wanted to hear it just shuffle into a different song that I never heard of,1
"i absolutely love this app, but it won't let me subscribe to a premium plan. i am a student discount beneficiary and everytime i try to subscribe through mobile payment, it only shows me the ""oops, something went wrong message."" i have tried troubleshooting several times but there has been no solution. i have been stuck trying to figure out this problem for a few days now. please fix this, i have been a premium subscriber for a year and this is the first that has ever happened to me.",2
Is the best music keep it up,5
"its already been a yr n ur not even updating us, ive red the other reviews n we ALL have the SAME PROBLEMS! its not fair for us because we have to buy premium in order to unshuffle it? horrible service if u ask me. idc bout u updating the spotify, what we said needs to be done. not be ignored",1
One n only requirement is option to download songs for free,1
I love this app it has all kpop groups songs,5
"How about instead of the ""We added"" part you just let me have my playlist JUST with what I added?",2
App doesn't let me create a almost it constantly kicks me out to the app store and it freezes up when trying to select a channel doesn't play music app is trash after this update please fix or are u trying to force premium on us now will change when it goes back to normal loved the app before now,1
One of the best apps I downloaded so far. I get great use out of it.,5
"I love it! I can't go to sleep without listening to some podcasts or playlists, but there are some issues.First you can just skip 6 songs an hour and it's just annoying sitting there listening to songs you don't even like. Next whenever i try to go to spotify the play and back and forward button are gray and wont even let me touch them, it will also say nothing is playing. Please fix this and no it's not my device because i tried it on others and still dosen't work. Otherwise i really enjoy it.",4
Excellent music suggestions,5
"The app was really good until the latest update (06/23/22) , the layout is now confusing and everytime i switch to another tab the music is either choppy or cuts out. You need to pay for a bunch of things now which are very unnecessary. As a person that really enjoyed using spotify before this update i'd rather use youtube for my music, it seems like your getting a bunch of complaints from this update. I'd remove it before you loose spotify listeners too because im not paying for my music.",2
"Genuinely disappointed wanted to listen to the good the bad and the ugly instead I got some other song and couldn't even select it because I'm a free user, what a scam",1
For me I really enjoy it because I can access music that is not available on other music apps. They have a great selection of music and podcasts along with a great setup. The only thing that I don't like is that the fact that there is no offline mode. I enjoy listening to music on car trips but it makes it difficult to access anything because of it. That's the only thing about it that bothers me. Otherwise I highly recommend it!,4
Being able to listen to most of my favorite bands albums is amazing and listening to it offline is even better,5
Spotify is so annoying i wanna play my playlist/like musics but it goes to a different song like from suggested songs,1
Great way to savor your favorite hits.,5
This stupid app keeps turning itself off in the middle of listening to something and sometimes won't go to the next episode of a podcast.,2
Always informs me when new albums or singles I might like drop,5
"I hate this app now like seriously after the new update it's all changed like I can't even repeat the song and it's all in a playlist and it all pissed me off I deleted this app and I'm using another apps to listen songs cuz who would like to pay for songs, there are more apps🙄",1
"Suddenly the app is ""no longer compatible with your device"". I wonder why spotify is suddenly not for the recent Galaxy",1
"Giving this four stars because now, before I listen to any podcast I follow, I hear at least 3 ads before the actual podcast episode I tapped play on actually plays.",4
"This the worst music app ever. When you want to listen ""a"" song and they will give you a long playlist",1
I can't get myself out from the house or car this music is the best thing I ever need to get my situation going on with the music you have it is such a variety of Great music so keep up with the good music you guys I love it !!!!!!!,5
Too many ads after every other song,2
this app is ok but adds sometime broke the perfect part but i love it tho,5
"Normally love my premium but since the last update, if I have podcast and music on the same playlist. When the podcast ends, the music doesn't play like before. And that's very annoying it just closes the app. When I'm in a busy work day I'd like my playlist to play like it should. And not make me need to open the app again to select music. Please fix.",3
Please tell me how to stop the app from turning itself on as I'm driving!! nothing like music randomly blaring to cause an accident! Really opening yourself up to a lawsuit spotify.,1
60 second ad every 3 minute song.,1
Why do you add songs to my Playlist and I put them out but more come in please fix that if you could please do thank you,3
You should be able to make and sort a playist however you want.,2
Spotify could you make it so that we can see our song and playlist just that playlist busily before you updated spotify piz??? It was good the way it was before you updated it.,3
Getting more glitchy. Integration with HEOS is horrible and unstable. Please fix!,1
"I have a Premium Plan I use on a Samsung, but after the latest update I can't listen to anything at all. It tells me I don't have internet when I do. It tells me all the playlists are empty. If I look up a song, it won't play it. I have deleted the app, restarted my phone and reinstalled. I have cleared the cache and data and then done all of those steps. I have done the ""clean reinstall"" steps. The only time I can get the app to function is if my SD card is not in my phone. Not a solution.",1
Worst never download this one U can try resso and wynk and other all but compared to all this is worst . It u didn't take premium membership 24×7 adds i am getting 1min add after one song I request u try resso is better,1
I put five stars but if I have any issues then I wont hesitate to come back and GLADLY set it at 4 again 😳😇,5
Easy to access,4
Great selection of music and the ability to quickly create your own playlist that can be public or private.,5
"I avail a premium last 3 months, which i really enjoyed and didnt think that the subscription will be today, i didnt get ANY NOTIFICATIONS, that my spoti is ending, and it stole like $3 on my acc, not much but when u equate it to ph money, its like, 149. Which I've been saving so I could buy more important things, wish you would notify us next time. This is really frustrating lol",2
I loved this app but I updated it and it took away my shuffle button won't let me pick out what song to play won't let me restart a song and you are no longer allowed to skip songs more than 6 times per hour and from some of the reviews other people are experiencing the same things I would like for this to be fixed please,1
The best app ever I used apple music and then I used SoundCloud and then I loved Spotify ʕ´• ᴥ•̥`ʔ,5
The best music app. P@NDOR@ SCKS!,5
Needs a little more volume... other than that... almost perfect,4
"Fix you stupid Bluetooth connext, I'm having to use an old version of the app because you broken Bluetooth connect functionality",2
Don't have canvas feature just boring..,1
It keeps taking over my phone and car and auto playing stuff. Even though I turned autoplay off it continues to insist on autoplaying stuff and overriding SiriusXM 8n the car,1
The app is not letting me play any song or open any of my playlist ...after the recent update ... please fix it soon🤌,1
Can't get certain songs but overall this app is great,5
"This is one of the best app for leastining the song. In this app the haryanvi and Punjabi song lyrics are not in Hindi, its lyrics are in haryanvi and Punjabi. But the other app like resso any language song lyrics are available in Hindi, and this is the main drawback (demerit) of this app for music lovers. Thank you ❣️",4
Works amazing and I'm finding songs I haven't heard in a long time,5
My go-to streaming app. It's Spotify: what else is there to say?,5
"Used to love spotify until everytime I try to play my playlists, it plays other songs and I turned off autoplay and it still doesn't work. Spotify is only doing this for money",1
"Another broken update? None of the song radios work. Playlists I listened to yesterday now say deleted... All of them. Spotify works great and does exactly what I want 90% of the time... But if it doesn't work the first time, every time, it's not good enough. Don't push broken updates. Edit: you lost another star for breaking your app with bad updates. You've altered your algorithm and all the ""song radio"" are playing things things that are not the same genre and songs I've never heard of.",2
I gave this a low rating only because when I downloaded the app NOW it started screwing with my phone to the point where I had to delete it. The app never did it a year ago it just started and it is still the same phone,2
Very good mood settings..satisfied and approved!,5
"The BEST music app out there. I want play anything but SPOTIFY, its the only music app worth downloading! Thankyou SPOTIFY, for all the New&Old Best tunes from KickAss Music that reaches our ears each day bc of SPOTIFY!! ThankYou.",5
"(26/06/21) App used to be really good but now since the updates. it keeps telling me I have no internet connection, and wont let me search my downloaded songs. Plus payments have gone up and barely get any use out of the app.. as it won't let you use it offline even though you've paid the fee..hopefully this will be resolved soon. And it is still the same(26/06/22) if not worse I am wanting to cancel my memebership and use another service because of this rubbish",1
"I use premium, app crashes alot when i open it, seems to only do it for JRE podcast.",3
"I don't know what I would do without this app (although the shuffle feature needs a little work. I understand Spotify can see what I prefer to listen to, but I enjoy variety over listening to the same stuff over and over).",4
The app used to work very smoothly before but now the app don't work at all . I am not able to play any music . It was an ugly experience for me . Plss fix this quickly .,1
Music keeps stopping. Very frustrating,2
Works great and tons of selection.,5
Too much advertise,2
"It's a good app though but too much ads it's very distracting or frustrating you can't even skip an ad and have basic features but only exist in premium like downloading offline, listen to all songs simultaneously (I.G., every song is shuffle), moving the timestamp etc.",1
I really enjoy the company of spotify . Thank you so much,5
Forces phone to restart when i open the app and download feature non- functional. I bought the premium mainly for the download for offline play feature but cant even download 1 song. Overall so slow and laggy,1
Spotify have everything that you could possibly want to listen to.,5
I wish they would let u put your play list in alphabetical order. That why I only gave four stars,4
"Beautiful App helps concentrate even when I don't want to, like now, and will hear some soft, meditative songs of own choice and will accelerate my day with refreshness and productivity. - Damodar Boruah, Author, Assam",4
Every time the youtube TV add plays it repeats 3 times it's annoying,3
Ok it's good it has all my fav songs but there sould be an option to play a playlist in order or to just listen to a single song with out it going to a completely different song that is why I'm giving it a 3,3
This is an exceptional music streaming service. The pros of going premium far outweighs the cons. I'm going to enjoy it very much but please bring back the anime tab on the discover page,5
Awesome content with even obscure bands available.,5
"No matter how many times I click my playlist, it only plays suggested songs",2
So amusing to hear music from your site without hustle of too much ad.,5
I love this app! I pick everything from Patsy Cline to Jefferson Airplane and end up with hip hop!! Spotify all day long! Thank you for your app!,5
Almost all the basic features of a music player--as basic as selecting a specific song to listen to--are premium only. The desktop version is fine but the mobile version is useless because of this.,1
I use the app literally daily. I have just one problem when I upload the playlist photo it will stay there until I close the playlist. Once I open it again the photo won't be there. Please let me know if there is a way to fix this. Other then that I love the app.,4
My favorite music always.,5
Best Music App!,5
"Android app is trash. Like many other people, the app does not work with wifi. I have to disconnect from wifi everytime I want to use the app (and remember to reconnect to wifi when I'm finished using the app). Inconvenient and disappointing - especially coming from a multibillion dollar company.",1
"App constantly crashes. Personally, I have a hard time navigating. The list of recently played songs should be easier to access from your queue. My queue constantly clears when I accidentally click a song (when I may just want to go to the album or add it to my queue) but then when I try to start a new playlist, it will go back to a queue I had from days ago. Also very annoying that podcasts and music are all together, so it's hard to go back to your queue after listening to a podcast.",2
I have had Spotify for years and I love it. It is user friendly! I listen to podcasts on my way to work in the mornings and music at night. Best app ever!,5
When I lock my phone the music stop until I pick up my phone again and open it how do I get rid of this feature 😒,1
"Why am I even paying for premium? App constantly deletes downloads (yeah yeah, ""please clear your cache or try a fresh install"" is getting real tiresome), offline search isn't working, app is slow on startup, etc.",1
I got to enjoy my fave songs instantly!!!,5
Been able to listen to music that I haven't heard for years thank you Spotify,5
Reduse some ads,4
Cannot play an album without the app giving suggested songs.,2
Love this ap. Better than pandora by far.,5
30 min. No adds or interruptions is a LIE ! And why playing songs not on my playlist . If you were honest I would get premium.,1
"I love Spotify as a whole - it has everything i look for in a music app. But constant issues with the functionality are very annoying. It stops playing and crashes all the time, the progress bar randomly stops displaying the accurate place in songs and podcasts, and sometimes doesn't connect to my Bluetooth speaker. I don't have any of those problems on the desktop app. Edit: 6/25/2022 and still having the same issues. No attempts to fix them whatsoever.",1
Great App wishyou could loop the song you want without premium.,4
"It's great I'm not gonna lie I can pretty much enjoy listening to it while ny phones off. I gave it a 1 star because of the fact that I need premium for loop on,listen to the songs in order from my playlist,and tap in the song of what I specifically wanted. But the ad isn't exactly the problem on why I gave it 1 star due to it being common for me to encounter some. But point being this sucks without the premium and that I rather go back on YouTube then this.",1
"I can't play a song whatever way I want. I can't play one song at once and unless I get premium, I can't replay a song unless I play all the other songs on a playlist. It limits too much things.",2
I am really enjoy spotify app,5
It is a banger to listen to music I know some say why can't u listen to any song u choose on your playlist but they have to make money after all,5
I love this app and trust me the premium is definitely worth it,5
"Was good now it just doesn't work! Was fine last week then 3 days ago can't access anything on the app. Says no internet connection which is a lie as it's working for anything else. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, logging off and on, restarting phone and still not working. Grrr am going on a long road trip and want to be able to play the Playlist I want. Can't even play recommend Playlist! Might have to cancel subscription!",1
Good music 🎶 easy to find what you want to hear,5
This app has become an abomination and is completely unusable now. Spent hours trying to figure it out.,1
Two average-length songs and more commercials. I'm actually keeping track. TWO songs. Not even TV is proportionate in it's commercial to viewing ratio.,1
Great app! just wish i didnt have to buy Spotify premium to listen to music for free :(,5
Great selections & playlists!,5
Don't like it cause you need to pay money to just listen what you wanna hear and I'm not gonna be having 60 different songs to just listen what I want to hear,2
Loved this app in the beginning. I could choose where I wanted my playlist to start off at... Now that you have updated the app I can no longer do that... On my tablet I have the older version of Spotify where I can pick the song that I want to start with... I just wish it was back to the way it was before this update that they had.... Still love the app though.,4
Everything I need; my educational podcasts and favorite music,5
Internet connection often gets lost when i have full connectivity on other apps. Songs often fail to play. The home screen rarely updates. It takes ages to load albums that i have downloaded and saved locally. I pay $15 a month for all this disappointment along with a very comprehensive music library which is still rad when it chooses to work.,2
It's the best app in the store. Couldn't live without it.,5
I don't have ads on Spotify I got premium and I've had premium for years and I will never ever go to any other streaming service for music it is the best streaming service you can find anything on there hands down the best music app ever.,5
This is dumb it won't let you do anything unless you have permuim and it adds songs to my playlist that I don't want and I can't even click the song that I do want to hear and it's agrivating and annoying I can't play songs on loop unless I get premium I honestly think this app is only for people who can actually afford to listen to the music which is unfair,1
This is an awesome app its so easy to use.Ive been using this app for a while now but there IS one problem...when u create a Playlist they add random songs and play it which sometimes just ruins the vibe,4
So many freaking ads 😠😠😠,1
4 stars because there's always room for improvement,4
"I enjoy the app overall but I am giving 3 stars because the app constantly switches output device even tho I am not interacting with it. It's kinda annoying coz one minute I was listening to a song, next minute it went silent.",3
Great music until I only got six skips per hour. What is up with that?,1
Worst this app only 3 or 4 songs skip Advestament,1
Useless app. I had a free account for 3 months and never used it a single time. Just use youtube.,1
"App continuously stops when phone screen darkens on android, they are not issuing any fixes.",1
Spotify has always worked just fine for me just wish premium was free but hey Rome wasn't built in a day,5
Love it accept commercials,5
"I have to say that I'm impressed! Put in my prefered artists, and the app made playlists that are exactly what I like! I've listened to over 20 hours of music, and skipped less than 10 songs. Well done! Well worth the price. Wish more apps worked this well...",5
The latest update makes the app crashes everytime I open it. Needs to be relaunched everytime… :/,1
Love the intuitive play lists.,5
"Offers free music of all kinds. Really an awesome app to listen to music anytime, anywhere. I have this music app for three years now and it's one of the best-if not the best!",5
Worst music app honestly. Keeps logging me out almost everyday.,1
"Horrible horrible horrible 😭😭😭 I just wanted to listen to music, why'd you have to make me go thru all that😭",1
thank you a lot...for the music,5
Great music library. I hope there was some option to change theme in the future.,4
exceptional app.. the new version is amazing!,5
Good finds most artists from most decade's,4
"The app was amazing when I could scroll through my Playlist. But after the update I can't. You can shuffle it and stuff but you can't scroll though and pick your music, that's why I downloaded in the first place because I could scroll through and pick the song I wanted and it would play from there. I don't know if this is a me problem but it's really irritating me and I might have to switch apps. Please fix this as soon as you can.",1
"They added the feature to hide undesired episodes from your home screen on the cellphone, which was really good. But the feature isn't on Playstation Devices. Those frustrating ""recommended"" episodes still appear on my home screen!!! I've tried turning on Restricted Mode and hiding them from my cellphone but they're still on my home screen when I log in to the app from my PS4. It's so frustrating!!! I didn't even listen to podcasts and they recommended me 18+ stuff that I definitely don't want!",1
Just don't like it when the song stops and starts,4
Ad to music ratio is abysmal. Literally open the app and it plays the same 2 ads back to back okay thats cool then plays 2 songs and then I gotta listen to 6 ads? You're ads manager (whatever their actual worthless title is) should be locked in a room only listening to the ads. You're literally driving people insane till they purchase premium. Very scummy.,1
"constant ads. not only that but my mixes no longer give me the option to choose which song i want, now it's presented as regular playlists. how the hell is it supposed to know my music taste if i can't even choose what i listen to?",2
It sucks when I played a song it played a completely different song fix this now Spotify 😡😡😡😡🤬😡😡😡😠,1
Good app for your favorite songs,5
"Kept adding songs to my playlist and making me listen to songs that I didn't want to listen to, terrible app.",1
You can search for every music you love the most,5
I downloaded spotify to try it on my phone and its not lettting me play any songs its absolute garbage,1
It's cool. Best selection of music I've seen of all the services I've used.,5
It's getting harder and harder to hear the songs I want without resorting to paying for premium. I'm currently looking at other streaming options because I'm so fed up with shuffle play.,2
It's just perfect... the best app ever!,5
I personally use this app for podcasts and it's really easy to use. For music however this company doesn't seem to fairly pay artists on the platform and you can't play a specific song you want. You'd have to play a playlist and in creating a playlist spotify will sometimes mix in other songs that it decides are similar enough to other songs in your playlist. Just overall frustrating unless you're using it for podcasts exclusively like me.,2
This app is amazing I love it so much and definitely recommend it,5
The best music app i ever had!,5
No longer working with Android Auto,2
I have subscribed to premium and I have paid for 2 months already and still het adds and can't listen to music off line,1
please instead of shuffling through songs until we find what we initially searched for... make a play next button and let those other songs line up to play after the song we searched,3
I can't log intoon it with my Facebook account in the APP,2
What's up with the volume being too low on android auto? It's way too low.,2
"Very great app bought premium it worth it, even when I had to get rid of it I asked and then helped me un premium it was very helpful",5
Amazing but a little more like YouTube 👍,4
Good when the app isn't broken. Constantly pausing my music isn't fun,1
Just awesome they have every song that I wanna listen too,5
This app is very helpful to play all legand singer songs. Thanku spotify .♥,5
We really are enjoying Spotify.,5
"Unreliable updates and changes. Please add useful features like pausing my randomized playlist, switching to another playlist and then jumping back into my randomized playlist without restarting the randomizer. Please remove one touch song playing. Very frustrating to scroll through a big list, accidentally touch a song and lose my spot in my playlist.",3
Everything I want to listen has been great,5
I took a 3 month trial subscription but I can't seem to be able to use the app at all.. I have gone back to my older app for music after trying to run the app million times. My only concern now is that it says it will charge me after my trial ends and I can't find how to end my subscription. Very unresponsive team haven't had any reply from them on my last review..,1
Love it! Best Music app to have.,5
The greatest place other than home (spinning vinyl) to play and hear music.,5
Very very ads I request all my friends please 🙏🙏 bring down the rating of this app. Because it contains lot of ads.,1
Cancelling my subscription. Going back to peace and quiet.,1
"I have switched to YouTube music a while ago, and must confess I haven't appreciated this platform. Now I find it is much better. 5 star easy",5
A very amazing app. really helpful on stress full days,5
The best music app ever,5
"All I know is Spotify, its the only music app I would really use.",5
"Spotify working very bad connected via Bluetooth in the car! I have Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus. Bluetooth version - 5.0, A2DP.... the music constantly breaks, stops and begins. Is there a solution to this problem?",1
This app is my fav but there are many issues to fix in means like in YouTube there is dawload video so when no network but fun.But there is no options for this or else this app is nice.,4
The best music streaming service I've seen. And I've used most of 'em.,5
"Downloaded it , first few months 1 comercial for every 2 songs now I get 4 comercials per song. They Amp up comercials like crazy. Many of the comercials are for liberal companies like Facebook asking for more power to silence people and companies looking to diversify so no white people need apply to those I guess.",2
Annoying amount of ads Ads pop up every 2 songs Rest assured spotify is a great app,2
Spotify is now becoming very worse it is playing adds for every two songs all time distance and also less sound for songs,2
Excellent songs to change the moods,5
Great selection of tunes.,5
Very nice app 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 works very nicely 👌👌 less data consuping and I recommend everyone to download the app,5
"Everything is really good. easy to use, good design, big community and song collection. Hope for better sound quality. And maybe some social features, could really raise the time spent on app. More widgets please.",5
Outstanding service to me! My playlist will blow your mind OMG! 💜💜❤💜💜💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💣💣💣💣,5
I changed my long time five star review to one star because Spotify on Samsung is terrible. The update causes it stop working constantly. This review is from a premium user. Maybe it was five star before because I had an iPhone and spotify didn't constantly stop working. Now I have to force stop it in my phone settings anytime I want it to work properly. Whoever made this update really messed up. I hope you guys take these 1 star reviews in consideration because spotify used to be good.,1
"The app is awesome you also can listen k-pop songs here, you can choose your favorite artist don't think download it 🌟🌟🤩",5
"In general I like the app, but if it let's you create your own play lists then it should allow you play it in the order you arranged not shuffled. Lower rating after I noticed that the majority of time I'm getting ads after every song.",2
Spotify speeches are better than other sites That's why I like it,5
"Good selection of music, but the app is basically unusable without premium. Without premium, you can only play full albums and playlists, you can't fast forward or rewind songs, you can only skip five songs in per hour, and you can't go back songs on playlists or albums. The worst part is that all of these premium features are free when using Spotify on PC and Mac.",2
Like the app but it won't let me play songs if I'm at the gym unless it's connected to a WiFi modem,3
"In the last update, I'm being with issues, in offline mode, if I'm without internet, the app doesn't let me see the download list, and if I'm already on the list doesn't let me play the music, but I'm still liking the app... But a little disappointed 😔",4
Love listening to Charlie Musselwhite and other harmonica players.,5
Love being able to listen to the songs I love!,5
Not just music. Unbelievable podcast selection.,5
"I accidently unlike a song from my liked playlist more times than i care to admit and it seems like such a trivial thing since you can just like it back right? Well yes you can but not the way i thought, it does come back but as a new song so that means straight to the top and after a while it got irritating because i got used to their old placement. My only note would be to fix this or add a feature that lets me put it back exactly where it was, it can even ask where it should go. I dont mind",5
It is the best music app I used,5
"New update sucks, I listen to mostly podcasts and it pauses randomly and does not display the rewind, fastforward,, and pause option anywhere I've seen. When I put my earbuds away it use to stop the audio but now it just starts play from my phone.",1
"There's such variety and available music that you can enjoy tremendous amounts of diversity, I love that. Old and new artists, it's wonderful. Music to relax, music to work out with, music to inspire, music to motivate! Spotify is fantastic! I like that I can share with my Husband too. I also like that wherever I utilize Spotify my playlists remain as I make them, cool...really happy with Spotify!",5
Love how every artist I listen to is on it,5
I love Spotify been a customer for years premium is worth it.,3
I've been on Spotify for 5 years. I've always loved it but now I play music for an hour and it stops playing. I either have to wait a half an hour for it to kick back in or it just doesn't kick back in and I have to change what I'm listening to. What is the problem please let me know! It's exasperating!,1
Great music selection and so easy to use,5
"Try to listen to amalee latest album. Rise of the monarch, but everytime I try and I get a play list of random songs. Some amalee but most form random different artists. After 15 attempts I still only heard 3 of 10 song out of the album.",2
Constantly opens the media controls in quick setting whenever I connect any BT device. This shouldn't even autostart let alone start playing,1
"App is not great. Service is great. Hoping the app developers start to help the user more..or will return to Apple, much better App. Details: App crashes a lot. I have premium, but when offline App won't open my downloaded music. It seems the latest update removed the pause, forward, back buttons. Overall App would get 1 star, but the overall service is worth 3.",3
Soo many irritating ads after every song it becomes soo damn irritating. Amazon music is much better !,1
Audio quality is top class. But sometimes it literally feels like I'm listening to ads in between songs!,2
"All the music I want, and more!, for a reasonable price.",5
Songs are not going in an order as I add it in favorites 😤. And the is happening. I not fixing it I will uninstall it for sure,1
The best app for listening music,5
"I love Spotify, there are times when I don't have anyone to talk to i just go to my Spotify find the perfect song with the lyrics to keep me going. 100%",5
"I download a couple of playlists for traveling, and I prefer to keep those on my SD card to free up internal storage. When I try to change the Storage location, Spotify crashes. I cannot open it, and I have to uninstall and reinstall it. This has happened a couple of times. Very frustrating.",2
Nice Ad app u got der.😵‍💫😵‍💫,1
Keeps pausing my song and wont play it all the way through. I've updated the app and I've uninstalled and redownloaded the app and still have the issue. 😠,1
Its so hard to just get one song on! And 6 skips per hour? No. This update has made it so hard to function anything! I would rate it lower if it was even possible!,1
Sucks when trying to play music in another device google asisten and play the same in my cellphone,3
"This is the second time....after I paid for premium membership, it's still not upgraded. It's been weeks now after I paid for the premium. How long do I need to wait?",1
"I tried out Spotify years ago when I got a free trial of premium from Pandora, and I have never used any other music app since. I absolutely love the ""Made for you"" section that curates songs based on what you listen to. I've found so many new songs and artists I absolutely love and I wouldn't have found them without Spotify. Just get the premium, it's 10000% worth it.",5
Good app only downside really is the ads but I've come to accept it,5
Worst app ever just go and download SoundCloud instead of this app its the worst app i have ever seen it has like a billions of ads in it and its just a weird wastes all of your time on ads rather then listening to music🎤🎼🎹🎶,1
Best music experience without advertising,5
Great app listen to music everyday on this app,5
Best music app by far,5
Very nice I give it a 10/10,5
Best collection of songs in multilanguages,5
Lots of ads but other than that it's good,5
Best app for songs 💜,5
I love Spotify!,5
"Good selection of rare albums, greatest hits Compilations and bestselling albums of the year. Highly recommended and worth sharing with everyone.",5
The app is just awesome and it gets better with premium,5
Love this app all kinds of diverse 🎶 I love to hear.,5
I love this app I can listen to my favorite songs in peace but it sucks that they add songs i hate or stop the skiping a 6 a DAY,2
I don't like this I can't unstall it and pls fix this and my fav song is not even here so I am so sorry if I made you sad(´⌒｀;),2
Good app ..good music..,5
"Great music, better price. It's free😁",5
"I feel very happy, Spotify playlist is ever before ever after",5
"Unacceptable for a paid service that is this old to have this many bugs. The now playing bar, which controls everything, has been MIA for months. Music just randomly stops playing. The buttons to pause and play just randomly stop working. The only remediation is to force stop and clear the cache. Trying to get support from Spotify is an exercise in madness. Their forums are an absolute mess and their support teams understand the application less than a casual user.",1
"It's great I haven't tried any other music podcasts apps,",4
I lesson to Spotify because it let's me pick the greatest song that it has or been looking for in years.i enjoy it very much thanks alot Spotify.,5
"Brilliant, can control it 9n mobile while gaming on pc can even turn volume up and down and don't have to pause game",5
Spotify is better but one problem I am facing is internet is on but app is showing you are off line because of this iam not hear song,1
I've had Spotify for years. Best platform for saved music and custom playlist. My fav part as a fan of sound quality. I set mine on extremely high quality for great sound especially if you play loud,4
"Spotify started off excellent, but the problem I had with App has now spread to the desktop. I can no longer play a selected song, there is no longer that icon next to the song. Was considering the premium but this problem has caused me to change my mind. And yes I have restart computer and reinstall App. Happy for those who have no issue . Hope you guys could get this fix.",1
I love just having music that I like. I can find music even if I don't know the name of the song or the artist. I can choose my playlists according to my moods. I love that I can follow small artists as well.,4
Use it on a daily basis and to be honest don't think after using it I could live without it ..music is my thing and what I use it for mostly obviously but gotta whack a few podcasts on now and again like true crime or dr.nosleep or the jack pod but best thing iv ever downloaded and won't ever have a phone without it again unless for some reason they stop the app ... Now for a 2 hour drive .. Alexa play Spotify :),5
How can u play the song without cellular data,4
When I search for a song it says you are offline.. this makes me angry!!,1
"The app is really dump, I can't make an international payment because I'm not doing it outside the country of where my credit card was issued, užkniso",1
Loving the variety of genres,5
Easy to use. Plenty of material to choose from.,5
"The volume is very low compared to the competition, even Google Assistant in Maps speaks louder. There's no EQ as well. This is from my car's head unit.",4
Great to listen to music.,5
"Terrible app. UNLESS you have premium in which case, it is the best. 3 stars because even though I have premium I still remember how I suffered without it",3
It's good and I enjoyed to listen the music.,5
"I made the switch from another service years ago and have not looked back, it was an easy transition , I find premium duo worth it so my kid and I can have our own accounts and play music at the same time",5
I enjoy it. It is the best music app ever.😊😊,5
"Why do you keep bringing up songs that I don't even listen to and doing it when I'm Not even listening to any music anywhere?? None of the other music apps that I've tried do this!! I was trying your app because I was thinking about buying it, but after this BS I don't think so!!!",1
"Fantastic app for listening to music and podcasts. My only complaint is that my downloaded podcasts don't show up offline. It may be because I don't have Premium, but the company SAYS I should be able to download and play them offline for free. Not that I'm ever offline. People who rate this app one star for the amount of ads are ridiculous. Yes, sometimes there is a 3:1 ad-song ratio, but ads are hardly ever longer than 30 seconds. Your songs are much longer than the ads you get",4
Very smooth...and recommendations are really making my playlist amazing everyday.,5
Spotify it is a very good app *****,5
Wonderful but offline music also requested,5
I love it app so nice songs 🥰🥰🥰,5
"It's not bad but not really good because it only has 6 skips an hour which is very low and you can only play song on shuffle. If I could play songs in any order I want,had more skips,it played song in my playlist not ones that aren't and it didn't have ads after 3 or 4 song,then the rating would be higher but until then it stays as a 2.",2
Excellent music allways and more.,5
"Won't show the song that's playing, or let me fast forward/rewind",1
"It's very good but... I hate the fact that I can only shuffle! Like, I can't choose the song I can listen to anymore. (Unless that's a premium thing.) Also, the music downloads don't even work for offline!",3
When I go to search option it shows internet connection not available I restarted it but it was the same . Need improvements.,4
I'm paying for an app that keeps crashing every 5 minutes! Rubbish,1
I'm on 3 months of free premium so I can't complain. And my sound taste senses have been broadened.,5
i can and will literally sit there for hours blasting my music through my headphones lol,5
Great music app it gives you all the best tracks!!😁👌🏽,5
Nice very useful during travelling Music always helps us to rewind our memories🥰,5
"Awesome!! Thank you to the creators of Spotify!! I fu ki' love it!!! You guys have introduced me to the most wicked singles and subsequent albums. Truly, emphatically, I'm virtually certain I will never require another music platform. (Perhaps the integration of artist videos would be appreciated by many of your 'loyal subjects'). Again, Dear Spotify constitutents, THANK YOU!!!!!!!",5
Just what the doctor ordered. Relaxing and soothing music.,4
"Ive always been a Spotify user but right now I am pretty sick of how it always presumes I want to listen to a playlist on shuffle!! I can start playing from the top of my playlist but it will randomly then switch to shuffle after a few songs or even just completely change what I am listening or play 'songs I'll like based on...'. Tbh its incredibly frustrating and when I then try to play the next song I wanted to listen to, Spotify pretty much crashes and I have to reopen the app!!!",2
Pathetic customer care service was waiting for 2 hrs while 6 different agents came and didn't even solve my problem.,2
Simply the best music app have ever come across with good sound system and one thing is can do something else on the phone while playing music unlike other apps🙄 which will stop playing. Awesome!,5
"Ads are annoying but it's a great free service for music fans ,Can purchase ad free at a price",4
App is not even launching on S22 after the latest update.,1
One of the weakest app I have used in my life after every song there is advertisement like come on the guy who invented this app and the way he is running the advertisement on it is a very stupid brain grow up its 2022,1
"My username pops up as my account code. My library is non existent, and nothing plays. After days of on and off trying to fix it, it still doesn't do what it used to do - what it's supposed to do. I shouldn't have had to put forth the effort for what is clearly a programming failure. I think that I can safely say that based on my experience, and many of the most recent reviews.",1
"The preview of songs is gone when I go to add more songs, it's a way that I can find songs that fits my preference",1
"There is not a good scrobling app. At least with Spotify I get what I ask for. I used to like my music from the ""box chick"" but her developers broke the scrobling algorithm. That said, the ad free version is worth the money.",4
Great choices of music!!!,4
Very bad I can't download songs even if I have premium plan,1
"It has no feature to stop it from taking over radio in your car. it is morning and your car is in Bluetooth mode. It starts playing music when you don't want anything to be playing. When you are listening to a news brief, and it ends. Spotify takes over, all want to to is think about what you just heard.",1
It's really good and all but songs sometimes get deleted and that's pretty annoying,4
"It's literally impossible to listen to the song you are searching for , very bad user experience.",1
Really bad phone app and even worse on PC/Windows. I stopped paying Spotify's ridiculously inflated premium prices and just use YT Music now...which also sucks but at least it isn't Spotify. Good riddance,1
Good but sometimes wheni use my shots xpro I can't hear the music..,5
"Absolute terrible update. When shuffle play is on i cannot go back to listening the song i played. And i can't even turn off shuffle play because it requires premium. Such a bad app i used past over the months. And when i go to a playlist, i cannot even play the songs. Worst update.",1
I can't play a specific song that I want. A different song starts everytime.,2
To to to totototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototo much of ads,1
My app updated and now every album Auto shuffles and I hate it. Give the option to turn off shuffle,2
I Love the App I rate it 4 Stars Because the songs Stop when I Watch A Video,4
Good app but quite laggy when moving the audio time.,4
"The easiest music player I have ever used....original and cleaned music and songs are there...You can create playlist as your preference and list manually....especially in laptop web version and for tablets, it's fully free but cannot download music....there are ads available but which is not much annoying...So, newcomers why are you still waiting here...just tap the install button & explore the unlimited music universe...",5
Great spotify music,5
"This app is awesome i listen triple x tentacion,BTS 💜 etc. Singers song there sound effect is amazing",5
"Hugh selection, haven't failed to find anything I don't love in the way on music",3
Good old is gold songs ❤️,5
It would be good if you could include accoutic and live concert versions more,5
The only music streaming app worth using.,5
"The app opens by itself and when I exit the app after I finish using it, it would open again and carrying on playing the song. Can you sort this issues out please",1
Nice app for🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎼🎼🎼🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧 songs never seen like this app 💕💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,5
It hasn't dropped any songs yet unlike other music apps,4
"Great experience, better than Pandora & Sirius radio!",5
4 stars cuz I can't share the song file w/ my friends,5
You are good but to pay for music it's not easy to use,5
"Better than any streaming service available, quality wise, catalogue and interface. Lately it's been a let down though, it keeps pausing mid songs. Please fix, hence the four stars rating",4
Great music app. Everything was cool until last update. Now my playlists are being interrupted by recommended songs. When l contacted support they immediately responded and their looking into the problem. Edit: Problem solved.,5
This app is nice without ads,2
One of the best application for music . Love it ♥️,5
"I love this app and I feel is the best app for music if you have an android. I get to listen to new music when it drops, listen to my favorite podcasts and much more. I recommend getting the paid version there is no ads and you get to save your Playlist and so much more.",5
From creating yoga Playlist to finding ANY song from any Era to a wide selection of interesting podcast and topics... I use spotify all the time and highly recommend to family and friends!,5
"Horrible platform for podcasts, WAY too many ads. (I pay for ""premium"") All of the mixes tend to play the same songs over and over.",1
Lots of variety of music and very good audio quality,5
It is such a great app. It has all the songs a men can imagine. It also recommends good songs,5
"When I signed up it said I was offline while I LITTERALLY had 5G, fix this please",3
"Lack of settings in webplayer for Chromebook is a bit of an issue. Also, updates often result in drop out of paired speakers & inability to play through blutooth (car, echo, etc) - when it works it's fine but can be very temperamental",2
i love it i can listen while i do other things in the tab definetly recommended it,5
I like to be able to open app and my songs be there,5
Very very nice music application. I like so much to hear songs by this app,5
It's a lovely app but mode of payment is exhausting especially for Nigeria,4
Lyrics shown by Spotify in Punjabi songs are not correct.,4
"Top quality recording. Links to albums. Words of the songs, augment the total experience. Bravo Zulu",5
Best music with out interaction by any app,5
The song quality is so amazing. I have been using this app 2 years. It has million songs to listen. Not a words to say about this. 😎,5
"- Stop getting rid of songs that are playable!!!! - I have downloaded songs and they keep saying 'unplayable' the next day - what's the point in all of this?? One of the ridiculous things of this app. - If a singer, band, or album is 'explicit' can you not just verify listeners that they are over 16 or 18 to listen???? Absolutely a joke 😡😡 - Also, why does the app always crash ubexpectedly?",3
I personally use Spotify as my first choice music player and it's good but sometimes it doesn't show to album cover for albums that I have downloaded even with a working internet connection.,3
"since the new update I can't play a single thing, I've cleared cache and everything, nothing works",1
Cool selection of music. Not enjoyable if you don't subscribe.,3
A very good sound experience. Has all types of songs in it .Really smooth app. Controls are so good. Ads are a bit too much .Ads can be reduced. Finally a nice app for music,4
"Looks like they deleted my review or something, I hate it when it's like play random song on my playlist and I can't skip it to forward or backward, that's 2. Fix it and I'll change my mind, I mean all of the user, change they're mind",1
Very annoying ads.. Ads are ok in between 2-3 songs.. But they put in between each song,1
Music is the only thinfs which console me when i feel upset so spotify helps me lot,5
"When downloaded music is on an SD card, why is spotify so unresponsive? 30 seconds to start, or change song, is not acceptable on a paid app. I will be going back to manual music downloads and using android music player, as i am always in a bad signal area",3
"1️⃣ sorting own playlists by recently added DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK 3️⃣ Search by label (e.g. label:""cyclic""), album view displays endless duplicate results 🤦 4️⃣ ERROR❗in large playlists (eg DRONE / AMBIENT / DREAMPOP 590 hours), while casting to Sonos or Chromecast, when I click on any track, it doesn't play.",2
I always have Spotify music on while gardening.,5
Bro where did the option to review the songs before adding them to you Playlist go. It's so stupid like why take it away. Not to mention the countless adds after every 2 songs,2
"I love this app, w premium is really enjoyable. The only thing I'm missing is a ""friends activity"" page, just as we have in computer devices, but in phones and tablets",4
"Please do include ""Add to playlist"" shortcut as a button.🙂",4
Good app but too much ads,3
Chill playlist is awesome,4
Worst app ever!!!!!!!!! Whenever I start the song and switch to play games the music stops............. World's worst music app ever,1
The best music streaming app available.,5
To be honest in comparison of other apps for song Spotify is best ever and forever 🙂🌼,5
"This music is one out of a million of its kind. I love it, and I'm enjoying it.",4
Listening to all my favorite songs/artists just makes me happier,5
One of the best applications I enjoy listening to podcasts and favourite songs on,5
Broken. Can't login anymore because it thinks you're offline for some reason.,1
"This is being critical. Spotify only cares about business work and profit, it was good until a year then lately nowadays am facing lot of disturbing circumstances through Spotify, it keeps playing songs out of my playlist even tho the automatic play button is off from the settings and I've seen ample of comments about the same problem being faced by people whosharing their experiences in Google and it is not getting resolved until I take their premium membership such things were not expected",3
"Finally Spotify has matured into a decent app worth paying for. A few issues remain: (1) no indicator on playlist screen to show if sequential play or shuffle play is active. Imho there should be two separate buttons, ie a standard play button and a shuffle button with suitable colour change when active. (2) should have an ""AI"" button to play more songs like this based on past listening history. (3) Need ""hey Spotify"" voice commands, especially when driving. Keep up the innovation 👍",4
"Absolutely horrible, cant even choose a song to play. Works worse than ever before and honestly literally anything else is better, even audio jungle and you hear it screaming at you half the time but it's still better than back to back ads and to fix all of the horribly stupid problems that are only on mobile mind you, you have to buy premium. Genuinely scummy and has likely resulted to lots of people abandoning a once semi-decent app. Absolutely deplorable and saddening.",1
Very good app. But always log me out when I'm traveling abroad,3
"Been using this app for many years now, cannot find many things wrong with it, it's extremely affordable for what you get and very easy to navigate and use as a whole. Highly recommended if you're looking for a consistent music app you're happy to pay for. (Just needs to suggest a wider range of recommended songs and shuffle a bit better in playlists)",5
Doesn't work on wifi for some odd reason. That's when I need it the most. Probably gonna unsubscribe.,2
"Since I started using spotify, I've experienced a unique access to music anytime.",5
"6 skips per hour without premium and the playlist functions don'teven work right, really? Talk about a cash grabbing company, the few ads were fine but now you want us to pay to skip through songs, that's ridiculous!",1
Has all the songs and bands I listen too...,5
"The new update sucks, the only way I can listen to music is in a playlist, you can't pick what time you want the song to be anymore, you have to shuffle in order to actually listen to a song, more ads, and it fills up your playlist with useless songs, worst update ever!",1
"Liar liar pants on fire. ""watch this commercial for thirty minutes of uninterrupted music"" Fifteen minutes later the music is interrupted by commercial. Every time! Choose a song, press play and it plays some other song. Every time! Notifications blocked, still shows notifications.",1
"When i first started useing this app it was all amazing but after the add free trial for new users ended it became a little worse since the add but yk I understand so i didn't mine much, but not too long ago idk what Happened something ended that made it impossible to hear music u chose, cant skip that much anymore, can put the song in a specific time or go back to the previous 1, and before i used to slide the screen in the middle to see the other song and now u can do anything without premium",1
Spotify is broken I can't play the song u wanted,1
"Its the normal spotify, nothing too wrong its just that whenever i play my songs, they will just randomly stop. Lets say im playing a game whilst listening to spotify, sometimes it will just randomly stop playing, so then i have to go back into spotify to manually unpause it",4
Premium Version is the best!,4
"All my favourite music can been played here,thanks!",5
Hate where you can't no longer see the song count.. I like to know how many songs are in my playlist.... what a silly thing to no longer have!! PLEASE FIX!!!!!!,1
Grate and lots of diffrent songs,5
"It's quite annoying sometimes because you can only skip 6 songs at a time and I can't find the song that I want . I have made my own playlist which has like 12 songs, after 5 or 6 songs it changes my playlist. It's unfair only 6 skips an hour having to wait as well as that I can't play a song I want from my playlist but I have to shuffle play. But apart from that, the quality of the songs are good.",3
"Music and play lists are great, but it doesn't respect the 30min ad free time for none premium members. It plays multiple ads back to back, however other then that it has been a good experience for me.",4
"1 star is too much for this app it should be 0 cause it's too restricting, it's very disapointing, i can't even play a song that i want. I don't like the update!!!",1
"Actually good, but getting ads more otherwise very good 👍",3
I can literally listen to my fav music artist but I don't like because your automatic on shuffle which annoys me,3
"Love it! But on the new update, you guys have removed search songs from our playists and liked songs. I would recommend to change it. Coz it was so easy finding songs by the search on our playists. Please do that.",5
Best experience while playing music But you guys should upgrade on music shuffling,4
I appreciate that your podcasts and music are open to all genres? and open to all interests?,5
"It is the best music streaming app in the world , its personalised recommending power is incomparable .",5
OK app allows easy access to lots of music and podcasts 👌 .,4
"Some issues with playing some songs here and there but overall, a great app. I've discovered so much good music to my taste in this app and I've been using it for almost 2 years now. It has helped me through so much bad times. The podcasts are also to my liking. I especially like ""Teenager Therapy"", they talk about feelings and things others are confused about. They simply explain it. Thank you so much Spotify.",5
since the update whenever I play a song it always randomly stops,2
My experience with spotify so far has been very good 👍,5
"Enjoying the daily mixes, sending so much unheard music my way",5
Best music application ever,5
Too much ads. Wrost app,1
"Honestly I'm just disappointed. I uninstalled the app a couple of days ago in order to fix the app which worked but when i logged in my account all my saved songs and playlists are all gone. What they hell!? I had over 1,749 liked songs in which i can't put them back into my playlists because it will take ages to add them back again. I thought it would save all my songs and stuff but Honestly Im just disappointed on how a account can just lose all it's stuff by just logging out.",1
"Wasn't sure I'd like Spotify, right away discovered a good selection. The Playlist are easy to make, in no time, had 3 made. One for work, one for chilling, an one for let's f-n Rock. My favorite",4
It was about to connect the music to the living rooms TV when I didn't even ask or idk how it got there.,4
"Unusable, with the constant crashes. I only came back because there's sometimes more music here then other services. It's still garbage, I really don't want to support it, since they don't care about their user base, they have questionable morals.",1
Super app in music,5
Straight away it's telling me no internet...what is it with this App. Every other App is fine just for Spotify I suddenly don't have intetnet....what a load of RUBBISH reading all the NEGATIVE reviews says to me that they DON'T CARE SO GLAD I DIDN'T PAY FOR IT UNINSTALLED AGAIN. Staying 1 star plus I'm not going to pay for premium when IT DOESN'T WORK FFS FIX IT,1
It is very good music app,5
Very good app to listen to music with all facilities and user friendly interface,5
Works well on mobile but having alot of issues on PC out of 10 songs 4 do not play,4
I add songs to my liked songs they be unliked please fix this,3
It won't let me unshuffle It's annoying and unprofessional,1
Has all of my favorite songs and its easy to use also i use spotify when i go to ohio like i did last weekend it was fun because i got use spotify but some people don know how to use spotify like my mom but to day i talt her and now she uses it when shes in the car now to,5
Uninstalling it.. Has become the worst music app recently bcz of irritating ads keeps coming after 1 or 2 songs..sometimes the ads duration would be more than 2 minutes combined of 2 or 3 ads in between songs.. #Spotify,1
It helps a lot it doesnt give you adds that much and you can turn your screen off and listen to music at the same time unlike YouTube or any other rip off app spotify is the best app ever and I recommend it😁👍,5
the app on my phone doesn't work anymore after the recent update. it says my playlists are empty and i can't play any music or podcasts at all. it works fine on my laptop though. i pay premium and i can't use the app anymore.... coooooool fun i love it >:C fix it asap,1
I try to listen to a song but it puts a different one,3
Worst app very slow loading 😡😡,1
Great app honestly but sometimes when you choose a particular song it plays a completely different song and that's quite annoying but otherwise it's great and highly reccomend,4
Premium is how you get everything you want like only Premium users get to choose a song from a playlist and skipping only 6 six songs a hour when you do Spotify you expect easy and smooth ride but nope only premium users have that make free accounts have either choose a song from a playlist or allow more skips,3
Please stop with the full screen Duo ads for premium. I'm not your target audience. Don't make me switch to YouTube Music :(,3
What is wrong with Spotify? I play a playlist and songs which aren't included in the playlist start playing. I don't want to listen to those songs. Why does Spotify ruin the mood. The playlist and blends don work fine. 1 star.,1
"So, unfortunately after their most recent update, it seems I and a few others can no longer use Spotify. I haven't been able to listen to Spotify for a good week and a half now. Every time I try to listen to my playlist, it'll just endlessly load. It's really a shame because Spotify has been my go to music app for a while now. I've tried all the recommendations to fix this, and nothing has worked. I downloaded YT Music and I'm remaking my playlist there. I may come back if the issue gets fixed.",1
Needs to have a night mode or incognito mode because my sleep music messes up my wrap at the end of the year.,4
"Any blue tooth device when commected will cause spotify to automatically open and play the most recent song you played last. No way to prevent the auto play. Needs to a addressed in the next update or you will loose subscribers. Upon doing research this is a known problem since 2015. Not sure why developers haven't fix this major issue. Only ""fix"" is to log out and log back in every time.",1
"This is best platform for listening music . But it is glitching in many devices , including mine too in which it was crashing as we play any song . Mine got fixed now but in many of the devices , this glitch is still there and hence i give 4 stars. Developers should look after this issue or else many of people will shift to other platforms like yt music , prime music , gaana etc",4
This is a very good app but there is so much ads of premium Spotify,5
"I personally love this app! The UI is good and the app itself look kinda cute. The music quality is really good. The best part is that it gives my daily mood mixes and weekly mixes too which is very accurate to the kinds of songs I listen. The discover features isn't for discovering random songs but of genres/styles you prefer. The reason to give 4 star is because of too many annoying ads. You can at least remove ads in certain playlists like ""meditation"" or ""study"" Overall it's pretty good!",4
1 star because developers refuse to fix the bluetooth autoplay feature. If the app is closed NOTHING should play... EVER! It doesn't matter If it is connected to Bluetooth or not. Amazon Music doesn't do this. Pandora doesn't do this. Only Spotify doest this. Why is that? Are your developers graduates of community college? Or maybe not graduates at all?,1
I have no words it's the best app every but sometimes it's will opt work but is super app,5
I ❤️ this app. I get to listen to different singer songs !,5
It's great...just be nice if you had more skips and could play any particular songs on Playlist as you wanted without having the premium subscription.,5
Great for discovering new artists and listening to the old ones that you know,5
Worst appl🤮🤮 I get ads after one song Please stop this app. It will be way better,1
"I love this app! I just start my tablet, start the app, select a playlist and enjoy great music for hours without having to do anything else. I don't know if there's any Greek music on here, as sometime is what I feel like listening to, but if I find some, I'll come back and add a sixth star in my comment. Edit: They do have Greek music, I found a long time ago, but I forgot I had made this commitment. They also have podcasts about anything, which I love!",5
Suddenly I can no longer use Spotify properly on the phone idk how but they suddenly ruined a good thing.,1
Good app but i cant play the songs i want to it plays random songs i never even knew about in my playlist when i choose any song it plays random songs like that.,2
Love that I can make my own personal play list!!,5
"It's kinda weird on when I was trying to listen to a long Playlist it was like ""YoU fOUnd A pReMeIUM FeatUre"" and didn't tell me what the freaking feature was. And when I clicked it again it just said it again with not even playing it. I'm going back to YouTube.",1
It's been awhile i have use this and i love this... But i gave it four star.... For some kind of issue ⚠️,4
I LOVE THIS APP YOU GET TO LISTEN WHATEVER YOU WANT so that why I give 5 star,5
My entire library just got wiped and i can't actually play anything right now. Upset :(,1
Recent update has ruined this app. Good UI and app was great before. Now music constantly stops and app crashes or doesn't load.,5
The best application to listen to music,5
High quality music for all age groups and tastes.,5
Its the best app for listening songs I really like the different album for different moods and from different countries,5
If you listen to music this app for you lol,5
"I updated the app and there is SO many ads, like 2-7 ads after every 1-3 songs, and the 30 minute free ads do NOT give a full 30 minutes, I've started to use YouTube because it surprisingly gives LESS ads then Spotify now?? I mean I can't use it in the background on my phone, but on my computer I can, so I use YouTube when I can. Also the feature where you can listen to samples of the songs when adding them to playlists is gone, WHY???",2
"Great music, can send stream to Echos, computer, TV, phone, etc",4
I love this app I listen to all my music on it but it's so annoying when the app keeps putting songs on my playlist,3
Quit changing to the damn radio every time I touch a song. If that is what I wanted then I would do that,2
Fun but hella ads,5
Best app but.. Wish I could dowload the music and hear it offline.. But alas everyone greedy :) thee non a problem,1
This app is trash it gets paused in the middle and some music advertisement comes and doesnt stop and you cannot even play the song you want to play,1
I only listen to my favorite murder for entertainment and white noise for sleeping. They are both 👍,5
Almost everything is now a premium feature you can hardly do anything but I still like listening to music with the app,3
It sometimes lags my phone severely. Sometimes it just straight up refuses to play the next song in my playlist until I open my phone and tell it to keep going.,3
"1 star because you can not just drop advertisement after every single song 😂😂😂 are we streaming song or Spotify making us watch advertisement... According to me, Spotify should pay us for watching these advertisement 😂😂",1
The shuffle play update for free user is useless now I can't play the song I want to play,1
I have enjoyed using spotify.it is fun creating liked play lists.,4
I hate how they add songs to playlist you make I would give it five stars if the remote that feature,1
"It's a very nice music app, really I enjoyed😊",5
Great app love it I can listen to songs with my phone off but Spotify adds songs to my playlist which is so annoying,3
"Day 1 Pandora user that made the switch late 2021 because of the presence, artist count, album count, etc. 2 stars is generous IMO due to the not-so-seamless integration from GalaxyWatch4 and ZFold3 hardware. Additionally, what makes me really want to drop this to 1-star is the same YouTube TV ad playing 4 times consecutively. Sure I could become a premium user, but I use Spotify for 4 hours a month at best. I won't be moving back to Pandora simply because I'm satisfied ""enough"". Is that enough?",2
Love this music app !,5
This app sucks it won't turn off shuffle,1
"This is good, but can we get a ""friends activity"" in mobile version, please, make it realtime.",2
"the app itself is kinda buggy sometimes, but good quality overall",4
I'm not using Spotify anymore cause they removed all the lyrics,1
Making your free version crappier isn't going to encourage me to give you money. It's going to encourage me to delete your worthless app.,1
This app SUCKS. When I try to play my music it never does it worse music app,1
Playlists are too repetitive and YouTube music is way better,2
Horrible. App has been broken the whole month. I want my money back for this month. Totally unusable. Edit: still garbage. Haven't changed any settings and it just keeps pausing out of nowhere.,1
Great Music App.,5
So many ads and I've had Spotify since before the pandemic it's just gotten worse most of the time also plays the songs you skip ever other day,1
"Freezing constantly and loads the wrong song selected (but never plays it) what are you, hourly?",3
Can only get 3sec version of the song if I want to save it to my Playlist have to download them from my PC to listen to the full songs,1
"Fantastic. Premium is worth the money, for sure.",5
Lots of advertisements coming past few week. Very disappointing,1
Nice but too many ads...,1
I am listening all day long as I do my yard work and great fishing buddy. I'm never board,5
Best on demand music app,5
"This app has being recommended by alot but whenever I try to create an account it's always abortive, either using email,facebook whichever way it just never works out. I just hope it's my phone and not your app package",1
"This app is absolutely amazing with the premium service. My only real complaint is that in the liked songs Playlist you can only select one genre to listen to at a time, it would be great to be able to isolate multiple genres to listen to in you liked songs.",5
"i cant play songs seprate anymore. it comes up as a playlist, and that's extreamly annoying. you cannot skip more then 6 songs per hour without premium. the only thing i really like about this app is you can play things with the screen off and stuff.",2
"I am a happy user of spotify. Less ads even when I am using the free account. Plus, I get to stream songs from BTS members. I also love playlists and podcasts and the additional short vid playback for some of the songs. The app is easy to use and very practical too ☺️☺️",5
"I'll give this a 2 stars for now, I agree with the low rated reviews. I LOVE listening music on Spotify but the problem is it's too restricted! It literally wants u to buy premium,I tried everything but nothing work! I wanted to listen 1 song ONLY but it keeps recommending me other songs that I don't wanna listen to. And I also hate that you can only skip 6 times for an hour!? Fix this problem and hoping there some improvements:/ Y'all really want mobile user's to pay money for some useless prem",2
All good but adds are more,5
The worst music app. You can't listen to what you want without so many annoying ads that are not even in the language you have your phone configured. Soundcloud is a billion times better,1
"Good app, but it's been quite annoying lately sometimes when I'm playing a game while listening to any music it randomly stops and I have to go back in to fix it, Why does it even do that? It's annoying..",4
"This is literally the most useless app ever It doesnt let me listen to my music, i can't even listen to anything i want and the ads just straight up lie to you. If i could rate negative stars, i would",1
"You sit on a throne of lies. All those ""listen to this ad and get 30 minutes of ad free listening"" is bs. I get an ad either, between 1 or 2 songs",3
I can't even listen to the songs I love and only the songs I love anymore without a whole bunch of other songs come on instead it's so aggravating and you can't even skips as many songs as you want idc abt the ads but the other parts of this new Spotify app just ruined the whole app now I can't even listen to music that I want to pls go back a update.,1
Spotify plays almost everything I can remember and that's enough,5
I do like spotify alot.. but i really dont like that i cant delete recently played list. i should have the freedom to do so if im paying for it..will be thinking of canceling account and payment.. Thanks,2
"I'm paying for this app and it's still so sucky??? Always glitching, can't see the music play bar on the app nor on my homescreen/lockscreen. No matter how many times i refresh it, update it and clear up my phone. Why am i even paying for an app that doesn't work efficiently.",2
First time downloading this app. Easy to use. Recommend highly.,4
Easy to use. Great selection,5
Great music and much more,5
"Amazing, love it!",5
Great app very cool easy to use and has every song would use 100%,5
"I just want to know how 3.5 gigs of cache builds up on an app in a few weeks, when I regularly clear each apps cache through my phones settings. Also start paying musicians more you Cnt",1
Ads are annoying.,1
Enjoy listening to this daily. Now I need to store fewer mp3 tracks on my pc and phone. Love how versatile it is,5
"It keeps playing misuc I didn't add on my playlist and won't play anything that's actually in my playlist. I can't even choose what song I want to listen to, it's like someone asking what you want but gives you something completely different anyways",1
Stop buying podcasts and making them Spotify-exclusive. The ecosystem is decentralized and independent for a reason.,1
Super music selection,5
Not got an issue really got everything im looking for only down side would be the price for multiple accounts,5
Has almost every song I search and it's a very good app,5
Lot's of advertisement.......... One song one advertisement 🥴🥲,3
Loving being introduced to music I might not have heard otherwise.,5
Sound cloud is best free also all fetures are free which are paid in it,1
Haven't worked it ourt yet but sure is OK.,3
"I love the app, it's just now I can't choose the music I want to listen to on a playlist or my liked songs, it just chooses randomly, I had it in a specificus order I liked to listen to it, and now it just chooses random, and when I go to press on the so g I want, it won't let me and it just plays a little part and it won't play the entire song, and it is really annoying. I can still listen to music, but it just chooses and it's kinda annoying I just wanna listen to my music in order not random",3
The best music choices....there is no comparison.,5
Been using this app for years now n premium has YET to fail me. Use this app daily and it never fails me. Thank you guys for such an awsome useful app,5
"Even thought some there are some out there song I can get, such a great App to lookup any genre I need and listen all day to.",5
I hate spotify with all my heart. I can't tell you how many times I have wasted an hour of my life trying to listen to one song and listen to ad after ad as I'm diverted to a song I didn't ask for. God please strike these lieing bastard down. My time is precious and I don't appreciate it being stolen.,1
"This is a okay app,it is probably the same as YouTube music or anything else. It's still nice and shows you all of you're favorite songs",3
It's good but I hate how you can't listen to one singular song and the only option is shuffle and they add to your Playlist and I hate that I only want to listen to the songs that I want and you can't do anything but listen this app is bs and you need premium to do everything,2
"If I want to unsubscribe from premium... Why do I have to open my account in web browser? App must have that functionality, that saves time and effort, improves customer experience in a few words...",3
Literally horrible I don't understand why I'm trying to listen to music and ur sitting here playing ad after ad just after one song. And it would be the same ad get a grip,1
"Way too many ads i literally once got 11 ads in a row. It's honestly ridiculous, if you dont get premium you have to sit through 2-4 ads after every 3 songs its annoying and makes the whole experience suck. I get really overestimated sometimes and I have to play music to calm down but the ads really make it so much worse, especially if the person speaking in the ad makes mouth noises. There should be a way to at least flag certain ads so you don't have to listen to them.",1
Because it kept on changing the music in my playlist it won't even play the music I chose to listen to instead plays some random other song I don't even like,1
No longer works on my phone!!!!,1
It has been very nice using Spotify till I can afford a steady subscription,5
What happened to this company used to be good I guess now it's owned facebook I just found out today that for me to watch Hulu on a big screen. I have to pay extra membership now so that is that so it's all good. I tried to call customer service for Spotify and they don't even have a phone number anymore. What's going on? Everything by owned by Facebook is like just you cannot contact them anymore. What's going? What's going on with this company?,1
Easy to use I love Spotify,5
"my life ; in my journal, written / recorded into a notebook.. with visuals, Photograhy / Newspaper Articles / clips, etc. For the Soundtracks of This, my, i, LIFETIME i have, all the years, . Thanks to SPOTIFY The PIaylists Keeps: The Music Playing.!",5
Not happy about ads but generally very happy 😊,4
Great music library with useful features. Phone app isn't as great for organizing playlists as its PC counterpart though.,4
The Android app has a lot of issues with the queue for me - deleting and rearranging things. It's very frustrating but also the developers have been very helpful and responsive (albeit so far unsuccessful) trying to solve this. I wish Spotify as a company did more to limit the spread of false information and paid artists more fairly. Overall it is still the best music streaming service I've tried.,3
It doesn't allow me to add more diverse music. It only allow some music to be available. Not very much to download.,3
It good there also ksi music is good as well,5
Awesome music app easy to use recommned it to everyone,5
"Great product. The algorithms are pretty spot on, I suspect because there are smart people monitoring and revising them constantly based on continuous feedback data from users.",4
"Will not stop, stopping while I'm trying to listen to music and playing a game with no sound on.",2
"So far, so good! Listening to music that I like with no problems at all.",5
"Player keeps disappearing! 😡😡😡 the only thing that works is force closing the app which is not acceptable. I pay for this, fix it or give me a discount or I'm canceling",1
Owh very nice to this apps because all your music is already her.,5
I love the music personally my favorite music app,5
Its like it knows me! Love it!!!,5
Honestly if Joe Rogan wasn't on here i would have you tube music but i have to say I've gotten pretty spoiled on the user interface pretty easy 5 stars,5
"4 stars for now, 5th one will be there when I can find the option to play songs from device which aren't available on Spotify. Otherwise, a good overall experience",5
"With this app, I can listen to music without interruption",5
My recently listened to section had disappeared and plus half of my homepage is ads for podcasts that I couldn't care less about even though I've never listened to a podcast on Spotify before. This app keeps getting worse with each new update.,1
"Apparently I'm not the only one with this issue but when I go to another app it will stop playing music, even though I pay for premium. Or it won't show what's being played when I'm in the app. Please fix this it's been doing this since the update and it's really annoying I'm considering changing services. IM GETTING SO TIRED OF HAVING TO CLICK PLAY BECAUSE IT KEEPS PAUSING ITS SELF WHEN YALL GONNA FIX THIS",1
"I re-downloaded the app because I liked it better than any other music app, but every Playlist is empty and none of the podcasts work. I have premium and I checked, all of the other apps on my phone work and I have a strong data connection so I don't understand what is wrong. I'd really hate to delete my account again.",1
Music is awesome!! Joe Rogan podcast is the only reason I downloaded this app because you sponsor him and he is my dad,5
"You don't need any other music app , this app does it all",5
"Idk what are people on. Awesome app as always. Just pay 5 bucks or just stay quiet. Five bucks is nothing and by paying it, every door opens up. And no, there are no adds on Spotify Premium. Never was.",5
good app but the ads are to long,3
"The worst piece of software I've ever used from the more mainstream ones. Doesn't work properly on desktop, doesn't work properly on Android. Just pathetic.",1
Love the music! Just getting started in Spotify.,5
Recently updated version forcing me to remove this file from my phone. Thanks Spotify Bye Bye,1
Good but many ads,3
You guys need to fix this app. The version that goes on the phone works fine but the version that goes on my TV SUCKS I've never been able to watch a whole episode of anything on it you have to log out and go back to the TV main menu and go back into the app at least once every 45 minutes.,3
For some reason I can't listen to the music that I downloaded for some reason,2
"I HATE the new update I can't listen to the music I want in my playlist I like the song but I just don't feel like listening to it right now, and then I skip and skip so I can get to the song I want the new update is annoying and absolutely useless I hope they fix this.",3
I was listening to one musician and the app started playing other music and I couldn't change it or pass. Not impressed.,1
"Had to go back to Spotify Free because Premium was a luxury I can't afford. Being poor is punishment enough without being taunted by awful features of this app. One album I love I haven't heard in entirety for weeks, as if some songs just aren't available. It shuffles in other artists, and plays songs already set to hidden, then the playlist stops before actual completion and I'm expected to start over with songs I've already listened to? Borderline fascism. Spotify are bullies.",1
A great music service.,5
"When you dont have premium you get limited skips, you cant put a song on loop, you cant pick a song, and its only on shuffle. I use music to work on writing, art and other things, but with the fact that I cant pick my music without premium I find it difficult to actually focuse because I cant pick the song I need to suit the mood I have. And with having three to four ads in a row it messes with my anxiety. And with the new update, my music stops mid song. Spotify is just getting worse.",1
"-Sometimes when I switch device phone, computer or TV when I change song I can't played it and it jump to another song or app just freeze then crash. Sometimes for no reason I just got disconnected anf need to log in when I do I have message no Internet connexion so can't log in I have to clean cache for the app, uninstall and install it and log in again. Sometimes all my playlist are gone temporarily and all download playlist offline were gone so I have to downloades it again.",4
It was working fine but now nothing is working I can't play anything,2
I can't download over wifi unless I select to allow download over data.,1
Have been more than a satisfied customer now for over 8 years. Thanks Spotify,5
"I use to like spotify until this new update, whatever this new update is it stoped me from picking the song i wanted to listen to because spitify ruined my playlist. It now shows a preview of the song i want to listen to and they removed the queue for songs. The only way i can use my playlist now is if i connect to my console or tv.",2
It's amazing I like the music and the videos,5
Tbh this app is insanely overated because whenever I try to play something it plays something else completely different and I cannot change it and without the premium subscription you can only skip 6 musics per hour 😐,1
Best music streaming out there,5
"Love this app! I like all types of music and Spotify is the perfect solution to meet my needs. I love being able to make a playlist of my favorites, but Spotify also helps me find new artist to listen to.",5
Best music app out here. Thank you spotify for making my life better.,5
Spotify is the BEST!!! If you don't have premium then you have limited options but when you get premium it is amazing. You can download and listen offline and play songs individually.,5
Love the app it's quite efficient you can play all kinds of songs,5
I get listen to music while I'm using anther app,5
"They have go a great length at making the free version so terrible, horrible, unenjoyable experience.",1
"I dont mind commercials, but when I hear the same YouTube commercial three times in a row every ten minutes, it makes me want to go back to Pandora.",3
"Great app! I can play anything I want, I've looked up songs that are really old and I've played them all and I just love Spotify.",5
I rlly do love it but can you pls add slowed music to it when i found out it doesent have slow music it really messee up my vibe.,5
Total changed from good to worst😭💔 i even cant play my playlist youtube music is now even better,1
I haven't had a better experience with streaming apps than Spotify!,5
It could be much better. Will randomly stop playing. Occasionally still recieve ads although I pay for premium. I'm not even mad just disappointed at the wasted potential. Get it together spotify.,1
"Outstanding vin YOUR field.... dev team esp EVA group,? ALL folded when our group of beauties showed up. But took til now to get all the shelves cleared of scratchy wax. Thanks for keeping dabwaves humming",5
Great place to get nice music,5
I used to love this app for finding music for my videos or just to listen to for free but now when I click on a song it plays a whole different song and plays LITERALLY ALL SONGS for half the song then goes to the next song :/ I hate this app I can probably find a better app for music and music for my videos I'm never installing this app again and I DONT suggest this app,2
"Harder to use each update. uses a ton of data, but wont work correctly in offline mode. Good luck listening to podcasts. Not user friendly any more, used to be great. Randomly shuffles. Have had premium for about 6 years now, starting to rethink, not worth 9.99 a month. If you only listen to music on shuffle on WIFI, this is the app for you.",2
Best music app around.,5
Stops after about 30 seconds everytime I want to play somthing in the background,3
Sending ads every few seconds,1
"App breaks constantly, crashes, will be ""playing"" and no sound, or press play and nothing happens. Repeatedly having to close and restart the app to get some funtionality out of it. Hot trash",1
The best of all the music streaming apps,5
Love this app! Better than audiomack,5
"sorting podcast library by ""recently updated"" now is useless because it stopped showing the DATES they were updated! USELESS! it's a small detail, but if it ain't broke, don't ""fix"" it!",1
"Great app, I love when I play my favorite album from Dynamo Y13 it plays all the songs back to back",5
I find the app quite pleasent. It has nice music and it gives you songs you might like according to the previous songs you have listened to.,5
Love this app. The search features have improved over the years. Being able to Shazam a song and open it in Spotify is awesome!,5
Great app for music,4
I do not like how you add your own music to the ones I add to my liked music then I have to skipp threw then to get to mine,1
You can download songs that you like 😘😍😍💖💖❤️❤️,5
Even if you put a 1000 ads I will not buy premium because I can't 🙃,1
"from last week it doesnt show the hindi lyrics for the song,it shows hindi words in english,pls solve that if you know what I mean and also english lyrics has so many spelling mistakes.",3
Easy search and complete list of artists.,3
"Amazing, easily the best UI and music app in general I've seen anywhere.",5
I just love the play list of aongs and audio quality 5/5,5
"Great app, however it was recently bombarded with ads. Also it should be able to loop podcasts.",4
Love the variety of music offered and the ease of finding it on they app,5
"My spotify hasn't worked in a week. I unloaded it,reload it uninstalled it three times and it doesn't work.",1
Best music platform,4
Always on time! Very consistent product!,5
The Most Beautiful Experience As Far As Music Is Concerned! Loving Every Minute Of My SPOTIFY-ing!,5
"New review- I would give less than one star because it was already on 1. The update I made today is now not allowing the app to play songs in a consecutive order if there is no shuffle on. Also when I want to play a song it instead plays something entirely different that's not even in my playlist! The app keeps stopping, it just pauses the sound and I can't make it start again unless I force close the app and open it again. Rubbish",1
Very good aap whichever I hope to play my favorite song this aap fulfill my desire Thank you very much spotify,5
This is a great app for streaming music but sadly I don't have premium yet,5
"Easy to use, song quality excellent",5
Nice can play my fav songs,5
Samsung S21 Ultra. South Africa. Shuffle keeps turning on.,5
It was great until I had to play an entire Playlist to play ONE SONG!,1
"Disappointing. I turned offline mode on as usual when I purchase a premium, at first it allows me to play my downloaded songs but now I can't even play any song and the offline button is gone. I can't turned it back off, better fix this problems or you will lose all of your users.",1
I really love Spotify it's ossum My heart too Spotify 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜,5
best app for listening songs,5
TOOOOOOOOO MUCH ADS.,1
"Glitchy and unacceptable. My Spotify has always been glitchy, closes at random, skips multiple songs, switched out of the playlist to a random one however now it's beyond bad. The play bar disappears constantly for days on end. This means I can't skip, pause add songs to playlist, pause podcasts, ect. I think this is absolutely unacceptable for a paid app. Yes I've force stopped the app, deleted and re download it.",1
Easy to navigate,5
App is generally good but occasionally slow and buggy. I also have troubles occasionally with controlling songs playing and playlists when casting to an external device.,4
Ads are annoying,3
Too many ads on podcasts with Spotify premium.,3
I Love This App Because I find All Songs.. I wish you continued success💝,5
"It's OK. Has a lot of underground bands I like. App crashes frequently, often will hang on loading my downloads page before erroring out saying there's no internet (I download podcasts/music BECAUSE I don't want to use data) Also likes to change songs from what I was listening to to a completely different song when I get into my car",3
"I'm using this aap last one year and I have good experience with this aap. I used to like that the ads were not much, an ad used to come in 20 30 minutes. That's why, I used to recommend my friends to download this application. But for a few months, ads come twice every 10 15 minutes. Now I don't like it. I think that the ads should be reduced a bit, it is necessary to take some attention to spotify.",3
"When ever you are serious and wanna listen sad song then the add comes, 1 song = 4 adds.",1
Let me listen to my own damn songs not some suggested songs.,1
Better than other music apps I have tried,4
Terrible app that magically works if you pay for premium.,1
"Spotify is nice and I have my favorite playlists on there. However, the ads can get unbearable and I used to be able to pick my songs without premium. And now I can't anymore, please Spotify don't make that just a premium thing. I can deal with ads but I hate having to listen to a song because I only have 6 skips. I like being able to pick the songs I'm in the mood for.",3
"It used to be amazing but now nothing ever loads whenever I click on my likes, artist, Playlist, etc. I thought it was my phone but its still happening.",3
"i love this app, but its not good without premium bc with premium you can skip unlimited songs but without you only can skip 6 per hour 5$ is not much if you wanna have no adds and unlimited skips😁",5
Brilliant. All my music in 1 place all the time with me... what more do you want....,5
Best app for songs....,5
"Garbage. Spotify sucks at playing music. Several years paying for this app and it still has no idea what music I enjoy. If I ask my Google home to play a specific song off of spotify, it won't do it most of the time. Unacceptable for a paid service.",1
I have issues while using on android music randomly stops and evertime it asks me to allow background play there's not option for it so I'm constantly having to turn my phone on to keep the music playing,3
There so ad and makes me anger cause whenever my mood to listen song but whenever ad start play its very annoying after ad i really not want open Spotify plz we don't need any ads it's so annoying,3
Nice app I use this every day 💜 no ads no bufferings..... ✨ songs in all languages are available 🤘 I love this app so much💙✨,5
"After listening 2 songs, like 6 ads appear and it repeats over and over again, Spotify chill with the ads",3
"plays music, has good algorithms",5
"Best music app that i know of, but sometimes it gives me short clips thst are shorter than preview clips on my samsung(s). Or Prehaps, there is a setting that i overlooked.. Spotify is the fiurst music app that i've emgareed, Kind of easy to move around. Keep it up!!!",5
After every song there are two ads and you know that I am not listening to songs I am listening to ads what they say,5
"I have recharged for 7 days premium, but I can't able to connect and listen with other premium members,Repeatedly showing only eligible for premium members.",1
No ads and all kinds of content,5
i have been thinking of getting premium but even if you dont its still an amaszing expeiriance,5
Best Music App Ever..,5
Best platform for Best old songs I like it.,5
"It worked well all this time, but recently the just app crashes.",1
"Would be better if my freaking notification area wasn't always bugged. Seriously sick of it. That and I don't get half my podcasts showing a lot of the time until I reset the app 100 times, noticed it's the Daily Wire pods especially. Yep, and again today, was listening to a podcast that's mysteriously disappeared again of course it's a conservative one. Will be canceling if this keeps up",3
"The control you have over your music is crazy, and for the low low price of free 99",5
I can't see lyrics of any of the song,4
I give it 4.5 stars It should let u rewind song and pick what u want to hear by choice . Not follow the order,4
"If you hear music while gaming,this is the best choice for you",5
The fact that those in premium can't download music to their hard drive is a bit unfair. Also at this point spotify should have dolby capability,4
Good app for hearing music but we cant bosst volume in spotify....... It was there but updating the options in the playback removed please add that option again ....,3
Songs and lyrics are available at all times. Listening to music by all songs available in shuffle mode.,5
i opened a discover taylor swift thing and now it broke the app. i'm reinstalling but if it's broken you're gonna get a real angry phone call soon!,1
"Need to fix the stupid app, it's so annoying to have to listen to 3 ads then only get to listen to 2 songs before u get more ads",1
Wow can't even turn off the shuffle mode I just wanna listen to my favourite songs and I need to pay for it?,1
I really enjoy the product. So healthy and encouraging.,4
Refusing to recognize play lists. Now using browser version until fixed 😒,1
Love this app until I can't play the songs I want anymore it's on shuffle and it adds songs to my Playlist. I guess I'm back looking for an app I can listen to what I want when I want! I'm so Uninstalling this app I'm so disappointed!,3
It's a nice app with background play and it's easy to make playlists and all..but I'd recommend it that you add the clear history option back and make it so that you know which song is gonna play next. It's a good app overall,4
"Probably the best music streaming app available at the moment. Interface is dated, though. This is where Apple Music triumphs Spotify.",4
Surprisingly glitchy with user irritations that exist for an app that's been in existence for so long. A better alternative would be a welcomed change.,3
Best collection of music!!!,5
It's better to listen on spotify rather downloading song,5
Sorry to say but it gives too much adds.. the more good is the music and the more is the no. Of adds . Btw I love it!! Just fix the no. Of adds...!!!,2
Just love using this app this is awesome 🔥,5
"the pictures and the frames of the albums and playlists covers have lost quality and the high definition that had previously and itʼs blurred and horrible, and has been this way for almost a month now. please, FIX THISSSSS",1
Really great way to enjoy music,5
Great and enjoyable music.,5
"Its astounding how everytime i load up this app, something is wrong with it. Just now I tried favoriting a new album to my library, it says it saved, but it's not there when i try to open it. I try playing any kind of music? It gives me an ad that says its 10 seconds long and then gets stuck on that ad for 2 minutes!! Of dead air!! This is why i dont ever want to try premium either.",1
Sucks. Plays 5 seconds on my android and stops.,1
"I have loved Spotify since I got it, the premium version is incredible and pretty cheep. Algorithm is pretty good most of the time, but when it isn't pretty good it is absolutely terrible, that's the only thing that brings this down! Great app for music lovers",4
"itself, the application is good for listening to music, but it does not play the song you requested, they play the artist but another one of their hits and the one you want to hear they don't play. you make your playlist and right away they add about 50 more songs because according to them it's your style and you're going to like it! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️",1
"Spotify has every song I have ever looked for, including Shazam songs from television shows I watch. The playlists they create for me have gotten me through the brightest and darkest days in my life for over a year. Music heals and Spotify has a song for everything. Thank you.",5
I wanted to listen to ONE SONG. Just a SINGLE song. App won't let me. Every time I click on the song it plays literally anything else. Can't find the song out anywhere else yet or I'd go anywhere else to listen to it.,1
I enjoy the music between all the ads I get. Great app for listening to ads and breaking it up with a song every now and then. Oh did that new album just drop? Here's a bunch of unrelated songs and the album is out of order.,1
I try abd try to play my liked song but it let me like there giving me songs that i don't want to lisen to that are not eveb on my liked and i press the shuffel liked song so it can play at least one of my liked song but ut stikl dosn't play my liked and if i try cliking on the song it jest gives me a prevu i liked the old spotify betty this us jest not if overall it sucks,1
"Cant search even when online cos it days ""Go online to search again"" even when it is playing songs. Very frustrating experience. So frustrating i even use youtube misic now",1
Great music app. Easy to use,5
this app is getting worse. now it won't keep my liked songs downloaded so I have to go on data constantly to listen to my music at work. I've been paying for premium for years to not have to deal with things like this and it's so frustrating,1
Cannot get to stop playing in the background. Canceling and uninstalling,1
It won't let me play my music only there stupid suggested songs that I don't ever like FIX THIS,2
"Glitchy as hell. I install this to listen to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast and Glitched like crazy, crashed on me and when I went back to the episode I was listening to it just started back from the beginning even though I was already halfway through. Uninstalled immediately after that, too bad.",1
"To quote an ad from Spotify itself, ""easy to use, highly colaborative, works on any device.."" Love ittt!!!!!",5
"My Episodes Folder makes this app useless offline. Every podcast I download is added to My Episode Folder, it happens automatically and it's much harder to remove than how it's added and undownloading an episode doesn't remove it. When offline I to go to downloaded podcasts in my library, but that just brings me to the My Episodes Folder, which won't load because there are undownloaded episodes in it. I can not access my downloaded episodes offline, so why have the app and pay for premium?",1
"This is the worst app for podcasting, awful at downloading, awful at offline listening. Awful for podcasts. Always sucks at downloading, never stays where I left off. The offline mode sucks. Skipping through ads starts the episode back over. Wish Rogan never made a deal with you guys. Never have an issue with Google podcasts Update 2022, still the worst podcast app I have to use. Wouldn't use it if it wasn't for Rogan",1
They have EVERY thing and I mean EVERY thing! LITERALLY EVERY thing! And I'm still discovering and re-discovering EVERY thing!!!!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼,5
I get what I want when I want it. Outstanding!,5
"I've used this app for 10 years. To say that I cannot live without Spotify is an understatement. It's so cheap as well to listen to unlimited music and podcasts. If you a willing to invest a small amount on a monthly basis, I guarentee you won't regret your experience with Spotify.",5
Nice but spotify can you keep edit the playlist option. If you need to add song by our own sequence. Please it is an request to spotify. Otherwise this app is very nice and I like the ready-made playlist.,4
I love to be give 4 coz Spotify is using simple but when advertising Start I hate the app most,4
"The only thing I don't like is there is no way to replay as song you like, you can skip songs but you cannot go back to one of you want to share it or get three title and artist. Everything else here is work it, even on the free aspect.",5
Offline mode doesn't work and when my phone turns off and back on I can't go on spotify at all and I have to delete ALL of my downloads every god damn time even though this is premium... Jesus just fix your app.,1
why nowadays i'm not able to search song..When i click one song automatically another song gets play.,3
Great music with no ads,4
Spotify is a amazing app for music and podcasts and I really like how it has all songs like pop rock all sorts of music.,5
Worst worst app i hate this app a lot of ads making me irritating and not at all giving pleasant music with this stupid ads and subscription is highly cost and i feel so bad about it 😡😡😡😡,1
Good but there should be less ads but good,5
Just enjoy the music and appreciate the free plays,4
Very inconsistent connections too many commercials.,1
"I like it but, it missing the ""song"" feature.",4
"Simple to use, happy I added this happy!",4
"Overall it is a great app for podcasts with copious amounts of content but problematic on my Chromebook. I have problems several times a day where it stops showing me what is playing in the left side panel, preventing me from interacting with the podcast in any way. The only way I can fix it is to go into settings and completely delete the app's storage then log back in. This of course wipes out anything I have downloaded. Unfortunate but prevents me from using the app as much as I would like.",3
"Awesome I like this music app I really enjoy music in very high quality but some movies missing like rakshak, itihaas, mrityudaata, tere mere sapne, diljale etc",5
"The reason a fee paying customer does not recieve ""lyrics"" when they're actually paying good money for the favility, is because hhe failt is at Spotify. Customer's shouldn't need to uninstall and reinstall and fanny around with their phones and trying all other manner of fixes. The fault is at Spotify not on thousands of people's phones like the stupid fixes posted on YouTube and a thousand other places suggest.",1
"Had a 160 hour playlist before I got a free trial of premium, wasn't able to afford to pay for premium, so my playlist got cut down to 32 hours and I'm not a happy camper.",1
The enhanced feature on playlists singlehandedly makes spotify the hands-down only music app choice,5
Amazing the best song app ever,5
It is a very great app for listening music and you can create playlists select different artists that you like and listen to their playlists or you can search the song and listen to it,5
Best Apps for songs lovers..,4
Spotify is the best music app in the world,5
Excellent for recommendations! Has exposed me to many different bands that I didn't even know existed :),5
I love listening to Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias but the only have it in Spanish no matter what you select. It sucks.,1
"Good app, but it is glitchy in the car and doesn't start playing automatically and randomly stops after a song. Also for no reason it stops you from liking songs. To fix it you have delete it and reinstall it. This has happened since I got it and it should be fixed.",4
"Garbage. I just want to listen to the song that I want to listen to. Why is that so difficult? And I shouldn't have to watch a 60 second ad for it either. Then it gives me random songs from the same artist. I skip 6 times and it's locked. Screw it, I'll use YouTube.",1
"I love your music platform, It brings an amazing experience and excitement to life. Thank you sincerely Mr.Wilson",5
everytime I restart my phone the cover of my playlist change and it always crashes.,2
Updated: had to update to one star after I get an ad after every song! Old review: The app works greatbut no way to skip the ads especially when they are all unrelated and untargeted. Why the hell would I care about mental health and all that jazz for snowflakes? They just spam you to death with unrelated stuff. I never got one targeted ad in my years of use...,1
"The last couple of months it has been very glitchy. Every single time I open the app, it says it has updated exactly 49 songs and the app will then stop and cannot download this mysterious last, 50th song. I have to restart my phone. Absolutely painful. Also music playing but no currently playing displaying on the screen, have to go into the app each time. Randomly shuts itself down too. The share function hasn't been working either. Unacceptable for premium subscription. Sort yourselves out",1
"Very nice app , but too much ads",4
I'm from Louisiana and Spotify has everything I love all Louisiana hip hop,5
Easy and versatile,5
"Very bad developer's , after opening app network error is common 😑",1
"I love this app I can hear to bts songs🎧🎵, hurray! And this is jst awesome for all, but especially for armys 💜💜💜🥰❤",5
Terrible if you commute on an underground subway. The UI and your library of downloaded and locally stored music cannot be played unless you manually switch the app into offline mode. The app should gracefully handle periodic outage of wifi/wireless connectivity and still function. Will likely be cancelling my subscription for this reason as Spotify is how I listen to music on my commute.,2
"I love the app and its function works smoothly for which they deserve 5 stars but I can't access Spotify podcast in Pakistan, therfore, I am giving 3 stars.",3
Too many advertisements,3
"I'm especially thrilled that I can run other applications simultaneously with Spotify on my phone. Minimise, listen to music and carry on with everything else!",5
The only problem is that I can't download it or play music without data.But I love it ❤️💖💖💖💖💖,5
"For music, it is the best app but for podcast google podcast is the best for me. You should learn from them.",4
Experience is absolutely great best music app ever,4
"In my liked songs it doesn't allow me to play a song I wish to so I have to play it on shuffle and to add to that it only allows me to skip 6 times in an hr, doesn't let me add songs to queue or even see what song is next. This is all after the newest update which is honesty horrible because I do not wish to pay premium for features that should be available for everyone. Honestly speaking majority of music apps don't have such a thing and it's disappointing on Spotifys side to even think of this",1
"Frequently pauses and plays again for no reason about every minute, until it finally stops playing. Just started happening in the last week. Makes listening very frustrating. Glitchiest app I have every used.",1
Excellent music app one of the best,5
"GREAT I love this app, old and new music. I can access via my phone, car and TV. I live for music so it is great. I pay a reasonable monthy fee to remove ads. The only bug bear is I download music for the car, and they sometimes it says I need to re download for no apparent reason which means if I am out and about I can't do. Also great for playlists and suggesting similar liked music.",4
"This app was all good. I enjoyed listening to my favourite music, but all of the sudden when i try play any song it takes me to a complete different song. I cant ever play the songs i enjoy listening to because of this. If there is any way of fixing this, please get it fixed because i miss listening to my favourite songs without going onto YouTube because spotify wont let me play my songs.",1
Love all my playlist that Spotify creates for me!,5
Love app but hate lossing all my songs when i cant aford premium should just lock em or not let u get more not make u start over had 3000+ songs in library an alot of it was new people names idk so cant find alot. So pay or kinda sucks an make youtube easyer its free to have a library an never erased or this would be 5* app,3
"Changed my 1 star to 5. Not even going to explain why, but just use Spotify as best music streaming service available.",5
"The app is old garbage. Offline mode deletes daily playlist, daily freezes, you can't share a song without the app breaking once. It's just bad. Spotify is outdated as an app an same goes for the desktop application. Edit: I got my like playlist with 1500 songs. Spotify plays 20 of these if I press random. Still broken.",1
"Why are Singles and ep's shown as albums under Your Library Also, it would be nice if we could see liked song in albums, like it is with playlists",4
I don't have much to say Just that it's everything i wanted from the app,5
Best songs app ever. Except the ads....,5
"Really awful experience. Keeps shuffling songs and forcing me to listen to random things. I search up one song and click on it, and it plays other songs. I tried going back in the playlist, and that's not possible for some reason. This app is surprisingly bad.",1
"Just joined up, so far so good, just trying to work my way around it, atm",4
"Most of the songs from any genre are available. Like it. And, easy to use.",5
"Best free music app, simply put",5
It works just fine but I don't like how there's no search on home screen 😠💗,4
Good selection but has a recent tendency to be glitchy.,4
"Everything I'm looking for and more, love it",5
"I am not able to login to my account from my phone. I tried it more than 20 times. And now when i open it, it is showing only the logo.",1
"I LOVE THIS APP.BEST MUSIC APP EVER. IT'S ALMOST LIKE ALL ROUNDER , BUT I WISH I HAD AN OPTION TO DELETE HISTORY AND THAT TO SINGLE (I MEAN RECENTLY PLAYED PODCAST, SONGS, EPISODES ETC) CAN U PLS ADD THIS FEATURE.. 😟😥 AND ALSO THERE ARE MANY SONGS (ESPECIALLY BTS SONGS) THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE. SO PLS CLEAR THIS MATTER, CUZ I THINK MOST OF ARMYS INCLUDING ME WANT THOSE SONGS.. AND CAN U PLSS PUT KOREAN-ENGLISH AND KOREAN TRANSATION PLSSS",4
I was satisfied from Spotify in the starting but now I am just fed up of never ending ads for premium. In the starting there was only one ad and now they are just increasing,2
Breaking Points is the best show in Spotify.,5
It's all I use to listen to music and podcasts,5
Comprehensive content & professional delivery.,5
They charged my card without my permission I didn't sign up for premium,1
Best app which helped me to upgrade my life quality. Helped me through lot of hard times!,5
"I've had money in my acc for spotify for aver a week. Spotify never took it's money, and netflix did. So now i dont have money for this.",1
Love Spotify so much I have premium and it works so well keep up the new content,5
"Just about every song you could want is here. Easy to use, and I really like that Spotify alerts me when my favorite artists have new music.",5
The app is absolutely amazing and it's a 10/10 for me.,5
If you don't have Spotify premium then the adsssss are like more than the songs in play list basically it's a paid app only.,1
"Edit: Since they brought back car mode I've raised my rating to 4 stars but there's still some weird bugs like being unable to access my playlists but music still plays and everything on the home page is fine. Old: So, let me get this straight, you removed the perfectly fine car mode - which despite the name actually had plenty of uses outside of a car - and replaced it with a mode that can only be used with the ""car thing"" - which is currently only available in the USA and costs a cool $80???",4
Thanks Spotify keep it up best app,5
What the hack Spotify?! Why I can only invite family member to my account living on the same address!? Why the hell I would need so many devices on one address?! What a stupid decision to change the policy,2
This app is so bad don't download. If u play your favriout song it will start an anthoer song. Don't download,1
GIVE THE OPTION TO DISABLE THE VOLUME SYNC WITH SPOTIFY CONNECT FOR CHRIST SAKE!!! I have multiple Connect devices and I don't want them locked together at the same volume. THIS IS A BIG ISSUE THAT IS AN EASY FIX FOR YOU!! Listen to your (paying) users because a quick Google search shows this is a common issue. 5 stars if this petty issue is fixed.,2
it takes too long to download an album and I'm using a good wifi please fix this then it's goan be a deff 5 star and can u make the download animation like that of apple at least.,1
"Great music, very clear. No b.s.",5
"Crashes constantly, very often plays the sound but doesn't show the player screen, so you can't pause or skip. Often while just listening the whole app just crashes. Integration with Alexa used to be great, now it's hopeless. 9 times out of 10 it doesn't do what you want it to.",1
It is a very excellent app it has a option make your own album I like this option very much. it has all kind songs and lyrics. yeah it's a good thing excellent but sometimes it's logout itself please do something about it that's why I am rating it 4 star,4
Aren't 3 ads after every 2 tracks too much ???,1
"Good streaming service, however the lack of lossless audio in 2022 is inexcusable",3
Absolutely crazy amazing. Spotify primume really makes the change.,5
"So far, very impressed with the app.",5
Nice app for song lovers I personally love this app,5
Great sound great selection,5
"Spotify tells that it gives 30 mins of ad free music but it gives ad after every 6-7 mins. And now it contains sexual content too. Idk what are sexual audios doing in a music ap. It's disturbing when such cheap content pops up on the screen while searching for my fav songs. Your ads are very irritating I swear. I know they are made to sound irritating, I swear the voices get to my nerves so much.",3
Its autoplay is off yet playing as autoplay.,1
"Usually great but recently the app has been bugging quite badly - I'll pause the music to do something outside of the app, and when I go back the control bar has vanished so I can't play, skip etc. Still have the bar in notifs but that stops syncing with what's playing so barely useful and even closing all, reopening the app & picking new song doesn't fix it, just now I don't even have notifs bar to control it. Really ruins the usability.",3
"Always love using Spotify, nice to get new playlists made for urself weekly to discover new music, can't live without music. ☺️🎵🎧",5
This is very nice app In this app there is no add like other music add Please try it,5
You dont have control over the songs you want to hear and that's supid,1
Marvelous Spotify is the best,5
"Unfortunately 0 cannot be given. Spotify, both the app & web is the most unusable and unintuitive user interface ever created. Shame :(",1
Yesterday when I clicked on a song suddenly 6 ads continued please fix it. A suggestion is that please add Google Play purchasing option for paying from Google Play balance because I have money in Google Play Balance. Please hear my request.,5
Too many adds...😡😡 I'm so irritated.,1
Can't play songs in order i want to. In order to do so i need to pay. And after updating today i now can't see my liked songs as they won't load.,2
Woww spotify is so beautiful you can see all internal musical song in spotify app so you download now 😇,5
"Always asking for premium so many ads, youtube music is better",1
"Very good collection, hope to hear more good music.",5
"Every time I click a song, spotify will stop all music for 15 seconds before it starts playing the song",1
"This app really sucks! I don't know what happened but last week, I've been getting these bugs like my liked songs are only playing in 10 seconds and when you exit from the app, it will stop. Also, I can't play my normal playlists without playing it in the shuffle button. This frustrates me.",1
"Since I updated the application, the lyrics disappeared What happens...",5
"Thank you very much, it is good sound quality.",4
Excellent app. Music to suit everyone and every mood or event. Love it.,5
"I say it honestly a amazing app, because I love the fact that you can create your own playlist.",5
Downloaded this app mainly because was a fan of Joe Rogan's podcast. . And at some point yall made the videos unavailable,1
"This app is good, but sometimes when I play my favorite song in my playlist, the different song was played, but it's good listening to the song using this app.",4
The update made adding songs to a playlist difficult .,1
The best aap but music is not play some times,4
Has everything you need on the app when comes to music app,5
"Ads are good , but ads get interrupted by songs sometimes ☕",4
love the music BUT it's horrible that you can't delete the search history of all time. Once I heard something it will always show up again if I search for something similar. Please change this!! this can't be a thing for such an amazing app.,3
The best music platform in the world,5
I like it cause it has some of the songs I like however the fact that they only come in Playlists so I can't just listen to my song I picked kinda pisses me off,2
To much ads.,1
1 star for this app because I just wanna PLAY MY FAVORITE SONG IT JUST PLAYS ANOTHER AD Fix it and I'll put it into 5 stars and it's so annoying,1
Good app. But istfg why Does it shoes no internet connection when my mobile data is working fine the app literally just works fine with wifi fix this it's low-key annoying,3
"Awesome app, i like adds. Its very beautiful to here. Especially zomato add.",5
Full ads iam not inresting,1
Just love love this app my speaker is on all the time 5 star,5
My experience with this app has been good so far. You not only play your favourite songs but the app also recommends songs you can listen to based on your song listening history.,4
This app turned to good to a ea app Need Premium for no shuffle play,1
It's a very good app just that I can't pay for premium because I'm using a verve card. I hope that will be rectified soon,3
Excellent app to listen to music. And it is the best one out there.,5
The only music player I will ever use,5
Very happy with this App. Lovely songs and podcasts. Thank you do much.,5
I love this app! It's one of my favourites!,5
"5 stars 🤩 to you, really this app make me full day in happily mood When I play a song and they play related song no need to search 😍❤️🥰",5
"Hello Spotify team! I am recently having a problem with Spotify that is I can't log in my old account I always try but never work even if I try to sign in it's still not work it's not making my account neither letting me use my old account please solve this problem I really love Spotify songs, I hope you will get this problem repair soon thank you!",3
So many ads and frequent😒😒,1
Love the variety of different music available.,4
"Love the service, using the app when i actually want to works flawlessly. but the app has 1 big issue for me. It tries to open spotify and play my local audio files when i open them outside the app. and is making it impossible to play them with the app installed. I have it set to not have permission for local files but it reads them anyways.",1
I can't use it. It keep showing the logo only and not load in. I have delete and download it back several times but it didn't work,1
I don't like it u can't pick what playlist you want to listen to unless u pay and u can only skip 6 songs a hour and I don't really like how glitchy it is,1
"I'm a bit confused, I wanna play songs from an album only but I can't and rather it plays random songs I don't know what, but I'd like to go on artists and play songs from their albums",3
Love Spotify-I can pick music thar calms me. Better than going to a bar or a therapy session!!!,5
App crash on Android 12,1
I would give it 5 stars because i like music but what they did with the premium is messed up they went from a cool app to a money hungry app,4
This app is amazing but i thing or not there download option please give download option to download the song,4
Good app but now there is a big bug in this app We open a song but it play a different song everytime This is a very bad problem Please fix it,2
Fantastic! Love making my own playlists and being able to access new albums immediately...,5
I love everything about Spotify. I have tried Amazon and Pandora and just feel Spotify offers more. I can find even the most obscure music here.,5
I enjoy the variety of music that sporty has to offer. Is amazing. All kind if music,5
Very laggy. Before and after update. Even tried to reinstall. But still laggy. Sometimes cant even open.,1
I am premium user although I can't see canvas feature on my account. I have been updating but didn't worked.,4
It's nice to use it allaw you to listen music's while using other apps,4
Can find all the music I want and works offline anywhere so it's great for my job,5
Started hiding songs that I added to my Playlist and won't let me unhide them,2
"Spotify shuffle a bit weak, but so many premium subscription vouchers.. should be five stars!",4
"Don't like the way you have to get premium for almost everything in mobile, but in pc there is no problem except for the ads. Other than that there is no problem.",3
"Its decent, I just wanna know why I get hit why 5 ads every 2 songs",2
Good app but fix your bugs. They are too many!!!,3
It's actually good if you are a premium user,1
Really like how I can create a playlist ..,5
"I love the app but I'm experiencing a lot of problems lately 1. The app keeps glitching and becoming faulty .I have tried uninstaling and redownloading the app many times but it still doesn't work 2. I can use the app but music can stop playing on its on . Also the controls for the app go Grey so when I want to stop music ,I have to close the application and sometimes that doesn't work Please help I really don't want to be using apple music 😢",5
I can't play my fav songs before the shuffle play,1
Not used to the interface yet.,3
Excellent this app for music is so good I love spotify,5
"I hate the fact I can't put the song I want as a free user, I just want this one specific song to listen to first in my liked but I only get to hear a couple seconds of it, I have a bunch of liked songs so it's hard to get to the one I want in my liked. Also the 6 skips only and having to wait for more skips is annoying as a free user",2
I chose my music and found it good,5
"This app is good after all but sometimes it doesn't play the song that I wanted to listen to, and also I hate the skip song limit (6 skips per hour) and I want it to be removed because it's annoying and frustrating. I'll rate 5 stars if you fix those issues.",1
Video podcasts are still unplayable.,1
In advertisement there is option for downloading song. But in that app it is missing,4
I love this app sm and use it every day. The only thing I'd say is I wish they had the same features on phones as on laptop such as making folders and seeing friend activity.,5
"Love this app. Its helping me to listen different category of songs with different genres with lyrics. Like whenever a song hit my mind then i used to open this app. In gym, walking, traveling, study time, lonely and sleep time this would be helpful to enjoy music. Thank you Spotify.",5
Best music streaming app,5
I will never use premium. Show me adds as much you can.,5
This is dissapointing. Cant listen for 1 minute without a damn add,1
Good platform. I love it,5
"Its getting worst day by day literally just after 3 or 4 songs a dozen of ads pop up, u cant even skip them.....just have to make your ears bleed for straight 5 minutes....uselesss app",2
Too much aids.... And some old songs are not found,2
This app will force you in every way to buy its premium and after 3-4 songs it again given you 3 ads,1
"I don't like the new update because I can't skip songs, I can't drag in timestamps and this app suddenly add songs that I didn't put in my playlist.",1
"I get that you need to show ads to be profitable and grow your company but the amount of ads your app is showing me is just crazy, I counted the ads last time, I was playing a playlist and after playing minimum 1 to maximum 3 songs this app showed me a 30-50 seconds ad, in other words 5-6 ads in an hour. You do realise that you're just driving me away instead of persuading me to buy the premium? Please reconsider your ad amount.",2
Love Spotify. Do recommend for anyone who's thinking about downloading it.,5
I bloody love this app. A bit buggy at times (especially offline) which cost it the full 5.,4
"Offers all the artists & podcasts that I want, but every update makes it worse. It's been a year and this is still true.",3
It's kinda slow sometimes but then again it might be my phone but so far it has been nothing but amazing,4
"It does what it does, unfortunately not well but not like there's much better options. The app basically decides what you can't do and when. Want to actually listen to songs only from your playlist? Too bad! Here's a song that's not even in it! Want to repeat your music? OOPS! Gotta pay for that! Want to listen to a song on its own? Why would you! Here's a playlist that you have to skip through! Had the app for 4 months when out of the blue it started limiting what I can do. Annoying app.",1
Why my Spotify doesn't have a loop icon ! I'm so frustrated,1
Amazing App..Smooth interface.. great collection,5
"Too many ads like seriously...now they are giving ads after every song..and they keep saying ""music ad free hi accha lgta hain"" dn don't give ads ... No matter how they try to change our minds with their ad style I am not gonna pay to listen music ... I would rather sleep...worst app ever",2
Love the way the music is displayed and organized,5
Fix your systems! Cannot play more than 3 sec and stop. Cut my premium 'cos of this,1
Tis fine but Ads should be skippable atleast,4
For me it's very cool music app,5
Love Spotify!! I use it literally everyday!,5
"This app is good, plus the quality isnt that bad, but its too restricting I cant even play the album I want, its just gonna play the song that isnt on the album or it plays the suggested song. Plus the ad is so loud for no reason, even louder than the song itself. The ads are annoying too, it just pops up infront of your face. I have a 27hr spoti playlist and some of the songs is repetitive it plays over 2 times while the other songs never play.",2
Great music and service,5
one of the best music platform but I didn't find any music's lyrics,5
This app is good for listening song but ytf ur giving add continued after one song?,2
Awesome app i love it and i have never experienced any problems with it here in 🇧🇼,4
This app keeps on sucking me since I updated. It does not play the song that I have recommended but it will rather be streaming another song that I have not even seen it.,1
I like the app works very when I want to listen to music during class,5
Amazing App ! Easy to listen to music on Spotify.,5
So many great albums and music being released all the time but I don't find it until months later because yall cannot put it into recent releases?? Why??? Why do you want me to listen to some trash dance music from drake but when a upcoming star like trapland pat releases yall can't even SHOW ME it. I'm boutta switch to YouTube music fr yall making me miss out on too much,1
My Spotify app doesn't work on wifi network. I don't know what's the problem but it need to be fixed. I even tried doing reinstallation but it didn't fix.,1
Best music app I ever used foreals ! Always finding the songs I want an more ! An the playlist they be making !! Sheesh slaps for days !💯🙏🔥🎧,5
Still trying to figure out how it all works. Sometimes. Music starts playing all by itself.,5
"I paid for a premium account but songs won't play. I press on the playlists but it just says its empty. Tried uninstalling and installing again, still the same issue. I don't know what to do",2
This app is where I listen to all my music,5
Amazing if you have premium and if you can't afford you still have 3 months free,5
Many ad and not connection to internet,1
Okay but adds are annoying.,3
My network is fine but it doesn't download and says no internet connection,1
This verry good music platform Thank you,5
It's not bad. It works perfectly in my phone I don't have much to say except good job spotify crue,4
Best music streaming app in Play Store.,5
I love it sooo much it has a lot of songs but they could add more kpop,4
"The best music streaming platform, even though I don't have Premium, still, the quality is at its best!",5
Its The Best Music App I Have Ever Seen,5
Can't open after clearing catch data,1
Fun and relaxed way of listening to music and podcasts,5
"I love it. Just the algorithm doesn't really work well for me. I get very weird recommendations like church songs, rocks that are not my type and podcasts that I'd never listen to, but not all the time. I got some very goodie goldie song recommendations too.",5
This app breaks if you try and put your music on sd card for offline use. It's been a problem for years and I see no hint of a solution.,2
Unable to login,1
"loving it can live with the ads so not subscring....yet! Ok subscribed, family plan. Very much worth it!",5
The UI malfunctioning in dark mode.,3
Totally good no hangs or g glitches alot of options too,5
"Spotify itself, is such an amazing app! Even though, I was connected on the phone, I was still allowed to connect here, on my computer! This app is a defenite 100% five star! And it can even auto-pause your music when you are on a different app that includes game music, or something! But for the people that did not give Spotify a five star, you should now! Again, this is a great app! Thank you!!!!",5
"Im here to rate Spotify not cuz It's good or anything like that. But to appreciate their amazing Marketing plan. The voice that says ""ever wonder how the other side lived"" is sooooooooo annoying that ppl would ""Switch back"" to premium just so they don't have to hear that voice👏🏽",3
"can't choose song, can't skip song, too many ads",2
So today bug is I have no play or pause or anything to stop music. I can select a song and it plays. But I can't pause it or anything. Lol,1
"Why do you need my card details for free premium😡 Songs in liked list dissapears out of the blue.song search needs a lot of improvements. Anything good in this app Is its ads, very irritating, just like they wanted it.",1
"Edit: they patched spotify to encourage users to buy premium, otherwise free version is pandora clone. Premium is worth it tho.",4
Love it but it's been laggy lately,4
Not as easy to navigate and search as others,4
Honestly love this app gets me through my day and works well the adds aren't so consistent so it doesn't really bother but I would love to atleast have the control over changing my songs even if I'm not signed up for the premium version but still a pretty good app,5
"Super annoying to use for both podcasts and music. When listening to a podcast, sometimes it will skip either way back or way forward, so you have to be on the app just to see if the podcast is on the right EP. Plus Ads are atrocious. Sometimes the 30 min uninterrupted won't work. And if it does work, when it's up you'll get about 4 ads in a row before you can listen to your playlist again. What happened to this app? If there was a better music app, I would've switched long ago.",2
"even though having premium is amazing, there's still a lot that spotify offers :) i love the personalized mixes",5
Y'all are the best music app ever,5
"This app is amizaing cuz you can listen to music anytime you want, and after the update it got starting to be restrocting cuz of the shuffle plays and i can't listen to music properly, please remove the shuffle play",2
Sweet sweet every song by my favorite artist just like that so cool,5
Wonderful variety of music is excellent,5
Favorite streaming music player!,5
Liking the new 8 ads for every 20 secs of song. And the pop ups every time you try to get the lyrics. You massive trillion dollar corporations don't get the money you deserve.,3
"POOR App ,Every 20 min Ad roll Continues..clear the bugs",1
"Best app if you are sad or bored you can listen your favourite music, podcasts, Artist or playlists I like this application",5
I have internet connection and other apps is working good but in Spotify it shows no connection while searching.... What is this.?? Tactics to get more premium membership.... Very cheap and annoying Worst experience....,1
"Spotify is evil. It's owned by the music industry. This is their way of paying the artist they already barely pay even less. And don't forget, the crumbs that they pay the artist from Spotify is still 75% their. So when they ""pay"" an artist a dollar the artist gets .25 cents and they keep the rest. Spotify is the most disgusting thing these greedy record companies could come up with. They already rape their artist and take all the money they make in exchange for doing nothing at all.",1
I'm paying 9.99 every month still it is another month not getting what ads.last payment 16/1/22,3
I don't like how it can turn on by itself when I try to listen to video on my car and it will start running not a good thing needs to be delt with soon,1
I try to play a song that I always listen to and it plays something else not the song i want to listen to at all. I can go right to YouTube listen to it without no problems on YouTube at all.,1
"Randomly stopping while playing and when I restart app or song, there are no controls on screen.",2
"I like the app, and I can find music relatively easily. The only issues I have are that if I add too little songs to a playlist, Spotify adds more, and there are so many ads. I can barely go 5 songs without getting 5x the ads. I understand that premium features are to earn money, but limiting skips and features that some people need but can't afford behind a price is not understandable to me.",2
The app is easy to use and produces good sound quality when subscribed to premium. The downside is you have a lot of missing songs 🤦🏻‍♂️,4
Literally only good paid or on a computer,3
Was good. Started getting glitchy over last couple of months until it stopped working. Despite reinstalling ap. will change to someting else.,2
"After updated, i lost my all playlist on this apps. But if i opened on deskop, yeah, i can see my all play list on deskop. Please fix it",5
I like this app and uses it practically everyday or whenever I need to listen to music only problems is that some of the ads to me are weird but other than that really good,5
"You shouldnt have to buy premium to play an individual song, instead of it randomly generating a playlist and shuffling it into it for you to find.",1
Why you gotta play adds before the song even ends bruh,1
Random log out and when I log in again with the same email and password saying that my password is incorrect. Very enjoyable music player. So I gave you my 1 star :)),1
"So I got asked to leave a review again, not changing it from 1 star because, while I use it everyday, I would jump apps in a heartbeat it someone made a better podcast app. I pay for spotify. Any justification for ads on podcasts when I pay FOR NO ADS is BS.",1
Crashes all the time and won't play downloaded music or Podcast half the time,2
"Great app for music but missing so many tracks from so many artists and gives preference to iOS devices for updates and features, appreciate if swipe to queue feature is rolled out soon enough, as the iOS users have been enjoying this feature since years.",5
Absolutely shite can't even listen to the song I want to super long ads just not as good as it is in consoles,1
Very good app better than Pandora,5
Very reliable for me...loved Wide selection in all,5
Having a great time playing music that I haven't heard in years.,5
"It glitches lots lately,not happy with how it stops during songs and pauses, it needs to be fixed",2
"The new enhance feature is awesome, the algorithm has added so many songs I love that I never would've heard of to my playlists",5
"Excellent songs.good collection.. song and music quality superb..daily mix is very nice..on the whole i enjoy this site... music always gives your brain soul so much energy., and it is very relaxing.",5
I'm not very technical but I'm happy so far,5
"So After 3 Years I Log Back On And, ITS FIXED. THANK U SPOTIFY I WUV U! Here Is what i said on october 26 2019 : the new update is TARABLE i hate it i can't play songs from playlists i say they shold bring back the old vison and everone thats with me commit down below",5
"The Android app continues to suffer from years-long issues. Failing to detect internet connection, randomly closing, weekly playlists not updating, playback stopping entirely or momentarily a couple of times a minute. On both a Samsung Note 9 and now still on my S22 Ultra. Constantly needing to clear all data and reinstall the app. The iOS version is much more reliable.",2
Best way to listen to our favorite 🎶 music,5
"I'd like to see all my top podcasts when I open the app; I only listen to about 5 constantly, but some of them disappeared from the home list. I pay for premium, but aside from no ads, is there any other benefit?",4
"Won't connect to kenwood, spotify has no fix for 2yrs",1
It is a good music app but it ain't you-tube,3
It's was good for the first seven days but after that it sucks I tried to get premium but I couldn't cause I LIVE in quebec it's dumb also now when I play a song it plays a complete different one,2
"The app always plays songs that aren't on my playlist, I tried removing the songs from my playlist but I can't find them. They're not in the recommendation either, please fix this.",1
"I cannot see anything when I go to my library, all my playlists are gone. The app is unusable.",1
"Player sucks, service is ok.",2
Spotify is also part of Apple Inc and billboards are top charts,5
It's really easy to use,4
Love how easy it is to personalize,5
Brilliant and easy,5
I love this app bc it has any types of songs you can listen from here i recommoned to have this app! :D,5
You should be able to cancel your subscription from the app.,1
"I search song, i get song, i play song, i never get to listen the selected song, shuffle forced, system forced, hate more than i need to :-(",1
"Very pleased with the ""free"" version of Spotify.",5
"Says I can listen to music offline, sits and tries to load my Liked Songs for minutes on end before showing me the songs I already have downloaded",1
This is a pretty great app. There's just a couple problems I can't explain,4
"When I first got the app, I really enjoyed it. No ads, could play whatever I wanted, etc. But just today they put in this awful update that makes it so you can only preview songs in a playlist, making it hard for you to pick and choose which song you want to play when playing the playlist at once. I'm suddenly getting ads and limited skips now, something that wasn't happening before. And this only happened within the last 2 weeks of getting the app. Sorry guys, not spending money on music.",3
When I pick a song it always plays a different song please fix this bug.,3
Great to listening to music,5
"Premium user , my downloaded songs keep getting deleted from time to time and I Have to uninstall , reinstall , and then Re-download music all again. Why am i paying for a service that instead of making things easier , it's making it harder for me. Unacceptable",5
"Has been great, hate to say that too early though...",5
Awesome great music.,5
"Why should I download offline and I won't be able to view the lyrics unless I switch to online mode. If I use Spotify, it's because of the lyrics Please work on this. The lyrics should be downloadable offline. Treat as URGENT until then it's a 3 star",3
"Love Spotify, but please move the ""heart"" button so it's not next to the ""cast"" button. I unheart songs all the time and it is so annoying!!! Please move the cast icon to the left of the song titles rather than kn the right next to the play/pause.",4
Its great but it glitches sometimes!,4
"It's good but I have a beef with Spotify in that I can't get certain songs on it, and sometimes a song I have will be taken away unannounced for some reason. Last thing, shuffle play isn't great. I have 600 plus songs. I shouldn't be having the same few songs show up for days in a row. It's good though. I can barely keep up with all the recommendation playlists.",4
"Somehow my favourite tracks are hidden in one of my playlists (which I never did) and I can't unhide them. I have switched on ""Show unplayable songs"" in my settings but the ""Hidden"" Button is still broken. Please fix this, I'm paying money for this app each month.",3
I love this app it has amazing songs and all the songs I love,5
Great choice of music with wide range of genres.,4
I called several times. No one seems to understand my problem. It playes ever other song in a different language. Not hard to understand. Bad system for my phone. I am done with them overall.,1
"This app is great but., sometime songs or storys that I'm listening to stop and then when I try to replay the it keeps say ""nothing is playing"" but you can still here it usually it's just needed and update but not all the time so Please fix this thank you.",4
"I love this music app, the music is amazing then the lyrics ect I think Spotify just has more options compared to other music apps like pandora",5
"Its a great app! Has worked perfectly across multiple phones my sync system in my F350 operates it for hands free, it does take a little time to figure out the bells and whistles of it but once you do it works great! Oh and it works with my android tvs and I can control them from my phone with the app as far as music is concerned. Good job devs!",5
"Repeatedly stops during a song. Updating, uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't work.",1
"I can't renew my Premium Plan, My payment details doesn't show up when i try to renew. i don't know if i'm the only person experiencing it. Help!",4
Needs to be just the song or Playlist that is chosen to be played by the listener and needs to have no premium and should be add free,4
Because I find all the songs that I'm looking for and I like,5
What is up with all these updates there is literally an update every other day just make one big update and leave it alone for a bit. I feel that everytime I want to listen to music I need to update it first. Literally your last update was on June 19th and there was just another one today on June 23rd think of these updates all at once if you can cause all these constant ones are just annoying at this point. I love listening to music on this app but I feel I'm doing more updating than listening.,3
Spotify is the best application to listen musics and play podcasts.İt is functional and pretty easy to use.I have never experineced any tecnical problems so far and I can almost find the every song that I wish to play!Sound quality is amazing and playlist accses is more refined compared to other apps.You can convinietnly connect it to various devices and play in different platforms.I would be so glad if Spotify crew made those facilities that I mentioned more reachable for free users too:-),5
I really enjoy Spotify. Great improvement from what I was listening to.,5
Why the hell Bluetooth headsets of all brands get disconnected while using this app. When will you ever rectify this? Irritating to the core,1
Maybe I will rate it 5star after I have maybe enjoyed the spotify,1
Music is good nice selection of songs,4
Worst app ever you cannot skip a song plus you cannot listen to a specific song. Don't download it. They're giving advertisements lije its a best app in the world. Disappointed!!!!,1
Excellent streaming service,5
Bro it never did this and now after every single song it plays an ad tf is that about like what,1
2022: finally 🙌 2020: still nothing? 2018: Can we have swipe to add to queue feature like apple have?,2
Best music streaming app.,5
"Easy to use, I was able to make a great play list that I can listen to anywhere. Able to use with my phone or laptop.",5
"No update is complete bs, it automatically updated and now i cant choose my songs, skip more than 6 times, and now i get ada after every 2 songs. Stupud stupid stupid money greedy company",1
Excellent app for everyone's musical choices,5
App is amazing but we don't listen songs offline,1
"Great when subscribed to Premium, but my favorite part of Spotify is the Dumb Blonde Podcast by Bunnie (Jelly Roll's amazing and beautiful wife).",5
"This music company js absolutely disgusting. Not only can't you play the song you want if you don't have premium, but it also has ads. Absolutely horrible and definetly not worth it without premium.",1
Too many ads.,1
Not working properly,1
Since the update. Spotify has change layout on mine and not on other people I know. Also doesnt play the right songs that are in the album of playlist. As play artists and songs that are not in the playlist or album. Edit: Still the same set up and its shuffling albums and play music from artists that aint put in playlist. Also playing music from different artists even tho in a specific artist album.,3
Still a solid choice for music,4
I like how you can select singers & groups ahead of time. Also the app puts together a daily mix based on your listening choices.,5
The best app to listen to my favourite music nice.... HD sound nice experience. The app is also easy to use. But the only thing in this app is.. The ads. I can't even listen to next of my favourite song bcoz of the ads. I get a ad after every single song and the same as and the same type of ad like: don't like interruption while doing this or that so buy Spotify premium. What if I don't have money to spend on some apps or if my prents don't allow to use money on apps. Then what should I do?,3
Spotify is the best😎.Trust me😌👌,5
I love Spotify because it lets me be me and not what it wants to make me to fit in. It offers me all that I want in music; there is nothing I have not found in search and their expanded program is awesome. Premium is wonderful and so inexpensive! I am sorry I waited so long to get it!,5
Suddenly the song stops and starts after an hr. I mean wat is this. Is someone controlling our device???,3
I can't get threw a day of work or home for that matter without my Spotify best app I ever used,5
"The computer app is awesome, but the phone app feels oversimplified. It's missing information such as track length, number of songs in a playlist, number of streams on a song, and when a song was added to a playlist.",3
Need to vary the ads more.,4
Great app however I would like to have the option of deleting certain songs from the suggested playlist,5
Redecillas aap sirisoly it doesn't work properly even not open porply .😠😠when I play song and .I went back to home then suddenly song Stoped this is not happen one but four to five time .😡😡 If I can't listen the music in background while working in another app so why should I have download this app? I should listen music in other music aap or on YouTube .,1
Amazing! Works great.,5
Always enjoyed this app. Every type of experience and type of music you need.,5
This app sucks. If you do not have premium you can not even choose what song u want.,1
Too many ads after every 2 songs ad comes,1
"Very inconvenient, in comparison to the desktop version",2
"Nice music App really, Would have given 5 stars but I could not subscribe to a premium service. Even with a Mastercard Debit card. It's really frustrating. Fix it and get 5 stars",3
"Amazing, for a free app",5
Amazing for listening to music,5
Guys I don't need add free music stop giving this amount of add... It's toooo much annoying for me,1
Amazing Just amzing I love it and the premium Pack Is So good to use,5
The algorithm knows my music tastes and gives good recommendations. I like the features that let you queue your playlist and edit as well. The collaboration and privacy features are good. I wish there was easier ways to set the sleep timer but the fact that it's there and has so many time options is fantastic. The radios are great and convenient. Overall recommend.,5
"Sportify is really a wonderful app, I was actually shocked when it created a playlist for me and in the playlist was actually the kind of music I listen to and some were particularly the songs I love. Am giving it a 5 rating start because the application and the team deserve it, it's really a wonderful app. I will be glad if I could get a free month subscription tho😊",5
"I've found that if I ask for one song by a certain artist, it is followed by a nice playlist that Spotify has put together and I can just listen all day without getting bored!",5
There's really a need for you to understand how annoying your ads are,4
"As others here have mentioned, the app is quite buggy. Constantly stopping playback for no reason, playbar freezing, and play button refusing to start songs. I'm currently looking for a different streaming service as Spotify refuses to ammend this issue and its gotten to the point where I spend more time fixing the app than listening to my favourite podcasts and music.",1
"Paying for family membership, Spotify keeps stopping, plays randomly after leaving the car & often no function to stop rewind or forward. More often than not have to go into my apps to force stop. Very disappointing!!!",1
Didn't realise when I downloaded that it's a trial experience and after a couple of weeks they pretty much make it useless to use. No thanks. Back to Amazon Music for me,2
Love it and it doesn't recommend some music from India that I might be interested in like pandopa,5
"I only put it to 4 stars because when I add it to favourites and play it the song is just short, and I hope you guys do an fix it cause I now only use it ones a month, and I love the app",4
Wonderful app easy to use,5
"I love it. Huge songs collection of any style music. High quality files and amazing softwere detecting the sound you like and giving you good recommended music for your preferances. App organised really well, it is a pleasure to use it. So thankful that Spotify exists and evolves.",5
Excellent app for all music needs.,5
As convenient as the app is its got some glaring issues. First of all if you download songs it still streams them vs using the download files. I know this because when I try to play a band I've downloaded it always delays going to an album or song if internet gets in a patchy area. As soon as I put it on airplane mode it works fine. Unlike the YouTube app where you download and it'll always play the downloaded video. I feel like this app is 15 yrs behind what other apps have figured out in 09,3
Really?3 ads every time I start anything?,1
"Well, Spotify is great as always, but the Android app has a few rough edges around Chrome Cast: 1. Disconnecting wireless headphones while casting breaks the cast, the app switchws to on device playback through the phone's speakers 2. Connecting wireless headphones while casting makes the app switch to on-device playback, I don't know why",4
A chance to reverse songs on free tear,3
"Everything is OK with but, ADD break z way to much irritating🙂",4
One of the best music streaming services out there. The premium membership is definently worth the price for no ads and higher music quality. Spotify also has a discover weekly playlist that based on your listening preferences will find new music for you. All in all Spotify is an amazing app give it a shot.,5
best for update 🤣🤣 and waste your net first and second play song i am listening the song but 1 min ma update i am open app crash 😂😂,5
It is a really good app but the ads get on my nerves but i dont want to pay for a music app,4
Can't disable Auto start when Bluetooth connects? Seriously? Not an issue with any other media app. Cook the books on total user streams much?,1
"I love the app, it's great and i even love the ad's! Never too far off a commercial.",5
2 stars becuase its a way to listen to music when playing xbox but the amount of ads you get ruins the whole thing. 4 songs and then 6 ads is what i tend to get most the time. Im looking for alternatives so i can listen to music on my xbox without being bombarded with ads,3
Is in awesome music app. I love it,5
Whenever I pick a song it will always play a completely different song.. Think I'll stick with YouTube 🖕,1
Very good app for music lovers where you can find songs and albums of your own choice...,5
Stop giving suggested songs instead of the ones I wanna hear,2
Love this!!! My 17 year old granddaughter got me hooked So many songs. Much better than Pandora.,5
I enjoy my summer vibe 🎶 all the time. I don't have no ads.,5
Spotify shouldn't create 'hide this song' feature because I can't listen to the song that have been hid from other people.,4
"After new update spotify only told us to buy premium , so much ads 😡",2
Very good app for listening to music.,5
The best to listen to music,5
I just love EVERYTHING about Spotify especially the podcasts. Will love to have a better sound quality though. 😊,4
Very nice music platform,5
"An amazing app for Listening music! Perfect quality and facilities! The only thing I didn't like bout this app is that we get a lot of advertisements which can ruin our mood for listening music 🎧. So, the thing that i'd request them to change is 'stop putting a lot of advertisements.",3
Use to be great. Had Spotify for a long time offline always worked well and stuff downloaded. Now it's super slow to pull up Playlist and sometimes doesnt work at all offline even though I pay. Not sure this app is worth paying for anymore.,3
Stupid adds after every single song now. Forget this useless app.,1
Had Spotify for over 7yrs now and worth every penny,5
Stop adding songs to my play list. And stop controlling my skip button.,1
I like spotify but they really need to fix the app. It pauses mid song then I'm not able to pause stop go back or anything.,2
Sorry man. Bad app it dosn't let me play my whole playlist and it just anoys me please spotify change this ill give it a solid 5 stars if you did. I am disapointed about this. Thank u,1
It's Soo smooth and the best of all 82 million songs and 4 billion playlist,5
I cannot like the horror story but you can send me a horror story next time you can send me horror story so I am delete you your this app understand,5
All good except it doesn't contain some of the great music covers that you can find on YouTube and that the only reason for my 4 star rating.,4
"There are better music options with less ads, for less money, and even free. This service is overrated and just not worth it.",1
Feel it hard to interact with as without premium you are forced to listen to other songs than the one you want. Which is annoying.,3
Love listening music to this apps,5
"Everyone around us is safer when a responsible gun owner is carrying… And TODAY, the Supreme Court of the United States AFFIRMED this fact in their landmark decision in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v.

In the last week Spotify keeps dropping In the middle of a song or in the middle of a Podcast and it does it repetitively about every 3-5 minutes. This needs to get fixed! I love spotify but I may have to change if it doesn't get addressed.,2
I can't say anything. Just awesome experience. I'm using it now with free benefits offered by you.😍😍😍😍 But plans are Little bit higher.😔,5
"you all playlists, artists and podcasts songs with lyrics.",5
I like it it's just that you can't skip less that 6 song per hour and i had a free trial of premium and the set up was completely different and I got so used to it that's all 3 stars,3
"So far so good... Love the home page,",5
This app is good but since few days I m facing a problem of no internet connection on mobile data but my net is working very well .. I reinstalled but then also I face the same problem. My internet service provider is Airtel.,5
I have learnt so much I did not know by reading the write ups about the artists!,5
Advertisments are repetitive,4
Love everything about Spotify,5
My Spotify Mobile app skips more than my old Walkman even when I have full signal. Friends send me links to songs for Spotify and it never opens up to the song they sent me so I just have to look it up myself. Want to create a blend with me? Too bad it won't let me follow the link to join it. Spotify Mobile is really garbage.,2
Frame drop is too much,5
I had some problems with it not playing the song I wanted but I found how to fix it just go on your phone then Spotify and do the same on your TV and play one song from your TV and you can play what you want from your phone after,3
My only problem random song shuffled.i want to listen to unstoppable sound and it randomly shuffle the song to happier.other tan that it's op,5
"I went into an area where my phone service didn't work and I've lost all of my music when the app closed out and booted me off of my account, which I can't get back into. The amount of ads being 4 to 5 every other song.",1
Good compilation of my type of music selection,5
There is a lot of advertising,3
It's the best app of music I have ever used,5
This app is unstable the automatically play song is on I really can turn it off I tried many ways it still doesn't turning off,1
"Been using Spotify since 2015 and really love it, bcoz they have all my japanese singers & song. Only hope to hear for some of jpop song which restricts for Malaysia.",5
Awesome .... Spotify helps me heal my heart with my favourite songs..,5
App is very buggy and annoying,1
Very new to Spotify but have heard wo wonderful things about the app.,5
Very good🤛 Excellent👌 in sound quality And so impressive in song shuffling What a brilliant platform like Spotify ✅,5
I really like that a there's a lot of music choice's but I wish there were less ads,4
Just love Spotify!.....,5
I can't even loop my favorite song and others bro put it on premium for no reason bro 🙄 sh*itty app,2
"A great app, all of the music you could ever want is here and for no cost at all, would recommend. Edit: But if you do want to pay, just use apple music instead, much better quality",5
Love it. I must say that i am impressed. I love the selections,5
So on moblie android or any other handheld device you cant pick what songs to play and it shuffles them. But on computer or xbox it does let you pick songs and if you want to shuffle them,5
Pretty fast Can always find what I'm looking for. I really love this app,5
"I use this app everyday. I just got the update and I can't even choose what song I want to listen to, skip songs I don't want to listen to at the moment or go back to a part I want to play again. it's frustrating😕😕😕 ALSO I HATE HOW IT AUTOMATICALLY SHUFFLES😭😭",1
Would be hard living without spotify.,5
"I have bad experience whenever I like to play the song, the aap is getting closed and the is stopped every time, can u pleas find a solution to it",1
Seriously the best variety of music!!,5
without network music downloads and listening songs and music,4
The best Online Music App I've ever used. I'm happy you've introduced it in Kenya.,5
Great music app hardly plays any ads but it sometimes pauses the music on its own and it can be annoying if you don't have premium. But overall it's a great app and I really would recommend it.,4
Like the options the app has easy to add and remove from existing Playlist,4
Good but there's a lot of ad :(,5
Now that spotify has got lyrics for most of it's songs!! It's become way better!! 💞✨,4
"Excellent service, much better than iheart.",5
Tired of seeing COVID-19 tags nonstop simply because a podcast talks about it.,1
Spotify is one of the good app for listening music.. But suggestion of the next song is not based on my previous/similar intrest.. Hence you have to work on the Artificial Intelligence & Machine learning so that similar songs can be suggested to the music lovers.. Just check on the YouTube how they are suggesting the similar songs..,2
Just perfect.But ads where residuals and they can be removed by,5
Waw all features are good 👍,5
It works really well bit the premium thing really makes it not worth it. U basically can't do anything without a premium account.,3
"At first Ioved this app! Until yesterday I set alarms with Spotify and it started to play random songs I have never played before. It does that when I click on a song too,I hope you can fix this problem.",2
The incessant prompt to join another person's session makes me want to drop spotify completely,2
Just my music when I what it. Albums as well as my favorite only. Make own Playlist/ multiple .,5
Works perfectly double thumbs up,5
A very good music app with literally hundres of thousands songs! Personal playlist made daily and weekly automatically and always find what I'm looking for.,5
I loved this app but it's been crashing so often that want to delete it!,2
It's very great from ganna... 😍🥰 and ganna is waste 🤢🤮🤮🤮,5
I don't use it a ton but it is good for my podcasts.,5
Worst app ..not at all loading in 150mbos connection,1
Love the service but the mobile app keeps freezing then not allowing me to pause or anything. Have to restart my phone to get it to work again. Incredibly annoying,2
Couldn't log in at all. Kept telling me I'm offline even though I have a strong data connection.,5
Giving 4 because everything's going on good but I cannot add songs by hold press anymore,4
They charge me twice a month and won't stop when I ask them to. Terrible customer service.,1
Some of my favorite songs are no longer available.,4
It was okay but then they updated it and all of a sudden I can only listent to my Playlist on shuffle mode. I also can't just listen to any song individually. They say it's free but you really have to buy premium to get anything good to come out of it.,1
Offline not supported.,3
Worst app I donno but everytime I play a song it suddenly stops working and I uninstalled this app then installed I update this app every time but again after one day it stops working . And this is happening with me from more than 6 months I am sure I'm not gonna install this app again !!!,1
"Works great have zero issues. I know its mainly used for music but fingers crossed they add a lot more books in the long run, already a good variety and abundance though so I'm rating 5 stars.",5
"The app constantly stops during play. The user interface is not designed very well, from the swiping that advances to the next podcast, to the fact that I cannot organize my podcasts. If it wasn't for Joe Rogan only being on Spotify, I'd use another podcast app.",1
Best music app ever I'm enjoying it 🎈❤,5
"I've been using Spotify since it came out, and have always prefered it over every other streaming service, highly recommend to my friend's and family, and highly recommend giving it a shot.",5
"The only downsides of this app to me are the audio quality is not as good as the mp3 i have in my storage, and since 99.9% of my playlists are Japanese songs, i dislike how some songs are region-locked, which i still have to find resources to download.",5
I really like listening to podcast on Spotify,5
"Spotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded music and podcasts, including more than 82 million songs, from record labels and media companies. As a freemium service, basic features are free with advertisements and limited control, while additional features, such as offline listening and commercial-free listening, are offered via paid subscriptions. Spotify is currently available in 180+ countries, as of October 2021. Users can search for music based on artist, album, or genre",5
Please add option to remove recently played,4
A Glitch keeps removing the play bar at the bottom and so i cant play or pause podcasts or music so i have to reset phone. Please fix this!,1
This music app good. This music app has alot of songs such as trending and old songs. It's have all the generation songs. In my opinion is this is a best app 💯💯,5
Can you PLEASE have audiobook episodes excluded from the Blended Playlists with friends. Makes no sense,1
why my account haven't fitur canvas on settings? n i have done update to new version n still nothing:(,4
I love the app but the ads suck!,4
I enjoy all the choices and quality of the music!,5
"considering how you're like a multi-billion dollar company, you wouldn't expect this app to be THIS bad. it's really laggy and crashes way too often. sometimes you try to search for a song but can't cause nothing shows up. and the main menu keeps loading for 7 years after opening the app every time. also; bring back the X on the perma noti. why would you even get rid of it? it's so much more troublesome getting rid of it without it.",2
"Pls fix the bug,went I play the song I want it plays other song",1
Best music app ever I recommend this app to everyone i know,5
It's a good app and I like the fact that I get every song I want to..,5
I'm giving it two stars because of a glitch Spotify has while sharing a song link to Snapchat. Like the song link is bizzarely placed with the image..... Usually when I was sharing I never had these problems but now it's too annoying. Like trying to place the link over the image is in itself a glitch. Please try to rectify it.,2
Good but advertisement,4
this app would be amazing if it weren't for how many adds there are for non premium users its actually so bad i get 7 adds in a row sometimes in-between songs and the same add sometimes plays again straight after it was already played for some reason they are so frequent too and they always use the same exact adds for weeks on end and having to listen to those things so many times a day when i just want to listen to music is driving me insane i literally know them all word for word now,2
"I do like this app and I listen my favorite songs of every bands I listen. The problem that I encounter is the shuffle whenever listening to a song it's always change to other music or songs. Pls do something about this but I will still give 5 stars for this app. But, pls fix those issues and problems of Spotify.",5
I think it's the best app for listening music 🎼 I really like it so much 😃💜,5
It is a very nice app for listen musics and enjoying podcasts. We can also make playlist. Wonderful app,5
"What happed to spotify? Constantly crashing. Stops playing. Cant stop it from playing, forsing me to close the app. Repeats the same content or song over and over. If i select another track, it dose it to that one. Dose it for android and iphone.",1
"This app is good and has all songs. Still I gave it 3 stars as the app is getting annoying day by day, it's ads are increasing making everyone crazy. Song-->Ad-->Song-->Ad",3
The Spotify app is more user friendly.,4
"You promote guns to invade other countries, and you don't pay enough to the artists, Spotify sucks.",1
Fix the App it gets worse with every Update randomly pauses etc.,1
Spotify is the best.. enough said.,5
Spotify is way better than Pandora,5
"Watched a ""watch this for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music"" ad, hoping for an ad free shower. One song played, and when it was over it immediately played three ads back to back. Thought maybe it was a glitch, but when i heard at least two ads after every song, I knew I'd been lied to. This is the kind of thing I'd expect from YouTube, but I truly thought Spotify was better than that. Please, don't make me have to find a new favorite music source after at least 7 years of dedication to you!",2
"Ads! So many! They promised 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening but sure enough, after 10 or so minutes there's at least 3 or 4 ads playing...",1
Please fix what is wrong with this app. It keeps stopping in mid play..I have uninstalled and installed very often. Getting sick of it.,1
Downloaded the app on my laptop but it keeps stopping. I did everything even logging out on other devices but still continued to stop worse experience,1
My downloads keep undownloading but besides that great app,3
What I love most are the weekly playlists,5
I love this Spotif music it has all my favorite songs,5
"I REALLY LIKE THIS APP. But when i see it again it changed, when i touched to play it the music, it play just a little but when i play it shuffle the music is full. PLEASE fix this app again to the original we always use. :) We love it.",4
"It keeps crashing. Also, it tells me to enjoy the next 30 minutes without interruptions but then I'll hear a commercial within the next 5 minutes. Then it tells me again to enjoy the next 30 minutes without interruptions... and then... another commercial within the next 5 minutes.",2
Very easy to use and enjoying to listen music,5
"Great music app. More enjoyable with spotify premium so theres no ads, but I feel like there could be less ads when you don't have premium. When you do an online mix, I think it's fine with ads to be on every few songs, but if your are listening to a playlist you made, i think there shouldn't be ads. And don't get me started on the limited skips. At that point I would just used YT music. I have been using premium for a while, so I don't know if the limited skips has been changed.",4
"The app is fine. But it's been 2 years and they're still showing ads during podcasts to premium users. If you want podcasts, go elsewhere unless you don't mind ads despite paying over $10 Canadian. If you only want music the app itself is easy to use and pretty intuitive. I found the ads excessive without premium, but no where near as bad as YouTube.",3
Overall Spotify has been a great way to listen to music. I love making playlists and listening to other stations and playlists too. Thank you!,5
Nice App for music while you workout or go for a walk. Ads are not to bad and they only pop up every so often.,4
One of the better streaming services.,5
"It's unbelievable how often this app crashes, pauses for no reason, or simply refuses to load or play anything, including downloaded songs. The queues often dont function. And I'm skeptical that ""shuffle"" truly is shuffled at all, the same songs always come up. Truly just a trash app. Spotify employees should focus more on doing their job and spend less time complaining about content.",1
Honestly I don't see anything wrong with this app. I've never had any issues with Spotify or anything like that.,5
Exceptional but slow,4
Very good .....way better than audio mack......,3
I really do like it but you adding songs to my playlist when it MY playlist I don't like how you just added songs without me verifying but other than that an ok app,4
"Great app, love JRE. Only downside is it crashes on Android occasionally.",4
I love this app but every time there is ad why and once I think to take spotify premium but then there are so many ad i will not take premium please solve this problem every one song there is ad...,4
Love it but group session doesn't work rn so sad :(,1
Spotify is cool. Easy to browse,5
Excellent. Very useful and enjoyable!,5
I think its good i can feel the music its not free but its nice app,5
"It's great to have an app for music, but the ads have become ridiculous! I'm getting four ads after one or two songs now and I can't afford the subscription currently... I really wanna know what happened to the 30 min ad free ""sessions"" that used to happen cause those were great for road trips.",2
Too much ads,4
"Easy to use, great way to organize playlists, so much accessibility. Love it.",5
"They say that this app is the front runner but it doesn't look so. The add to queue option is working in a very dumb manner. Whenever a song/ album/ playlist is required to be added to queue, it means to the end of the existing queue of songs. This is the logical thought for any layman. However Spotify adds songs next to the current song that is playing, this is a basic app mistake and i am thinking of cancelling the subscription i made. Hope they correct this basic mistake.",2
Incredible app. Easy to select songs and play,4
Loved building a Playlist together for our romantic vacation.,5
Wonderful and reliable app,5
"""Enjoy the next 30 minutes of ad-free listening."" Time to next ad: 15.5 minutes. This is a small issue, but it errodes my trust in your brand and contributes to my hesitation about getting a premium subscription.",1
"I like how easy to use Spotify is. I've been on the family plan for a while, but when I wasn't, the ads weren't too bad or too frequent. I do prefer being on premium in order to control skips, which song is next, etc (idk what the perks are now, I've had premium for a while). I like the ability to have mixed playlists with my friends",5
I love this app! U can make playlists by just searching an artist or song and I love the quality of the music. But I got few problems. I hate the limited skipping music and I hate when I'm listening to my music in the playlist and then suddenly it changes to a song who's not in the playlist and I don't even know the song. And I was searching for an app who can be free to listen to music offline. But on this app that's premium. I'll rate ur app 5 stars if you let us listen to music offline free.,2
Good but some music missing that I like,4
Excellent n easy to access music,5
"I don't mind the app, the music side is okay, maybe a bit annoying at times but it's the free version so I can't complain. But I do have a problem with the podcast side of things. Recently it won't let me listen to anything, even the ones I've downloaded. I've tried deleting and reinstalling the app but that hasn't done anything.",2
Good app 👌 👍 👏 for listening 🎶 👌 music hope you all guy's enjoying stay blessed all ❤ ❤,5
Too many bugs. I honestly might as well stick to YouTube because I get like 5 ads every 3 songs. The only thing that keeps me using this is the podcast and I have to uninstall and reinstall the app daily just to listen to them,1
"There's a plenty of problem in this app right now.First, whenever I click on the I wanted it's always different song. It's really irritating and when I play songs in my playlist it always comes out in different ways and another song comes in between. The older version is better than this one right now",1
the app always play the less popular songs..youtube is far far better... if a user asks for an artis.. then play the songs frm the artist.. dont play other songs from other singers... and play the top songs not the unknown songs.,2
Beneficial whilst having my long bath...listening to History of Rome padcast,5
This app has helped me through so much. My playlist is almost 69 hours worth of music from all different genres. I find tons of new music I enjoy everyday. Spotify premium isn't very expensive and it's totally worth it. Spotify has quite literally saved my life. 💚🖤,5
I will give 5 stars if you guys add the shortcuts with volume keys to skip tracks on the Galaxy s22 Ultra. Please add!!!,4
Always has what I am looking for.,5
"Songs have been stopping mid play for no reqson, i have tried everything from updating it to uninstalling and re-installing.",1
This ad after each song is so irritating,1
Too many advertisements,1
Alot of thought and effort put into the app and every feature. Pretty sure spotify knows me better than i know myself. I'd die before I switch to any other music playing application.,5
"So far so good, I've enjoyed the app no issue...So I'm keeping the last star for me 🤭🤭",4
Changed my comment since last time since more info came to light. However! You're the biggest music app on the planet. The bugs are starting to get annoying. Controlling another device shows a completely different song playing as example,3
"All good except ads. Ads are too annoying to be tolerated! The same ads are played in a loop. Now the app have become quite expensive in its way. Previously it used to give 3 months premium free for any premium pack, but now it reduced to 1 month.....",4
"App is crashing,fix this as soon as possible.After opening App get crahed. You have not fix the app crash.Not fixed yet. Usless appyou guys can't fix app crash.",1
Very nice application spotify,5
Superb quality. Funtastic podcasts. And all the songs available.... In short entertainment at our earpods....,5
"The ""premium"" algorithm is hot garbage. The UI is deliberately cumbersome and ugly, and for whatever reason the developers think that ""playlist"" means shove a bunch awful songs into a carefully chosen list constructed by a paying customer. Would never recommend this to someone who actually likes music. If you just wanna listen to Joe Rogan, I guess it's ok.",2
"Spotify is my go-to app. Driving to work, at work, in the gym, cooking at home, cleaning you name it. Spotify is my jam. Hope they start implementing more videos like with Joe Rogans podcast",5
"You guys have to decrease the number of ads , it's like i usually listen to songs for about 1-2 hours continuously and Spotify increase the rate of ads per ad , for using this much long you better decrease the rate of ads🙌",1
I enjoy the selection and the podcasts as a truck driver I listen a lot. The bad score is because I can't turn off autoplay. As soon as my phone connects the app turns on and starts playing and I will end up deleting the app if not fixed.,2
Too much ads like forever.,1
Too many ads,1
It's good but I have my data on and says I'm offline when I alr fixed the MMS port on my side in the settings so pls do something.,2
The app is good. Can make a selection list itself,4
"Ive been using spotify for a long time , and i usually buy the mini premium , but now i cant buy the mini premium because its always error or unable to reconnect , please fix this. Im from indonesia so i usually use a 3rd party payment such as ovo or gopay but it always says unable to reconnect and i have to buy premium mini from the spotify website rather than buying through the app.",1
I've been using spotify for years and find the app really amazing and well made. Yes I have come across some bugs and shortcommings throughout the years but nothing majour that hasn't been effectively resolved.,5
Best app subscription for music,5
Most of the music of the world you can find. Student deals on premium are a blessing!,5
Outstanding and best of the songs i love it,5
Advertisement from McDonald's is disturbing 😭😭😭. I don't know if I'm telling someone who can hear me to fix that Please...,1
People often complain about too much ads but i am using it since a week and only got 3 ads overall it's a great app,5
I am using this app for many years now.. but recently I couldn't find the songs of a particular artist in their official playlist. Like there are only 8-10 songs when they have made many songs. Please fix this!,5
Xlent but rarely it simple shows no internet connection 🥱,5
Lots of glitches lately like I can't scroll sideways on the ganra selector in my liked playlist,3
Amazing Experience But could you just provide a song recognition feature😁😁😁😁😁,4
It's gud free songs but when we search for one song it gives us whole album..can't play one song only,5
I like it. My car system wakes it up on my phone,5
Music for me changed because of Spotify.,5
"Can you stop shaming people for not taking your premium? I am fine with ads in general, but your toxic and obnoxious advertising collection is something else.",1
"Please stop adding songs to my playlist 🙏 , you are ruining my day with those songs",2
Fix the notifications pannel glich. Some time it doesn't see,2
Best music service ever,5
"I really have to pay for everything :'( I already have the ads, can't I have the freedom to play the song I want to.",1
"I really love Spotify but at the same time I also love Pandora I have been using Pandora for a while they have 1HR of ad free music Spotify only had 30 minutes of ad-free music so maybe that's something that Spotify can match so speak also I do not like the fact that you cannot scroll back to see who you recently listen to just now I accidentally said I basically didn't like it because this artest cause I pressed some circle with a line through just keep it simple, its a give n take :/",4
Just so so easy.,5
Not the ads but ok,3
"Been a customer to Spotify for years, it's the perfect app for music 🎶 imo",5
Love everything about Spotify,5
Onbording is very bad user experience. Not able to login even after successful registration. Uninstalling the app as not able to use it,1
It is really good it has a plenty of varity of songs u can find any song but ads are werid,4
Spotify is a really popular music app it has a great variety of songs and it let's you make your own it has got all the artists I can think of I really recommend this app,5
Spotify is a brilliant apps but it gives advertisement after every 2 song for the premium which is very irritating. I think u should the advertisement atleast after 10-12 songs .,3
"I like spotify a lot. But it glitches, I'll be doing something on my phone and till just randomly stop playing music! And i when i go back into the app it'll start the song over. Please fix this its so frustrating!! It happens often.",4
This app is great 👍 It has everything from 19 2000this app is great,5
Best music app in the world.,5
"Music is everything and Spotify delivers that and more! If you love discovering new music, Spotify will multiply all of your melodic tastes!!!",5
new update removed my ability to add the app as a widget on my home screen.,4
A lot of ads are poping while i listen songs. The time of poping ads is 30 minutes but now a days ads are poping every 10 minutes,2
It was good at first but suddenly it didnt let me play my favorite songs,1
Spotify will add random songs to your Playlist and not let you remove them without premium,1
"Do not download the update! I have tried everything from restarting my phone, to uninstalling and reinstalling it. It's saying I have no internet connection even though my S.O.s app is working since they had not downloaded the update. It also will not load at all! Please fix this asap Spotify! I use this for work and this is very frustrating for this to happen!",1
Love the advertisement ❤..,1
I dont like it . I picked a song I wanted and it keeps shuffling it it's just confusing,1
"Bro if your gonna increase the ad in between the music, and irritating people your gonna lose a lot of people. One add between 5-6 songs is okay and done. 2-3 ads btw 1-2 song is crusome. I love Spotify, so don't compel people into premium or else they will go in search of other music apps with free and less ad",2
"bug; when opening the app and playing music it will begin to play without a play bar, have to close the app and reopen to get it to function properly please fix edit: its doing this again pls make it stop",3
it's a good app but I really hate that I can't pick what songs to play as a free listener and there's too many repetitive ads,2
"Life savior, I ll never leave you, your the cheese to my cake. The cherry on top.",5
This is trash. I can't even listen to my favorite song it just play a different song.,1
Almost every track is available but the ads...,4
Improvement to use slow internet connectin and use low mb,1
updates nearly every day? what's going on? Actually I have never used Spotify on this phone! Uninstalled.,3
Go to app for music and podcasts .,5
The only problem is that you limit skips between tracks.,5
I love music 24/7 everyday all day long especially my corridos pesados,4
This is really interesting app because this help me as motivation guide,5
Super experience with spoty music,4
"Would be great if you guys put a tiny bit of effort into making this somewhat useable, it's a buggy mess",1
Very buggy! Rarely when you cast it a speaker!,1
Love this app it play all the right music no matter what genre era decade whatever I recommend you download and get a premium package to really enjoy it's features but the free version is great also,4
Nice app for all ever.so many songs many features i like so much these app THANKYOuu,4
Spotify has ALL the music. It allows you to organize it any way you want. Very flexible. The search feature is fast and accurate. The sound quality of their songs is very good. I really enjoy it.,5
good though some new songs aren't available,4
It's good but too harsh and restricitng,2
Best music all from - ever ! 🥰🥰🥰😇😁😁🥳🥳 but some Ads sucks 🥺,4
Great App Listing Music,5
It is best website for listening the music I use many websites like gana Spotify is best website to use for listening the music,5
I am so enjoying the music not really in advertising but I do tell my friends 🤠,5
Thank you Spotify for filling up my free time...,5
There are rarely songs I cannot find. Love it and use it every day for music and podcasts.,5
"I'm the type of person who prefer Premium Mini for when I feel the mood to listen to music seamlessly for the whole day. BUT the process of purchasing premium mini through spotify is so frustrating it kept on ""unable to connect"" and I've been ""retry""-ing for half an hour. My signal is pretty good but spotify doesn't even let me try to pay for my premium purchase 😩",3
Best app for listening to music and chill,5
I love Spotify will always use,5
Love it for my favorite podcasts,5
it is really difficult to login and log ou into ur account from different devices,3
A lot of problems making suffer in this application,1
Spotify used to be great to use however these recent updates have not been great. I dont have access to my liked songs and it wont play songs outside the app :/,2
"Easy to use, good recommendation so far.",5
It doesn't play the full song you click on,1
Have to re download again as I try to play one album but after first song is done it plays a completely different mix. Not the first time and it's painful every time as I have to re download all of the songs I want to hear in low reception areas,1
"I can carry with me, My entire collection, the soundtracks of my life.",5
"The issues I have are with its compatibility with Google assistant. Half of the time when requested to play something, it plays a completely unrelated song. For example for a while when asked to play Kelly Clarkson, it would actually play Kelly CARSON, a largely unheard of cover singer... it's quite frustrating when all you want is hands free compatibility.",2
great music selection and streaming quallity,5
its the best i absoluty love it i love lisening to spotifi,5
Nice app for listening song and podcast and funny things also,4
Spotify mess up for me and won't work. It is so bad 😭😭😭,1
"Great Music App, but I think it will be even more better if developer adds a sort of Volume control in the app for the gamers who love to play music/podcast while playing🥰",5
I wish I could listen to an entire pod cast without it stopping for no reason and making me re open the app and pressing play again before I can continue the pod cast.,2
"A couole things. First you used to be able to preview a song in the ""Add songs"" and now you can't. Second way too many adds for free listeners. Third if youre listening on any other device besides mobile for free listiners you have unlimited skips, repeat, can select a song and hear that song without having to skip to it, and your playlist don't automaticly shuffle. Yet on mobile you only get six skips per hour, no repeat, can't choose which song you want, and your playlist automaticly shuffle.",2
"I request utterly to change the dark theme, i am done with the dark theme player...",3
Perfect except I wish premium was priced maybe 5 instead of 10,4
This app is most likely in play music🎶🎶,5
Complete trash of an app focused on harvesting data rather than maintaining a functional UI,1
I love the Daily Mixes and Podcast that Spotify suggests for me!,5
Love the app. Great for listening to music.,5
One of the best playlist ever made,5
"Ackward user interface, but the worst is when it stops for no reason, and it happens often :(",1
Great music have the ability to have ad free but if you choose not to if it do have an ad maybe one or two consider it to your style of music when she request a song it plays and bring up other songs similar to that stuff,5
Friendly and easy to use... Great APP.... All the music you want. I totally Recommend it.,5
I love Spotify its just sometimes when I want to play a song It will bring um an album that's kind of anoying but I've all love the app,4
"The spotify experience has been amazing so far, it's additional function (lyrics) included in each music/podcast played by users make life easy.",5
Spotify only Play adds,1
Each Time I play a certain song and even when I add it to my playlist. This is kind of annoying and I wish it can be fixed if it can.,3
I love this when I'm in a mood I have a Playlist that calms me down I turn that on and fall in love and relax/chill,5
Payment for premium will not let me buy it and it keeps saying something went wrong,1
To many commercials. 10 dang commercials to get 15 minutes of music. WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. ITS AS BAD AS REGULAR RADIO NOW,1
"Keeps crashing. When you skip ads it starts playing at a different place, basically I think just self sabotaging to force me to buy premium, which I never will.",1
"Only thing I would change is when I make a file of songs, don't put in suggestions. I made that file to listen to the songs I chose.",4
I just wish there weren't as many ads. Also if you share an account 2 people can't use it at once. But other than that it's a great app!,2
"Fast pace life, play and go!!",5
Hands down the absolute best And only Music App you will ever need. Phenomenal at predicting more favorites for you to listen to 💯🤍,5
"They need to fix the update like soon enough. A lot of songs that aren't in my fav songs are getting in whenever I shuffle, The only way I fix it by deleting spotify and downloading again. It is a pretty good app tho.",4
Its been buggy as of late. Kinda annoying. Please fix.,3
Easy favourites and good suggestions,5
new update since 6/22/2022 9 gigabytes of space on my internal storage with no option to move to my SD card which doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Alot has been fixed otherwise since my last review in 2019 but would like to see the ability to move it to external storage.,3
The queue just doesn't work,1
I literally use it like every second of every day of my life I absolutely love it sm and it's even better with premium 😩,5
Very limited internationally,2
"One of my favourite, from discovering music to listening experience it has been a friend.",5
Luv spotfy.luv alot Romantic slow music. That Spotify. Luv u ever made Spotify. B safe.,5
Easy to use. Great recommendations.,5
Too many ads I mean if someone doesn't want to buy premium they just smash ads one after another.,1
Easy to find songs,5
This app has amazing sound quality.but can't download music from this app and many as issues also after all good 👍,2
"I pay to use this, and for the most part, no issues. It does occasionally skip to some other song, and it always wants me to go to car mode while in the car. Car mode is TERRIBLE! I always keep it off.",4
Music quality is excellent but too many ads for non-premium listeners,4
The best app in music but you should add sapne sajn ke too,5
Love Spotify. It soothes my soul because l lifting up the name of Jesus with all of the different artist l listen too.,5
"Get the family plan, it's worth it for a great experience.",5
"Áreas de mejora. Es muy necesario un buscador al momento de agregar canciones a una Playlist; para los que tenemos muchísimas listas, es casi imposible encontrar una lista sin un buscador. URGENTE Improvement areas. A search engine is very necessary when adding songs to a Playlist; For those of us who have tons of lists, it's nearly impossible to find a list without a search engine. URGENT",4
It used to be so good but now I can never get it to work it always says no internet connection available but I have internet because I can use Google YouTube Instagram and everything but Spotify just will not connect to the internet,2
"Deleted songs. I pay for premium. I should have close to 3,000 songs but Spotify thinks because I don't listen to 'em I'm a certain time frame that I'll forget about them. I'll have some saved for over a year, won't listen to it and I come back and it's somehow unsaved AGAIN. I pay for premium so I can listen to music when I don't have signal for Internet. It's so dang frustrating!",1
Excellent selection; very intuitive when finding music for us based on our own choices; super fast downloads,5
Spotify is a good app and all but recently I'll be listening to songs on my liked and then it will play songs that I never added nor have I ever heard off Is there a reason for this I'd like to know,3
I love this it helps me when times are ruff,5
It has most the songs you want to hear great app,5
"Spotify is my most used and favourite app. I think of myself as a ""power user"" and I'm curious of how the Spotify team sees me. All this rating business to me is pretty tired. Having my phone ask to rate an app is something I simply don't care to do for the most part. I start to wonder, when will we move past this need to be better. When can we just let be what is. When can we transcend to a place where everyone has access to the best music all the time because we know music heals and is good.",5
"The best music streaming platform ever, it even comes with offline access to all the downloaded songs. Before it, l was missing out a lot, look at me now 😁😁😁😁😁all smiles.",5
Been using it for years. Great app.,5
"The SW hangs and have erratic behaviour while driving in car.. the earlier version was a stable. Ever since the new version is applied, the SW behaves badly and creates trouble while driving. I have switxhed on to Jio Saavn to avoid further discomfort.- Many Thanks -Prashant Deshmukh",1
Best app for music when you have premium!,5
"App has gotten a lot better. Still prefer the old UI, but eh... What are you gonna do.",4
"Everything is good about Spotify. The best being that the app is always on night mode which reduces the strain on eyes, especially if you're like me who uses the music app like for the whole day. The only problem is that some songs and episodes are not available in your region, and I don't know why that happens. Overall, it's a must try app.",4
"Unfortunately, Sharing songs on Instagram stories doesn't work, please fix this",4
I love it. I use it all the time. I do pay for it. I get the 3 month thing at Wal-Mart.,5
"I've been using Spotify for years and I love it! It's super easy to navigate. But as of late the lyrics have stopped showing up on songs, from my understanding it's a glitch in the app but maybe I'm wrong. Another issue I've had, like many other's, is the ads. There are way too many and they put them in way too often.",4
Can't have a list of artists (based on saved songs) anymore,2
"I REAL-LY APPRICIATE A GOOD ,EMERGENCY RADII CHANNEL AND OR SPOTIFY EMERGENCY STATION RMERGENCY CHANNEL TURN ON.....I KNOW THAT I SHOULD BE TRIPPING CORRECTLY AND AM COMPLETELY...""SOMEHOW... ...""INVOLVED WITH A VERY BIG ********((((((***)))*****,******************************,***********))))))))SHOWBUSSINESS((((((********************CROWD CONTROL...ANSWER AND TOP,TOP PRIORITY ,AND TOP TOP SECRETS,ANSD SECRET SECRET EMERGENCY...OF AGE,AND TIME,AND...DATES BIOHAZARDS KNEW....THAT,THE SURVELLANCE,A",5
"I don't mind the ads (I've long since become used to it) but it's just so LOUD? The normal music I'm hearing is like on low / medium volume then the ads come on and tries to break my eardrums! Really, it's like someone is talking normally next to you then suddenly a kid starts screaming loudly in your ear for a minute, CONTINUOUSLY.",1
"Really like this app for music, but I'm sad that you can't download single songs from off of an album. You used to be able to do that, but with one of the later updates that changed. Please bring that option back.",4
A great range of music and podcasts. I've never seen Spotify down. Worth the price of 2 mugs of coffee each month.,5
"Unable to play anything at all, or even find a single item of musical interest to me. I have no idea what I am doing wrong, and simply don't care. Your app is idiotic. Looking for the unsubscribe link, but you've made that impossible to find too.",1
This is a very good app please download it and enjoy music,5
Canceled my premium and they charged me AND when I checked if I even got premium I DIDNT so they stole my money 😐 unbelievable. But app is good and works great but I'm actually mad about the stealing thing like I had to contact my cashapp n stuff and now im waiting to see if there's something I can do about it,2
It is the worst but the songs are good!¿,3
Perfect place to search olden music,5
If you like music you'll love Spotify !,5
I enjoy listening to various talented artists. Thank you 😊,5
"It's good, but that doesn't mean I like it that much. You can only skip 6 songs an hour, the playlists are completely random, and they add random songs to playlists. That's just a bit annoying, I think. Also, you can get rid of those problems by paying? That's a cash grab up there with, like, Bethesda, dude. Still, it has access to every song imaginable and plenty of great podcasts. It's basically a good app if you don't the interuptions.",3
Awesome music app. Spotify as everything I want to listen too.,5
"I don't like how to made it uninteresting to be honest, Why can't I repeat the current song anymore? And why can't I play the full song? Why is it all review?",1
That one thing you didn't know you would be lost some kind of way without. Music for the soul child in me feel found.,5
Not to bad premium is overpriced and no deal for students in Australia at high school.,1
"Constantly plays irrelevant songs to my playlist, and I can't seem to have songs play from a specific artist, only some mix (which includes anything BUT the artist), and I can't play a song in my liked queue nor close the app or else it'll play a new, irrelevant song.",2
It's an easy app to use and the selection is endles,5
This is so awesome to used because I get to listen to anything I want it is the best but there is one problem can you please put it as much skipping as we want. Please,5
Very useful all music I wanted choose no problem,5
"Adds random songs, doesn't play my play list, hides songs, adds every 4 songs, ads all the time, not just 30 minutes",1
App is really great an amazing always working great a few times there is a few problems but other than that it's perfect,4
"I hate this with all my heart this app is sooooo stupid because you have a limit to how many songs you can skip and I'm just trying to listen to the songs I LIKED and it just decides to give a similar song if I like a song I will like it of not don't give me those songs I can't even listen to like 3 songs before it gives me a ""similar"" recommendation it is sooo stupid and I thought that I selected a setting to make it stop and it didn't Spotify on phone is so stupid",1
Very buggy app. Tons of ads which are also broken (it says after the ads 30 mins of uninterrupted and then 5 mins later you get ads again). Constant issues with performance and premium is now unaffordable. Seems to be getting worse and worse. Do better Spotify.,1
After every 2 songs ads 🤬 can't even enjoy the music because of ads 🤬,1
"Super glitchy :((( Always crashing, never shows the play menu so you can't control what you're playing. Consistently having to uninstall and reinstalling just to get it to work, sometimes multiple times a day",1
I love Spotify works great and $10 a month for premium isn't to bad either I'd recommend it for sure,5
All mu favorite songs are there and wheb i got this phone the app was their all ready and it was no money for me,5
"This app is bs after the update... my phone won't work on it says I need internet connection. Why the eff am I paying for an app that won't work. Duck this, go to YouTube premium... lifelong subscriber to spotify but it ridiculous now... DO NOT PAY FOR PREMIUM",1
Horrible. Can't go back in a song or Listen to a specific song without premium. unless you have the funds for a premium account it's absolutely not worth it,1
Very helpful to listening of music,5
Very good app to listen to music especially when you have premium,5
"Spotify used to be great for listening to music. Unfortunetely they are forcing randomized play unless you are a premium subscriber. The premium service offered is worth, at most, $2.99/month, not $9.99",1
"Ok I love the app and all, but recently the new update is absolute garbage if you don't have premium. There's an ""add songs"" feature and usually you can listen to their 15 second preview to determine whether it's good enough to add but they TOOK IT AWAY? Update: THEY ACTUALLY PUT IT BACK YAY",4
took money twice but didnt give premium(chutiya app),1
Price plans are too expensive and artist aren't given enough share of income just listen with ads until Spotify support artist fairly,2
"This is literally the most savage way off forcing people to buy premium. You can not listen to the songs you want (which is literally the whole point of such apps) because it will only shuffle through playlists, giving you 6 free skips until you can't skip songs anymore. On desktop you can do everything you'd expect for FREE! But here they just want to rip you off. Screw this company! Better do something good with your money than spend it on premium for features your media player already has.",1
Great music and plays your favorite list of artist.,4
"Im just trying to listen to the music i want. I dont want to listen to some other songs i dont like. I had to watch tutorials on youtube ""How to listen liked songs on spotify""",2
"Better than Pandora. After a while the randomization of Pandora's shuffle ends up grouping a few songs by the same artist back to back. I get that that's part of the shuffle, but when it happens quite frequently it's noticeably annoying",5
I used the free version before deciding on going premium and it's the best decision I could've done. Now I've been on premium for 6 or 7 years now !! Would definitely recommend going premium if you can 🫶🏽,5
good quick source of music,4
Why can't I remove a song from a Playlist on the fly? And why can't I put a song on the shelf for a while like w Pandora?,3
App is crashing all the time and the sd card option was gone,1
Ty I enjoy music 🎶 on Spotify.,5
Sometimes the app just skips to the end of the podcast after an advisement. Now I have to scan through the podcast to find where Spotify decided I had to move on but fought back. If Joe Rogan wasn't on this app I would NEVER use it.,2
"The worst app I've had to use, love spotify but what's the point if I can't ever use it. I pay for premium just for the app to be nonfunctional for half the month because either my phone or spotify updated and now it just doesn't work. Nope still broken",1
I don't know what is happening but i can't play songs online and I can't download my playlist. Help me,1
"Great selection, easy to ise",5
The app is excellent but we need an update for the audio quality,5
I love this app because it has all my favorite songs on it.,5
"I can handle my playlist by myself easily , just 😍 ❤ loved it",5
"""Your Offline..."" UHH NO I'M NOT!! HOW COME 'YMUSIC' IS FREE FROK YMUSIC.IO AND WORKS!! And this app is constantly broken!!? I'm connected it works!",1
Don't download unless you're paying for premium If you're listening for free you'd only get frustrated trust me 🚮,1
"22 Jun 22, Spotify bluetooth works well on new Galaxy phone, but is not working on Pixel 4 XL. 7 May 22, Spotify needs a change of management like Twitter! For 2+ years now, Spotify videos do not play on Android devices while connected via Bluetooth regardless of Bluetooth device. 16 Feb 21 update: Struggling on Spotify !!",3
"I really like using this but of recently I've not been able to pay for the premium package, I want to, but it keeps declining my card, i would really like you guys to look into this",3
"app constantly crashes, don't play in car because you'll be trying to open phone and press play just to do again in 30 seconds. only reason to download is joe rogan, other than that it's garbage and doesn't work",1
Spotify is DOPE!💯,5
"I enjoy the music. It's my first time to use it, I am loving it already. I have my playlists, of songs I love, following each other without interruption 😄😄😄",5
Needs more music in Spanish,1
Nice way to find good music!,3
"The app isn't bad, however there are several issues. Firstly, you can make a playlist of songs you want, however you can't choose which to listen to, but have to play shuffle, and even then you either play shuffle again or skip a song (6 skips every hour is ridiculously low amount) to get to what you want. After every song there are 3-4 ads. I understand it is a free service, but considering artist are barely even payed, this is ridiculous. Overall would just recommend downloading songs instead.",2
I love listening to music on here. I have given it a 4 star because of 2 reasons 1) there is adds all the time. 2) you can't listen to it offline. I would be more joyful (to me) if we didn't have adds all the time and we can listen to music offline. Apart from that it's amazing.,4
"Really good experience with Spotify, but sometimes the bar to pass to the next song just disappear and I have to reset it",4
It's good but why can't we play offline music,4
"Spotify is a great app; a one stop shop for good music with inbuilt lyrics to help anyone sing along. My issue however, the personalized playlist should be more flexible. People should be able to play a particular song at will instead of the shuffle play.",4
Love it so far i can type in artist and fet all their songs i love.,5
Excellent app for all all occasions and moods,5
Super and real time,5
App not running on wifi.,2
"It plays ads during podcasts even if you have premium, I don't mean the podcasts's ads I mean their own ads that interupt the podcast",1
It's amazing sound feeling I love it spotify 🙃,5
Great! Only complaint is that I still get notifications for podcasts I don't listen to anymore but I'm sure there's a setting or something I've missed.,5
It takes minutes to start any podcast,1
Can't seem to do downloading og songs,5
Crashes all the time,2
Streaming skips on Fold 3. Not even usuable,1
"Outstanding! Out tastes are all over the place! Incredibly everything we looked for my spouse and I found ! Philippe & Marta Monbaron. Czech, Swiss and South African.",5
"Spotify sucks, for so many reasons. But for consumers, it sucks because the shuffle mode doesn't actually shuffle anything. It just chooses songs you've heard a million times, or songs that are most popular. They have no plans to fix this issue. I wish I could give you 0 stars.",1
Fine playing but can't download,3
Everytime I try to listen to My Playlist it plays some random songs that I haven't added and if I try to skip it I run out of Skips because I have free Spotify it's not that I don't have enough songs on my playlist I have over 150 W I can't listen to them and I have to listen to some other stuff,1
Spotify my main music app they focus on both side of the cellphone spectrum with good quality sound,5
Becoming very slow to load,3
Just too much of advertisement. Which gets irritable.,3
"Please help I can't seem to get lyrics for any song,even after updating",3
Paying for premium and getting publicity all the time,3
All we need is no ads,5
Love the Playlist,5
"Avoid the free version at all costs. They have gone to great lengths to make listening to specific songs impossible. Not only is there no way to turn off shuffle, but spotify will also add similar songs into the mix, forcing you to skip whenever these come on. That is rather annoying by itself, especially when driving or otherwise occupied, but in case that wasn't bad enough, there's of course also a limit on how many times you're able to skip. The design is openly hostile to the user, avoid it.",1
Newest update has issues. Sometimes I'll leave the app open in the background and music will just stop randomly. Sometimes on shuffle the app will somehow lose track of what song is playing and it'll play 2 different songs at the same time. Closing the app with 2 songs playing and one song will continue to play despite me closing the app completely and there no way to stop it,3
It quite working an I can't use. It.,2
I have no problems with it and they have all the music I've been looking for,5
"This is an app that is impossible to run freely, so get premium it's worth it having your own library to play whenever you want. But my issues is Spotify's attitude toward musicians who get paid little from this service and choose to leave. Between YouTube music and this, YouTube Music is superior because EVERY artist and song is there.",2
The best app for Spotify,5
You give sooo many ads...can't even listen to songs peacefully,2
The app switches to ads about 5 mins in and then restarts or moves to the next podcast in the list. Garbage. UPDATE: Half a year and it still randomly crashes and shuts off my podcasts...,1
Great Music! Great Access!,5
Too many songs that I love are banded? Or not available on spotify!Spotify!! There are remixes that the artists even publish themselves but for some reason Spotify doesn't allow to play? Some amazing songs on tiktok.. and spotify cannot keep up :( will probably discontinue use,2
"Thanks to Spotify, I've learned the band names, which radio shows rarely disclosed, and by it's suggestions, has opened me up to bands I'd never even heard of before. So happy with it!!",5
Best music app I have ever used,5
I love Spotify. Every song I wish to listen to is there. Great app,5
It's awesome platform for music.,5
Why can't you shuffle like songs,3
Love the availability of music and the selection,5
Very good and i love the app But the fact that it doesn't shuffle and plays an artist song is what i don't like,4
Not able to block other apps from disrupting music,2
"Content is okay but my music pauses constantly when app is playing in background. This just recently started happening and I have tried all of the ""fixes"" suggested by spotify. Very annoyed to be paying for premium and having an app that glitches all the time.",3
"Good music selection sucky app... I have a lot of my favorites on here but the app is so glitchy! Half the time it will just randomly pause and you then have to close out the app and re open it. If you don't it will pause off and on faster. Sometimes it seems it works better with the app open with the phone unlocked... It acts like free YouTube sometimes, difference is I pay for this so I would LOVE to lock my phone and it not freeze up even more.(I would do less stars but it has a lot of music)",3
"Ever since their last upda5e I don't have the little menu you can toggle with the sing that's currently playing to fast forward/pause/ etc which is pretty annoying, music also glitches out all the time, stops playing randomly. Seems every update I'm missing another feature that use to be there...",1
Way to much ads,1
Great app best music streaming app out there does everything I want at a great price .,5
Best songs collection and UI,5
Better collection of songs than gaana or interface is very realistic and smooth color.,5
"You know, just the best music app.",5
Love this app i hear Any Sound,5
I want it to enable us to skip songs with no ads,1
Spotify double charged me for a year and a half and I didn't notice. One month last year they charged me 4 times on the same day. I canceled my subscription in November 21 and they continued to charge me. The only reason I noticed any of it was because I was looking through my transaction history. I am not impressed and will definitely be deleting my account. Not to mention I've been going back and forth with the customer service representative for days. They do not have a phone number either.,1
this is great app. Low monthly fee without ads. Any music can be found,5
It a nice app...it has useful notifications plus the lyrics when the song is playing it good app...it not giving me problems I like it,5
"I've used Spotify for seven years I believe and the only issues I had were on my old phone when it would tell me my playlist wasn't downloaded when it was then when I got wifi again, it went back to saying it was downloaded. That's the only issues I've had.",4
Needs improvement on internet connection,2
user interface deteriorating after each update. deserves less than one star,1
Got me through the boring and tedious days of school also it helps me sleep at night. Over all the service it provides is phenomenal.,5
a friend at work who told me about Spotify I recently downloaded it and I LOVE SPOTIFY it's the BEST MUSIC PLAYING APP I've ever seen or used in ALL my life I deleted iHeart and Pandora because this is so GREAT AND FANTASTIC because I can save entire albums of my Favorite Rock and Country bands I Truly Love to listen to whenever wherever I want there's nothing better than Spotify in my Opinion for Good I REALLY LOVE SPOTIFY,5
Only some of the music one wants to listen to are available,4
Lotta ads but perfect otherwise.,4
Love that I can find and play all my favorite music,5
"Easy to navigate have always had the artist I asked for, reliable",5
i love this app. i have been with Spotify for over 10 years.,5
I tried downloading podcast episodes to listen to offline and then Spotify wouldn't work without Internet so there was no point in downloading the episodes,1
It makes listening to Joe Rogan a painful experience. It resets on me and I have to find my spot atleast four times a podcast. The only conceivable reason to use Spotify is the Joe Rogan contract. Iheart radio and youtube music are superior in every way. The only way it could be worse was if it crashed on startup.,1
Spotify used to be a brilliant app and I have always enjoyed listening music on it but this new update is simply pathetic. It is now only usable for premium users. Non premium cannot even listen to the music of their own choice without shuffle. I cannot rewind or repeat the song and have to bear the playlist I don't want to listen.,1
"Quality is good, but there are so many commercials! I want to workout with music, but the interruption mess up my workout.",3
"Stops playback on the paid version, every other song or so ...mid song it stops, that's how I know to update the app! After the new update, I restarted my phone and it continues to stop.",1
Good app. Very impressed with it,5
"App not working after last update, it's automatic stop to playing song and out",1
"Good but not enough, there is a lot of trouble when you are conected to other devices through the website or even from my mobile device, some issue with connection to music library and the app is not able to play any song for a long time-frame, already update and reinstalled the app, but is the same issue and then suddenly starts working again",3
Fairly simple to use but for some reason occasionally the equaliser function goes a bit wonky and stops working.,4
"It's chock full of ads, other streaming services are much better in that aspect. Every one to two songs there are two 30 seconds ads.",1
Worst app ever...i purchased premium duo twice to listen song with my friends.. In mobile app it show your package is active and in web it say no package purchase.. are you guys high or what? If you want free money just beg. Don't make stupid app's or just for once fix the issues.,1
"Did the update but downloaded music had to re download again so I pay $9.99 a month just to download music each month is not worth the $9.99 anymore not a good app to use anymore you lost my subscription,.",1
"I am going to rant how annoying this app is. First off on mobile it auto shuffles Playlists and it's annoying when I have them perfectly made. Second when I play albums to Bands it won't play the album songs in order nor have them complete, it will have some album songs and than shuffle in and other songs, so I generally have to make a Playlist just for the album (which will shuffle on mobile). Third it's algorithm doesn't hit as hard as Youtube's for finding new Bands/Albums.",1
"The app gives free users no freedom, unlike the computer version.",2
Installed bit won't even open. Checked online it takes my credentials and credit card details but won't log me in in the app. Great.,1
I did't get contnue music of any playlist and i have to choose music. So plz solve this,3
"Love it, my daughter enjoys a lot❤️",5
Excellent music appication in this world,5
Most useful app..👍we can listen whatever we want to listen...all types of songs available in this app..fabulous 👍❤,5
"Great, but can't skip when I wanna 😟",4
Cool app but some songs are no loaded,4
"The app is really faulty offline. Even though I have downloaded my playlists, they still don't load when I'm not connected to the internet. I have to close and reopen the app at least 2 or 3 times.",3
Songs all are better. But they dont give importance to kannada songs like other language songs. So thats why i am giving 2 star,2
Podcast still not available,5
Hey can you add the feature to move songs up and down in a playlist trust me it gets frustrating when you cannot play your favourite songs one after other when you add new songs. The desktop version has it so why the smartphone doesn't have the feature. If you add the feature 5 stars from me.,4
Spotify>apple music Premium is hella worth it,5
Got great music on there but the app tends to control the user on what to listen to... Not Cool!!,3
Still thinking more serious about Premium..,2
"I can't even play 3 songs without the app crashing every 10-15 minutes. It's getting really frustrating. I'm a Premium member, but it feels like I paid the subscription for Nothing🙄",1
This makes you feel better when you are not feeling ok means when you are sad it can easily make you happy by songs. There are also sad songs but it is very satisfying app. I like it very much. After downloading this app you will be very happy. Thanks for makin this app.,5
"Have been using this app for years, just recently it took away the option of hearing snippets of songs when making playlists, which was one of the things that made it a superior music app. If that option were to come back it would definitely be a five-star experience!",4
"I love spotify and what it does, however, the app is super slow. Especially when you first open it up on laptop or phone. & the link for creating blends doesnt work...!!!",3
"It's really good ☺️ ,but i just wish we could download music instead of listening 🎧",4
The music is awesome!😁😁😁,5
It's really a good app I love it coz it doesn't contain alots of ads,5
"Generally works great. But many times I've used the app the screen freezes, or control bar desappears and I need to quit app for it to appear again. Also, doesn't work well while traveling with google maps directions... it attempts to share screen and map doesn't work well",4
Love to listening music it makes my day to make me more confidence to think in positive and make plan for my future 😊😊,5
"Wonderful experience, you guys should provide an avenue to download and listen offline. It will help a lot",4
Upload Connection Error Log,1
"It's a brilliant app for streaming musics, listening to songs, podcasts and audiobooks, stories etc..",5
"Spotify used to connect automatically to my Pioneer head unit in my truck but that functionality stopped back in February I believe. I've been holding out hope that it would be fixed but so far it hasn't. My device used to show up automatically in the Windows app regardless if i had Spotify open on my phone or not, but that stopped at the same time. Audio quality and auto-generated playlists aren't as good as other streaming services. Update: they fixed it, and then broke it again. Shame!",1
Very good app easy to use great variety of music 🎶 I listen to my music all day.,5
It is amazing that you can listen to music and not get hacked on your account,5
"Its really amazing 😍 Such a wonderful experience on this music streaming app, love it",5
so amazing app I feel relaxe after listening the music from spotify,5
"I Will Give 3 Star On This App. Because Some Little Issues In This App. Like Ads, Network Loading, Premium Etc. I Will Request To The Owner. Please Fix The Little Problem. Bit This App Is Really Nice. And All The Songs Are Available On This App.",3
Beat app ever... Thank you I enjoyed alot...,5
"I found the app OK on consoles and pc but on phone the standards slip, it plays the songs on my playlist but when its done it plays songs that they added to my playlist and doesn't go back (yes I did turn off the autoplay button)",3
It's a great app but I wish I could download music,3
Not good having problems logging in,5
I really enjoy this app . It's great listening to so many different genre 😌,5
Randomly starts playing ads (not even music) when I'm sleeping. Deleting this annoying app. And youtube music is much better!,1
I love the many varieties of music and no commercials! I recommend this app to everyone!,5
Really a stupid app. It asks for logging in when sometimes I have enabled offline mode and i go out of internet. I mean i enabled offline mode so i cud play without internet right?,1
Easy to use and you can find any tunes you want,5
Huge variety of songs... Great sound quality,4
It's annoying because it stops playing in the middle of a song. Sometimes only 5 seconds into a song. Fix it!,1
"it is easy to get on this app. and alot of music that i like. it works real good, no problems.",5
"It tells me 30 mins no ad music and while im working out 10 mins later an ad,false advertising",2
Good Music Sound Quality,5
"Spotify is fine except when ur a free listener. It gives u limited skips, adds random songs to your Playlist, gives u ad after ad after ad, and it just ruins the whole app. I will no longer be using spotify",1
Wonderful app for music lovers♥️,5
The best Music Application.,5
"I like the playlists, I like the amount of songs and artists. I absolutely HATE the free version as you basically have no control over choosing songs or playlists anymore and you get 2 songs and 4 ads. You're being forced into paying for the subscription because they make it annoying enough. I'd rather go to YouTube or Amazon music.",1
"I have not had a problem with this app until now, It just updated about a week ago and I found that all my playlists in app were empty. And spotify made playlists were too. Nothing will play. And on the web player everything is normal. I tried this newest update, just a moment ago and nothing is fixed. Good job. 👍",2
"Good app, but yall made a terrible decision removing the preview button. Who thought that was a good idea?? “Oh, yeah. It would be a great idea removing the preview button so others cant find new songs”💀 I cant even find new songs to add to my playlist because of that. What was the point of removing it? Add it back, please. Also, I hate how you guys add random songs to my playlist while im listening, I never asked for that. But seriously, please add the preview button back.",1
"This app is great, the music is great although there is one problem, the app is messed up, like when I try to play the song I try to play it just shuffles to the song I don't even wanna play, it's fricking annoying and it's so annoying I wanna smash my phone so hard just because of the music I wanna play, please add ""Shuffle off"" button so I can shut this thing off, I really wanna play ""Bubble gum"" by Clario.",1
Best clear song app but app sound slow please fix thoda,5
Greatest app ever for streaming songs,5
Very bad need to listen to a song but it is only contains add add add add add add add add add,1
Good. But it can only connect to my boom box for short time.,4
Best app just please a little lesser adds and some good songs aren't there which isn't good but overall alright,5
Best with ads,5
It is very good it lets me pick my music,5
Amazing app best app for music 🎶,5
Nice collection of classical songs.Easy to search.Few ads than youtube.,5
"The song which will not be found anywhere, it will be found here, it is a good app.",5
I've enjoyed varieties of music from the app.,4
Only thing I use to stream any music. Had the paid for version but had to cut it as I couldn't afford it any more.,4
Audio quality is exceptional,5
Excellent Online Music Platform....... And it also needs some improvements... Overall I loved it....,4
"Ads are fine but please, please let me choose a song",1
"Amazing that this app has been out for almost a decade and there is still no way to organize your music library by genre. You also can't collaborate on playlist with a specific user, so get ready for bots to put random songs on your collaborative playlists. The app doesn't run well on new phones or old phones. Artists don't get compensated fairly and the CEO is a war profiteer. I'm switching to Tidal, which means I'll lose years worth of playlists, but it's definitely worth it.",1
It's a great app for music lovers! Would recommend this.,5
To difficult to turn app off. Considering uninstalling,3
"If you ain't paying for it, might as well go screw your self. It gets worse as the months go by. I only use the god awful app for 1 flipping podcast, and i have to un-reinstall 10x/podcast. Can't wait for Rogan to move platforms",1
Why does every other app in my phone have a better audio quality than Spotify..........? And I have a premium account I often wonder if I should cancel and just get YouTube music.,1
Organized well thought out music service,5
Ahhhhhhhhhh I think Spotify is the best approach when it comes to listen full full album,5
"Well, I've been using the Amazon Music app that is about ten dollars a month. Spotify is way more up my alley. Lots easier to populate your lists. Helpful suggestions. High bit rate sounds great! The thing is, I'm listening to classical music.",5
"The new update sucks. It won't actually let me listen to my playlists anymore. I made a new playlist this morning and instead of letting me listen to it, it started playing the recommended songs and there's no way that I've been able to find to make it stop. There's also no way to turn off shuffle. It won't let you click on specific songs in your playlist anymore and the daily skips have lowered by a lot. Did I use up a free trial of premium or something? Because I did not sign up for one.",1
New update are so trash lmao only 6 skip per hour ? This is music app or game ???? We use to listen why you don't let me chose a song that i want to listen ??,3
After last update there is a problem in chrome cast please fix it,4
Busted for 2 days now. Playlist won't load.,1
Everytime an ad comes on it dosen't make me want to get premium. It almost always makes me want to delete my account.,2
"I don't know if y'all would answer the solution for this, but I've been utilizing this music source for nearly 2 years now, had enjoyed every single thing until the last update. Firstly, lot of songs I've played recently depicted a whole different track or album's cover, which made me hard to distinguish what song is. Secondly, specifically lastly, why do some songs have a lag, even if I've downloaded it? I've never experienced this before. Please fix this immediately.",3
It's a good app and has all of music I would want but when I first downloaded it I had to immediately update because the app wouldn't even open.,4
Love this app !!! Can pick my favorite songs and enjoy whenever I want to!!! ❤ and thanks to the Spotify team 😀,5
Why are you turning off my video when I put it in Bluetooth mode absolutely stupid! You're lucky you're getting one star,1
Awesomene selection of music 🎶 love it,5
Alot of good playlists for your needs,5
Thanks Spotify. Amazing experience,5
"I don't know Spotify, I'm a little confused why I can't download even though my account is premium, I've deleted the important ones but still can't help fix this application I'm a bit disappointed.",3
"Love all the Playlist I can create, the variety of content and the ease of using this app.",5
I love Spotify I was an apple music subscriber not anymore,5
I'm starting to think Amazon music better suits me. They play what I like without me choosing,3
This platform is really awesome but premium is little bit higher In price so that yt music is more Better option than that because of affordable price with video features and minimal primium range one premium for everyone .,4
Enjoy the largest collection of music with excellent quality and inbuilt adjustments of the app,4
When I go on to my play list it will play a completely different song so can you change that thanks,5
Too much ads. Sometimes feel like to deleating it.,3
Absolutely awesome....surely a must have app,5
WORST APP I EVER USED!. I always want to play my songs but it never let's me! Like what the frick. This Is why I think Amazon music is better and simple. This is the worst app ever.,1
"I'm a premium user. When playing downloaded songs offline the app will suddenly stop or crash even if the phone screen is on. This has been for a long time and i have been praying that an update will fix this. After many updates, however, the issue persist. The same issue was experienced in the phones of my wife and daughter. Please resolve this once and for all. We are paying for premium just to play our songs offline and this persisting issue is not fair to us.",1
Basically Spotify is ruin sincr it wont even let you choose a song now it only play it for few second and then you only can skip 6 times per hour it just suck at this point 👎,1
"I've been using Spotify for years but I can't even log in anymore. The login system is completely messed up, you could log in using your email or Facebook on the web interface as both are connected to each other. The app version doesn't work like this, it straight up denies my email. You just simply cannot use your email to log in through the app if you made the account using your Facebook. The Facebook login is also broken for months now, the page says that the embedded page is down. Fix this!",1
It's good for playing your fave tracks for free if you don't mind the interuption of adds every so often. 👍,4
"Usually I love this app, and I've been paying for premium for years, but this most recent update is messing everything up. The app just downright refused to work yesterday, no matter what I did. It's working slightly better today but still randomly stopped working on my morning drive to work which wasn't super convenient. Please fix the bugs from the latest update!",3
Best music app. Dont believe what others say try it then decide.,5
Mobile version navigation is AWFUL,2
"So many bugs, always crashing. Premium isn't worth it anymore",1
"It's wonderful app, very nice tamil songs collection",5
All the music I like in one easy to navigate app,5
"From like 2 or 3 months, this app is not working well and whenever I try to listen any songs,podcast and episodes, it shows that go to home page ! And I'm requesting you to please fix this bug or glitch as soon as possible 🙏",1
Having problem evey time when I try to login and some times show network error in search section. Please solve these problems 😒 And there is too many adds.,4
Spotify is all and more than I could want for my musical exploration and enjoyment.,5
You'll love it! A whole wide variety of music that can be found!!!,5
So nice but if you can just make it easier to search the songs thanks😁,5
Worst music app can't play music that I want,1
Very good variety. Only complaint is repetition of some songs when there is a comprehensive playlist,4
"On my old phone (Xiaomi Mi 8), the equaliser worked perfectly fine. Now, on my Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro, it doesn't work at all. Please fix this.",5
This good sound..lovabail aap good experience in the sound of the day of yourself and you are not able to be a dark life of you and your family is good and I love this good sound,3
Lots of ads 😥,3
"Hi ,I'm an android phone user and everytime I put a song it pits a random that I hate. I have to delete it and install it again and after 5 days it does the same bug",1
Love making playlists,5
"Caters to my music tastes, and gives similar bands to choose from. I like this app, can't believe I was so against it in the first place. It even let's me make my own playlists, easier than YouTube premium for sure.",5
"i would'av given a 5*, but since i'm relatively new to the spotify scene , i thought it disingenuous , there's always room for improvement in anything we do.., keep up the good work, and i might, this review, to edit, come back. 😉",4
"It's makes my life funner. Enhances my fun mode. It also brings joy to my friends and others 😊. Thank you for the service you provide. Heads up, you're better than pandora.",5
No interruption from ads but a decent price as well as their bundles for family it's really good I recommend you to listen to music from here,5
"It's okay so far, but not being able to listen to downloads offline is weird. All in all it's been excellent",5
It's great to find music u like even though the ads are disturbing your mood 🙂,5
"Dum dum and I wanted to play a specific song and it gives me a whole random playlist which sucks, at least have a setting or something developers. 😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬 Geez now I have to use YouTube music 🎶",1
Nice and all but there's quite a lot of updates?,4
Great options for all platforms of music,5
THE AD SAY U WILL NOT GET ANY ADVERTISEMENT UNTIL 30 MIN BUT I GET AFTER EVERY 3 MINUTES I AM DELETING THE APP 💩,2
"I've been using this app for years, and it had never failed me.",5
"Any song I search for Spotify delivers, awesome",5
Nice music app ever used..,5
Spotify thinks there slick running adds after every two songs,2
Its an amaizing app. I love listening to music on it and i font get any adds.,5
"Great App, but facing advertisements after every song on both my PC and my phone. Please lower the number of advertisements so that people who haven't brought premium also enjoy uninterrupted music for a limited time. For example: After an advertisement we can listen to uninterrupted music for 30 minutes or less or After ever 5 songs an advertisement will be played and after that we can listen to 5 more songs uninterrupted. Hope you take this in consideration. Thanks",3
It could be a great app if commercials wouldn't yell in your ear when you try to listen to some music after every 3 songs. I understand that a free version can't work as paid one but this is ridiculous and extremely annoying,2
I was very sattisfied from spotify until it started lagging whenever it felt like it not letting me listen to music. I have contacted customer service and nothing they suggested helped the situation. This has been going on for more than 2 weeks. If it doesn't get fixed I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go with apple music.,1
"I like it . But here is one issue . I just want eng subtitles under the Korean or Chinese song lyrics. Eng subtitles are available in Samsung phone . So please, I'll be thankful if you clear this issue .",5
That is very good song lestining app.,5
"I would like the paid version of this app to be available without commercials. Yes, the music is ad free, but the podcasts are not. Can you edit these out, please! 5 stars if you do.",2
"I am a Premium user but cannot play music when offline, though I downloaded the songs. And the app is always crashing. Kindly fix these issues. Thanks.",1
This is a must have if you enjoy ad free music.,5
This app is really good 😊 because you can even turn off the phone while playing it and doesn't give me any problem or errors it give us a very good 😊 service 💯✨🤝,5
"Very good app for listening songs,news,bhajans,prodcasts etc .",5
Why is the social feature still broken? I loved seeing what all my friends were listening to and discovering new music that way. Please fix it and make it a more prominent feature.,3
"I usually love this app but just in the past week or so, that problem of constant stopping mid-song randomly is back. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone and just did an update of the app this morning and still nothing. It's so frustrating that I'm using Pandora and YouTube instead, which is annoying because I pay for Spotify. If this isn't fixed quickly, I'm cancelling my subscription!",2
Lots of ads,1
"""Local"" songs get flagged as unplayable constantly, they dropped support for Kenwood / JVC head units, it uses far more data than it has any right to, syncs terribly and requires a lot of fuffing around to do basic functions. There's not much there worth your time - they've gotten the user base, and now they're complacent and no longer care about making the user experience any good.",1
I'll give a 5 stars if you can finally let me share lyrics on instagram.... THANKS! 5 STARS NOW,5
I wish to download songs to play offline but i cant,3
Such and amazing app I love it❤️ literally being used every day.,5
Whenever I try to listen to a curtain song it plays a different one and also when I log on it makes me watch ads,1
Poeple are missing a great app,5
"I have been living with problems with Spotify and paying for it since February and they still haven't fix my problems. I'm told my case had been passed on to their executive level tech support, but they can't give me a date when my problem will be fixed or it it will be fixed at all. I haven't heard from anyone executives tech yet, it's 4/11/2020. Spotify don't care about their customers. They are only concerned with getting your money. I lost track of how many emails I have sent seeking help.",1
"'Hey slow down you have only 6 in one hour"" is rude. I should not receive that when I have not subscribed",1
"It's a very very good application for listening songs, podcasts, etc. I enjoyed very much with it. This is a special music listening application because it give us the freedom to make our own privet or public playlist. It's amazing.",5
Terrible experience on mobile.,1
When I want to play my liked songs it instead play another song and when I play a song it's only for a while I hope it's fixed,2
"Very bad, o can't download to play offline. Why is that? At least I should be able to download to the App and play offline in the App. I am not enjoying it as I thought",2
You should try this app there is alot of beautiful song that you can listen all day and you can make playlist for music you like then shill with it all night 😎,5
Lot of ads,1
Spotify is great!,5
Used to work great! Now it won't load the homescreen and freezes all the time!,1
Awesome app with almost all songs available from,5
"Spotify is a good app to listen to music however it forces you to pay like nothing will function, I'm willing to pay it's not a big deal however my experience wasn't good while I didn't pay so I don't think it's worthy to pay for.",1
"All the songs that we paid till date should be ours not that app should just remove access from it, if we don't pay.",5
A great platform to listen to some great content.,5
I love the music but I can't stand the bug that will just keep skipping tracks randomly until I restart the entire app. Pretty hard to do that whole driving,3
Cool app for us retired old geirzers,4
Making 1 star until spotify removes their own ads from podcasts. The tone shift completely ruins them.,1
Best app using it from a long time but there's recently some issues. The song gets stops in the middle and suddenly it plays. It just hinders the joy of music. There's no issue with the network. I hope you'll consider my problem and work on it asap. Rest it's the best app for music...,4
Low ratings seem to come from the people who dont pay for it so... ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ -paid customer,5
"personally for me, this is the best music app out there. Automix, recommendations are top notch",5
Great to use for excercise,5
Too many ads and less skips,2
This app is the best app I think for listening music.....join premium and get uninterrupted music and have fun🤗🤗,5
Delivers the music I want but at the expence of artists who receive little revenue from this service! ☹️,3
Too many ads,1
"Spotify is very good app to listen music. Ads are fine even though it is irritating sometimes. But lyrics are not correct for most of the Tamil songs. It's all in Romanized version and spellings and pronounciation are wrong for everything. I suggest you to give lyrics for Tamil songs in Tamil like how you give the original lyrics for other language songs. It will be more appreciated. Thank you. Otherwise, Spotify is very good app.",4
I love this app Spotify is very very good app 🤗🤗💜💜💜🖤💖🖤💝,5
"Outstanding. No more carrying external hard drives, hybrid hard drives, solid state drives or memory sticks. The playlist you do for one is spot on.",5
"It played 4 ads at once. Fix this issue. If this is intentional, please stop.",4
Was an amazing app now I can't loop any song,1
"is it just me or not, after got 3 update my audio quality always like got stabbed by a knife. thats hurting my ears.",5
I love this app but.... why can free acc can't turn off the shuffle? I really hate this update for my opnions!!,3
"Excellent app for Music, great playlist recommendations",5
Spotify gives the best feeling ❤️💯,5
"Pros: Great listening experience, lots of connectivity options. Very useful autogwnerated playlists, discover weekly and most listened songs throughout the last year. Cons: Could offer more quality options for pasionate users.",5
"No other music service compares, Premium is worth every penny if not more. The people who are complaining about the free side and giving low ratings don't seem to understand the potential in this service, Spotify has made small artists around the world more accessible than ever before. They've made a service where you can blend your own music tastes with people close to you to get a custom playlist updated daily based on your common music tastes. They're bringing people together wity music. 🤘",5
Its good but when now the daily mix is on shuffle.. please make the daily mix playlist not shuffle again : ),4
An utterly broken app. Anytime I try to listen to anything it tells me I'm not connected to the Internet. If I try to download anything it just shuts down. Piece of shite 🥴,1
"the best it is not bad, I love it because it lets you make your own playlist and it lets you put what whatever songs you want on a certant playlist",5
This application is very good I highly recommend for you to listen to music while relaxing,5
"it takes too long to load when my wifi works just fine, i dont have any problems with the rest of how the app works",4
"I use premium, but j hate how unusable free is, like u can't actually specifically choose a song to play and I hate that",4
its good but after update i couldn't see the lyrics anymore..,4
Disgusting update. Too many advertising,1
"Asife from the exorbitant amount of bugs (music not playing, controlling other devices only works half the time, etc.), There's several missing features like a proper shuffle (or a switch for it), themes and proper folder support (how hard can it be? It's already mostly implemented). Also, when playing a radio, the shuffle button isn't shown but it does still apply to the queue.",1
So many ads i went to listen 1.50 minute song but i had to listen 1 minutes 9f ads what the worth gaana is better the you im shifting,1
Ever since I stopped using premium it's been being kinda odd like the format like bro spotify u got favriotes or something 🤔,3
I gave it 4 stars because 1. Ot doesn't pay for the usage of artists songs but I also gave it 4 stars becuade it has Mr. Ballen podcast on it and he's the king of true crime stories,4
"i started using this app over pandora back in 2013? Only beause you could make playlists, thats it. I love listening to music but this app has more ads than before. I get that ads make the world go round, but why so many like 3-4 in a row and after every other song. I hear more ads than music on this app anymore. Instead of jamming out to music i am now jamming out to ads about tourism in the same state i live in!! Atleast YT lets you skip an ad.",2
Wow! This app is extremely perfect I am wondered by this app features I am wishing Spotify team get more profits!,5
"There's this one really annoying feature - let's say I listened to Album A yesterday. I pause it at some point during song X and stop listening. The next day, I choose Album B. When the first song from Album B is over, it plays song X again, and then goes back to playing the rest of Album B. Whyyyyy????",3
Love the music in Spotify!!!,5
I just love this bcz Spotify have all the BTS songs that's why I love Spotify,5
"Used Spotify for years upon years without the need of any membership. The ads are short, don't come up too often and sometimes have good songs in them so they're not an issue. I'm able to make my own playlists, save as many songs as I like to my liked list and can skip / change songs any time I want until the next ad pops up which is completely reasonable. Used Spotify on PC, Ps4 and Mobile, which all link togther, for the best experience and to get the most out of what it has to offer.",5
"Its worst app because add comes after 1 or 2 songs everytime they say that buy premium for no ads but i had given 2 stars bcz it have almost all songs and we can use it while using another app , please dont give too many ads do it after 30 minutes once...",2
"The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because adding multiple songs to a playlist is slow and awkward. Aside from that, I love it.",4
This would be a five but every time I make a play list it playes one that I want and then changes my whole Playlist to the worst music ever.. can you just let me listen to my music and not your weird music,1
Easy to use and still free,5
Every time I asked for a song it was there!!,5
This app used to play music for me from my playlists or just by simple searching now it plays either adverts or a small sample of my song not the entire thing safe to say unless they update that to change it back I won't be using Spotify again,1
Delivers all our music and podcast requirements,5
"This app takes to much Mega Byte (MB) that's why I have given three stars to this app, If there would be any other issue or this problem will be fixed so I will edit my post again So fix this problem Thanks",3
Ever since i moved to india the app wont let me login at all - and i was on the premium tier. Gone are all my playlists and downloads. Not a good experience and its such a bummer because i spent so much time categorising all of my favorites :(,1
"The update is horrible, it kept playing random songs even tho it's not on my playlist and whenever I pick a song to play it will play a random song before playing the song that I pick usually its just an ad then the song that you pick. For me before the update is more better.",2
Hacked and constant crashes,1
"Now spotify has stopped working completely. In place of fixing the issue, they are increasing the issue. No Internet connection is displayed even with a 200 MBPS stable connection.",1
The app are good but if I play my favorite song it's play's wrong song,2
This app was good at first but then it started giving prblms. I couldnt play songs i like. It started to suffle and show only playlists which i ddnt even ask for. Fix ur app plz,1
This has to be the best app ever made because the sound quality and availability of songs on this app remains unmatchable,4
good but i hope they lessen the ads and let us listen in offline without premium,5
Wow is a understatement. Easy to work with. Very good motivational talks. Interactions with my car and other Bluetooth devices is fantastic. Thank you,5
Please add voice search option in spotify and add video songs,3
Love it best for music by far,5
"Resuming podcast episodes is kinda broken. You'll be halfway through an episode, click play to resume, go through a few ads, and instead of resuming the episode you're on it starts playing the next episode. Every. Time.",1
Best application for listening songs i have ever seen,5
Very good music app,5
Almost have every songs nd new enhanced feature is gud for finding new songs of ur types,5
Ads make no sense,5
Yar everything ok but their are many adds,5
I will giving three stars to spotify because it's a amazing app. Clear sound and esy to find songs.,3
I enjoy listening to music. This is the best music app to find.,5
"I used to love this app, now it makes you pay for basic needs. Spotify is so money hungry you cant skip songs, and it adds other songs when youre trying to listen to a singular song. It adds songs you dont want into a playlist.",1
Constant glitches and playback problems. You can offer me free months til the cows come home. This app is garbage.,1
I can say this the best music app Much love Spotify,5
"I am unable to play music its showing every playlist as "" playlist is empty"" even in explore option nothing is playing in spotify not podcast not songs its all blank",1
Ads are more frequent,3
I am using a friend's family plan and getting free premium essentially.,5
There is limited skips and you can't play the song you want just shuffle,1
"I absolutely love it, it has everything you can really need when it comes to music. And it 100% deserves a five stars.",5
"Really this app is too good, I like it so much. If you want to listen song according to your choice yet, this app is favorable for you. But there are some issues also while using this app.",2
I LOVE this app so much because I love music and I love kpop,5
Very nice sound quality is amazing,4
W music app if you just get premium. Just get it bro it's goated.,5
Spotify is better than ganna because it's very difficult to find songs in ganna app and spotify is very easy to use and you can find any playlist in it quickly so i suggest you to download only spotify app ☺☺☺☺,5
Plz fix the bug. Even after disabling the automix and gapless features still the music is getting automix and is playing gapless Not expected from spotify. Will immediately shift to other apps if the problem is not solved and reverted back. Disgusting bug.,3
"Love spotify (if u pay for it lol) I would suggest adding an option to the sleep timer to stop at ""end of queue"" rather than time",5
Love the playlists I can make and goes with me wherever I go.,5
"I love everything about Spotify. Even the free version is amazing. The ability to organize the playlists, favourite songs, and just the overall presentation are perfect.",5
"Didn't have any problem with free trial version. Until I subscribed to premium since 2 years ago and the lyrics won't show up in any device idk why. Tried reinstalling, updating, clearing cache for MONTHS. Nothing works..",5
Awesome feature everything is good,5
The problem is just when l play my favorite song it choose an random song is so annoying then when l search it it still put random song even l restart like what if u can fix it then fix it!,2
I will try to play my playlist and it will automatically play random different songs that i never even added.,1
I listened to music streaming,5
Some songs doesn't show lyrics even though they used to show before.. please fix it,4
"Very good, but I'd love to be able to see a Top 20 All-time most popular for every artist with the total amount of plays.",5
Very music playlists make the app...and listen too enjoyed,1
"It was a decent application with a lot of advertisement. Less gigabits needed for quick music listening in the background. The premium feature isn't even comparable to YouTubes version, since it is often more expensive for less content and sometimes the advertisement can longer, since you can't skip there and all ads r 30sec.",4
"The app is saying all my Playlist are empty and won't let my listen to anything at all? Keeps saying ""try again"" and even after clicking that button it doesn't work.",2
Bring the Settings icon back to the home screen. Why confuse android users with it being hidden in the profile section?,1
"Really nice App, I thoroughly enjoying it, 👍",5
"I love it. My music doesn't get put on hold for any ads, it's the best app ever. No regrets.",5
Recent updates ruined it. 5 ads for every 3 songs,1
"Its alright I guess. Not bad, but I would prefer YouTube music over Spotify..",5
Every one song 2/3 adds it's irritating,1
I don't know how one of the biggest music companies in the world can't seem to figure out how to make their app work consistently. Your app is garbage. It only works 25% of the time. I can never pick up a podcast where I left off if I'd like to switch to music for a couple hours. Sometimes I can't even get the Podcast or music to PLAY. For a company this big... This apps performance is unacceptable.,1
I love the app but sometimes it like get me another song.,4
I used spend hours in this app but since two days is ca causing so badly that the moment I play any song the app is automatically getting closed.,5
Great selection of all music 🎵,5
This app has all my favorite songs and podcast on it,5
What happened now? I can't play my favorite songs in my playlist? How disappointing..,1
Excellent collection. Good quality.,4
I Really Love What I Get From Spotify And It Has The Best Music That I Would Tell People To Join Spotify,5
As a subscriber I enjoy the wide variety of songs and music available. It's a great service.,5
I don't mind the ads that I've grown use to. Like living near an airport; engines get annoying. But listen for the music and cancel out the rest and you'll be alright.,5
It's good but my problem is you can't play the music that you search properly it's like you play a song you press the play button and sometimes it plays a different music and if you play your playlist you can only play it in shuffle you can't play it the way you intended to and it has ads if you really want to use it without the ads you can play music properly etc then get the premium,1
I like new music and the old music and all other music different backgrounds thanks,4
I love Spotify playlist and music. I always get can find something to listen to.😃,5
Sometimes it doesn't really let me go out of i think it's werid,3
It's a good app for listening to music but the automatic shuffle is annoying and the songs and they added that I didn't want to my playlist,2
Add some more advertisements so we can enjoy your advertisements without playing the songs,1
What the heck happened to 30 minutes of ad free music??? Now we get 2 songs than some ads.... you basically NEED premium to enjoy this app now,1
This srsly keep getting in my nerves mostly if songs different songs are playing wich arent even in my playlist!!,1
"I don't mind the ads appearing too often, but I don't like the automatic selection of the background colors for your own playlists or profile. Sometimes it picks the right color; sometimes it's just plain gray. Perhaps there should be an option to customize our profile and playlist background colors?",5
Terrible. Seems I can only shuffle songs at random and not listen to the playlists I want. I believe this change is new and it was a bad one. If there is some way to turn this off I still think my review would be low because it is not very intuitive.,1
For me the app is a little irratating. Doesnt always show on my playing now. I have to close out and reopen for it fof the app to catch up when i switch from one pod cast to the next.,3
Gud. Why is it soo big for a music player tho?,5
"Wonderful experience, vary easy to operate. Without distraction we can use it. Clarity is good.",5
The app is good but it says that there will not be another ad in 30 minutes but there is an ad in like four songs.,4
Absolutely recomend its an amazing app but one problem is the ads its alaway that same stupid add about northern kentucky unitversity damn that stupid place,5
the apps becoming unusable the music's always stuttering and I fear years of loyalty will come to an end. I'll switch to Apple music.,1
Great music app thats all i got to say :),5
It's the best music app so far.,5
"Great music, app sucks. Closes all the time. Makes you start podcast from the beginning. Freezes up often. Super liberal as well, so some things you search for aren't available.",2
Easy listening Easy to find great music,5
Long time user. Great app and great service! Request: please bring back the Spotify third-party extension store.,5
"Used it a couple times but I don't like the fact you only get limited skips, and you can't choose a song whenever you want. I use YouTube music now and its way better than this app. I would rather watch a 30 second ad then not choose my favorite song. Do you agree or disagree?",2
I can't choose the songs I want to listen to,1
Overall a great app. I don't recommend casting to tv.,4
It makes sound sometimes,4
Nice selection of music and them stories U share . Thanks for the music it's easier than in 1970' seeking music.,4
"Favorite music app, no contest.",5
"Literally will not work at all, nothing plays, playlists give an error apon opening them, asked Spotify about it and still nothing worked, nothing works no matter how hard I try or what I do",1
Spotify is THE BEST!,5
"It used to be a 5 star app but, now there are too many adds consecutively. You can listen to 2 songs and then you gotta listen like 4 adds......its disgusting.",1
"At least, let us skip it without limit. Some people are poor and can't afford to pay.",2
"Better than Pandora, but still lacking. Recent updates make it so you can't preview songs before adding to your playlists, which is frustrating. The recommended songs in playlists are now mostly songs that are already on your playlist, super helpful. Hopefully bugs that will be fixed in 6-9 months (sarcasm, but is it?)",2
Love that it is simple to use. Love all the choices. Now I listen to podcasts too. I'm 65 and was nervous about using but I love it!!,5
Okay but not great there are limited skips and it also makes Playlists for you and in general its an okay music app would recommend pandora though,2
"Pretty cool,but sometimes i ain't able to listen to all the songs",5
Best streaming app imo!,5
Worst experience with ads! Switching to prime music,1
Very simple and the connection with the car es great,5
Lovely choices on music,5
This app is outstanding in music,5
10/5 professional Spotify dickrider here. I come in my pants every time I open the app.,5
My experience with Spotify is really awesome! The thing I most like about Spotify is the 'daily playlist' that really contains the songs of my choice so i don't have to do constant searching for finding songs of my taste. So for me Spotify is my daily go app for songs😊😊😊,5
"It's good but, when i played a song it keeps on changing/shuffling i cant even play my fave song! What if the other doesnt like the other song?! i keep on playing my fave song but it keeps on SHUFFLING like what the, last time when i dowloaded this to my ipad it's not even like that when i played my fave song it's not changing. I know your app is full of music but it's too restrictring, what kind of update is that soptify?! I 'm so disapointed i did everything!",1
You can't fully listen to songs anymore without having to pay,2
Very entertaining and informative. All in one app. Enjoying it 👍,5
"Too many ads, and that isn't 30 minutes, it's like ten minutes.",5
Great app. Just that so many content creators that are just reviewing content that I am actually looking for. Bothersome.,4
I love Spotify but I can't play music since updating my phone to the new update on my a10 e please sort this out I will change my review to 5 stars when iasue is fixed,3
"Please for the love of God, fix the local music player!",1
Love the songs and app!,5
Never had a issue. Best app for music lovers everywhere,5
"It is to restricting please change it, I tried playing my fav songs but it keeps playing different songs and you even need to get premium? How pathetic, I'm giving this app a 1 star it's to restricting!!😠👎",1
Below average on a consistent basis. You shouldn't have to pay for a service that has to be constantly restarted each and every time it's used. The only good thing it has going is it's variety. For an app that had millions of users it's lucky to get a rating at all.,1
Hate the fact that i need premium to get to the songs that i want to get to why cant it be like on pc where i can select any song from my playlist i would apreciate it if you would do the same here,2
"Love that i can find anysong that know if,but wish that there were no ads",5
App is insanely clunky. Keep crashing on podcasts. Pauses for no reason. Just all around annoying to use.,1
I ❤ love Spotify it helps me throughout the day,5
"I love this app but I absolutely hate that you have limited skips, and you have to shuffle to play a playlist.",2
Don't get me wrong I do like Spotify but what I really don't like about it is that it adds songs to your Playlist and some of the songs that they put on there are inappropriate songs that I don't want to listen to I hope this gets changed😮‍💨😔😪,2
Love Spotify! I never have any issues! My favorite music platform!,5
I love Spotify ❤️ my phone got disconnected and I was lost without it.,5
Excellent service thank you Spotify,5
Absolutely useless for uploading your music when it doesn't really track all the accounts because when I put my account name in. It's says their isn't even an account in the first place.,1
"Zero stars really should be an option. Functions most poorly when not connected. Is it a ""streaming"" service? Some paying customers live in areas with low, slow, and unreliable coverage. Unacceptable, for a paid service. Update, still terrible.",1
Keeps pausing randomly when I'm playing music out loud. Every few minutes! Then when I unlock my phone it starts again. 😡😡,1
It's easy to use. An you can lesion to all your favorite bands,5
Have used this app for years very good quality. Could use more new ways to find new music.,5
I have the Spotify app downloaded on my galaxy watch 4. Everytime the screen times out the music pauses. Any ideas on how to fix this?,1
Spotify thank you your #1.,5
"I have never taken to this app. I like to own a physical version of my favourite music. Ive gone back to buying Cds. If someone hadn't sold my albums id go straight back to viynal too. Hate ""steaming""",1
Really good quality of music better then SoundCloud,5
Play what you want when you want. It's great,5
"ads are out of control. Less ads, better app.",1
"I enjoy it. Could use a few more options, like a random shuffle play of everything you've downloaded or maybe just a surprise me Playlist of random stuff. Could be interesting. I'm just happy with no commercials.",5
Literally the only music app I can use all other ones confuse me 💀,5
I like the Spotify app but really you have to get premium to listen to any song you want no I think that's just straight up dumb. So Spotify if you read this review can you please get rid of shuffle play at least make it optional please and I'll upgrade from two stars to four stars. Since you don't want to respond I'm going to give you one star. Fix your app can't you see by the reviews that people don't like it fix your dumb app!! Maybe I might install your app but until then you lost someone.,1
For easy listening the app is great for me ..... a techno illiterate gal !,5
This app is very bad because it did not give me the songs that I want and it gives me clips for songs and not full songs for example I was looking for a song and i was not answered I really do not like this app and it does not depend on it at all and there are applications much better than it but I do not want to say its names 👎👎👎,1
Love the music and how it works ..absolutely favorite,5
Spotify is my favorite music player. Been using Spotify for 6-7 years. Its awesome!!!,5
"Best streaming platform 😍😍😍 Edited: after downloading the new update the app is pretty much useless now, can't pick the song you want to listen to, you are basically forced to listen to what they think you like, I'll search a song but I can't play it, it's frustrating. Uninstalled the app already.",1
I pay for premium and can't see joe Roman's podcast. Only works on audio no video.,1
"It has every I could want and more,and Spotify make play list that I might not have thought of. The best place for music love this app",5
Good just less ads please.,4
Great app but songs will get stuck and you can't move on from that track no matter what you do to troubleshoot. Spotify is aware of the issue that's been happening for quite some time but no fix in sight.,4
Great service. Ive had other as in Pandora etc. This by far is the BEST.,5
Buggy. Never works when I really need it to,1
Nothing seems to be working since I updated the app about an hour ago.,1
If you don't plan on getting premium I recommend skipping. A nightmare just trying to get a song to play without ads or premium push interruptions.,2
Awesome app! I just wish that out of a playlist with over 50 songs I wouldn't get 2 ads every 3 songs,3
App is good but it's constantly cutting out when playing or just stops playing songs altogether and have to reset it every time and it's not cool when using for workout music esp when I pay for premium service I expect it to work,2
"I love this app and I have premium, but the new update came and I can't find lyrics for any song and most of them had lyrics.",5
Basically my paid premium subscription is okay but the shuffle option is a joke and has been for years. Every time the only way to hear different random songs from my 800 plus library is to play songs from the start. No point asking to be fixed cause obviously it's in the too hard basket. Very disappointing.,1
I am so pleased to have Spotify to enjoy my music,5
"Lately it's been stalling on songs. One song will play just fine and the next one won't play at all not even if I move the ""timer"" myself. I've had to Uninstall the app a few times hoping that would help.",3
App has continuously gotten worse and have to unistall it frequently to get it to work,1
"New update is causing issues while reproducing music, lag",3
"Constantly glitching on mobile and Mac, been reading about the issues with music stopping at the 9 second mark, I can't believe I'm paying for a faulty app that doesn't work properly, yet they never have issues nor glitches when taking our money.",1
Too many adds and you are very restricted in what you can listen to consecutively on freeplay.,4
"Update: I swear it's like clockwork, every two weeks I have to reinstall because the app breakdown. Does anyone else have this problem? It's ridiculous and I'm getting really sick of it. (Old review) Current Version/Update: is basically unusable. It crashes constantly. I have to open and close it like 5 times before I can get it to even react to my inputs. I'm tired of reinstalling. Worst of all it's making my phone system UI crash too.",1
Spotify constantly disconnects my bluetooth. Will not play songs. Pushs for Bluetooth. Why? Why are you pushing Bluetooth? I'm a hair away from canceling. Still no blocking capability! You're up to no goof like any other platform right now.,1
Constant problems and the sound quality is extremely shotty for some stuff. Pairing with things can be a nightmare to get to work.,2
Love Really easy to use this app,5
"The music is great and overall great. But then it starts pausing music, not playing music, and crashing. Can yall please for the love of God fix these issues.",2
Too many useless ads. Also crashes frequently.,5
Always been pushy with ads and their ever increasing costs. Newest update butchered its ability to cast to any of my Google home devices... getting tired of paying more for ever decreasing quality of product.,3
"The app play keeps stopping while playing through, esp when screen shuts off, but very inconsistent all around. Really takes away from a laid back listening experience. ---- Update: last few updates (June 2020) have been doing the same thing again, but even worse. Songs will stop playing seconds after starting, have to scrub through multiple songs to get it audio to start playing again. No control over which you can play when it gets like that. Pause/play is useless",2
"Love the clarity of the music, great selection, but for the love of whichever God you may pray to, can you stop changing the way liked songs works? I personally enjoy the selected genre option, but with it taken away it is much harder to find the songs I want in liked songs. I know Playlist exist, but I find that those are minimizing to what songs I would listen to otherwise. All around, a good app, but inconsistent.",3
"Music now cuts out after 10 sec, tried a fresh install clearing data and cache prior, didn't help.",1
"The overall premise of the app is great, but there's no way to tell if your song is buffering, it just won't play. The only good part is I can download my songs so I don't have to wait for service to work, but even that can be difficult to access.",2
"Very bad experience, not working. Ask for login when it wants without any reason. Adds no matters you have the payment version. Too difficult to find one song. Please go to YouTube and enjoy!",1
Love it so easy even for me a 69 yo,5
"You all have to fix your app I can't listen to half of the songs I want too, it's always glitching or messing up something is always wrong with it",3
The only thing really bad is the ads there's way to much,3
Spotify meets my needs beautifully. Thank you.,5
For some reason won't let me play any of the songs and I pay for premium which means it comes with offline play so it shouldn't be buffering or skipping or pausing or any of that,2
It's a little annoying that I'm paying $10 a month but there are still songs that are blocked,4
"Completely broken for me, can listen to anything",1
Absolutely love my Spotify premium ❤️,5
"It is absolutely perfect for music, when it works. Lately I have been encountering a lot of glitches like the play bar at the bottom disappearing and the playback slider not working. It forces me to close and restart the app every time. The queue will also occasionally rearrange itself and sometimes makes copies of songs in queue. Once these get fixed, I will change my review.",2
It plays a song for ten seconds then stops,3
"Used to be really good. Lots of issues and glitches now, it constantly disconnects between my phone and other devices. Wondering if other apps are better for the price 🤔",2
Used to be the best music streaming service now it shoves podcasts down my throat 24/7 just pay for yt premium or apple music,1
"I really like the app. However, the fact that you have to pay to listen to specific songs just bugs me. My parents won't pay for it, but some of the songs I like, such as Savage and Heart Attack, I have to go through playlists or find the song, put it into one of my playlists, and even then, I might not get to listen to it! So if you could change that, it would absolutely get you a 5 star rating, but until you change that, no way. Edit: Also, I agree with Gryffin Gurl",5
Nice audio quality ❤❤❤,5
I tried looking up artists that I listen to but it said there were no matches. So I uninstall it then re-install it and now it says that my username is incorrect? I can't log in and spotify is saying I had an issue logging in when I have the smart lock on so it has the correct password.,1
"This app haves good quality music but the problem is when I try to press on a specific playlist it doesn't load, I restalled the app and now it won't search a song I wanna listen to please fix this.",2
Where did the lyrics go? Newest UPDATE thru playstore removed them. WHY???,1
I'm on my last nerve with Spotify I hope Spotify goes to hell 😍,1
The search bar keeps telling me it can't find songs - it doesn't matter what I type into it.,3
"I liked it, it work with payment and without payment, well obviously is better with paying, butsize is amazing, I recommended",5
I've been experiencing a few issues for a few months now which is annoying. Search not working entirely until app cache is cleared and restarted. Also music playing but the player not showing up.,3
"Long things like podcasts literally don't play anymore, no it is not my internet. Fix this now Spotify.",1
"Great app, great music but for the last month or so I haven't been able to listen without it not working when on other apps or having my phone closed and Ive never had this problem before. The reason I originally chose Spotify was bc it works in the background but now it doesnt",3
"Yeah man, it's Spotify",5
Feel great to use an app to help my favorite artist.,5
Stop asking me to connect to Alexa devices. I don't own any,1
if i hear one more suggested song in a playlist i made i swear i will lose my mind. Please stop i just want to listen to my favourite songs but all i hear is songs I don't know and don't like. I'm tired of using all of my skips just to skip the suggested songs,1
"Low res covers with average sound quality... Like what are y'all storing that's so taxing on storage, y'all don't even offer lossless. why?",3
Why did you feel the need to limit skipping songs and not allow to go back without premium,1
It used to be an amazing app with a few adds here and there but now there is more adds than music.,2
"Great app all around until recently... Bugs need to be fixed, if people are paying for premium",3
This is so good to download it cause you can play whatever you want a song and you can post it i love it,5
I just wanna listen to 1 song. It keeps taking me to Playlist of song that isn't what I search,1
"Even with paying for premium and highest speed internet on EVERY device there's always buffering, pausing, freezing..... Disappointing",3
4 minutes of ads back to back after I paid for the premium. What's up with that?,3
It's a really good app to use while sleeping or when ur doing work but there are just UNLIMITED amount of ads. Like 1 song plays then there will be like 3 ads and that's just ruins the fun. Overall it's the best app to listen music!,3
This app sucks. I have no control on stopping or starting. Doesn't work with headphones,2
"No ads, just my type of play. The thing I don't like is the shuffle, meaning it play a different music or song you picked. I don't like that.",4
Good app with poor music recommendations,3
This app is great and all but sometimes when I click on a song I want to listen to it gives me a whole other song,4
"Refuses to work behind a proxy. The Windows version has settings for proxies, why not the app? Spotify is the buggiest app I've ever seen. It lags on any device to load. It freezes when you change sources. It messes up Windows. 50% of the time, on a dozen new Android devices, it will grey out all downloaded songs when you have no internet. All my cars, all my running watches have no internet and I have music half the time because Spotify's bs programming. Contacted for years, no fix. Worst ever",1
Love listening to all new and old tunes.,5
"I listen for free and the advertising compared to other apps is far too frequent and so annoying. I feel like it is a bully tactic to get people to subscribe, which just turns me off.",2
The app is great but for the past few days I haven't been able to listen to my music and I would like to know why,4
The ads suck and don't even get me started You get 6 ads for an hour you At least a 100 so it's really hard To use the app I enjoyed it the 1st couple days but then ads started rolling going in and then it it sucked so yeah Just take this advice,3
Gave Adele a touch too much exposure. Nothing technically wrong with that. Julian Alvarez understands. Almost as good as Beppe Grillo basically.,4
It wont let me even log in I have to change my country and whenever I click on log in with google it always says theres a problem have another go please fix it let me use the app it never works i wanna make a new account using the same email!!!,1
I don't like how if you want to listen to a sertain song that you can't cuz it is all on shuffle.,1
"Videos in car should be a toggle , if people feel like they can't handle video when connected to car Bluetooth let people chose. So annoying this comes and goes every other update",1
this has to give you more freedom in phones you cant play a specific song and you cant go to the previous song instead on pc you can do all the above also i cant see why would i prefer that from a music app the only difference is that you can play songs instantly instead of having to download them also for this positive thing you there are 2 negatives ads and you have to be connected internet or just pay to have this things,1
"Been waiting for the update with lyrics on phone for quite a while but I still don't see them even though I have Premium. I have clean uninstalled and reinstalled the newest version multiple times, logged out back in twice as suggested in forums but no luck. It works on all my friends Android devices. Desktop version shows them for me. Unfinished/broken features on paid subscriptions is a big red flag for me. Gonna drop the rating to 1 star till fixed.",5
"Long time user and moving to another service. Playlists have become so repetitive they're useless. Like 80% of my Spotify-created playlists starts with the exact same song, every single day. And they're made up of about 80% the same songs. Offline downloads don't work half the time, so when I'm on a hike and want to listen to music I have to have a backup app with songs downloaded.",1
Im really happy you can preview songs before you add them to a playlist again!!! like it was 3 stars without but like ahhhhhh yes. makes making playlists and discovering new music a million times easier! (i have premium btw),5
I love Spotify! Especially for my get togethers. I make a Playlist and just let it run! I also use it for my podcast Lifeofy. My mother uses it as well and my kids for workouts and parties!!! Love how you can que songs so everyone can hear something they want!,5
The app continues to freeze and then stop working even after an update. Please limit the amount of ads they get annoying and time consuming.,1
Quite buggy and loads of ads,3
Love Spotify on every platform.,5
"Hi, I love this app. I have it on my phone and tablet, but there's differences between them. Firstly, on my tablet, I can chose any song I want to play. On the other hand, my phone doesn't let me play a specific song, and when I'm playing my playlist, some random songs just play. Please fix this stuff that happens for free version. Not everyone wants to pay for the subscription, like me. Just make it equal because I just want to play music I like and don't get the chance because of this.",4
"Only reason to download this app is the Joe Rogan Experience. Every time I use the app on my phone it crashes at least once. I have a brand new phone and this is the second phone it crashes on. It crashes so often my new phone even tells me the app ""frequently crashes should be put into deep sleep"". The app for TV does not play video........ why?",1
Awesome flawless collection of music genres,5
My Constant Music App I use this every day for my Taxi job all the time.,5
"Awesome, Easy to use, just takes awhile to build your playlist again. Wish it had a shuffle feature(or I just haven't found it yet)",4
Expensive! Not even competitive £10 / month,3
Good app easy to use 1 issue recently music streaming was stopping after 30 seconds and not starting again for at least a minute. Seems to be working fine again now.,4
Great service! And a pretty crisp design,5
"It's super reliable and many choices for listening throughout. Although, the have taken down many epic and amazing JRE podcasts and for that alone, they suck. Otherwise pretty great.",5
Favorite music at ur fingertips...instantly. I love it!!!,5
What's up with all the bugs? Music stops because of in app notifications. Most of the time the lock screen controls don't appear. Frustrating,4
It's very easy to listen to music 🎶,5
Thank you for bringing back the song previews. I can efficiently make my playlists again 🤗,5
can't preview songs while adding to playlists anymore.,3
"It's pretty good , but to get a 5 star a lot of work needs to be done.",3
"Too many ads , and what's with the lyrics . It's all messed up . You watch an Ad for 30 secs and you get free 30 mins except ads goes for 1 min and after 3 songs another ad pops up. Y'all be drivin it too much for the money .",1
Enjoyable and professional,4
"The amount of advertising has exploded. This is a great app if you want to listen to two songs, followed by three ads. I am looking for another option, because Spotify has definitely declined recently.",1
Playing random songs that arent in my playlist even though i have 23 songs in it-,3
"Awsome app,great sound quality,huge catalogue",5
Plays ads after app is closed and you need to force stop it. So many ads.,2
"For my liked songs, it doesn't let me scroll through the different categories/genres.",1
Spotify the best in music and where you recover your soul,5
"Best app for song,music and podcast I",5
just because of the ads,3
Excellent experience but the ads are a lot if not considering premium.,4
only problem is using phone as a remote is insanely laggy I DONT TO LISTEN YEAT BUT I CANT SKIP,2
With this app am a very happy person because am learning through song messages,5
I tried listening to one specific song but instead get random stuff it was so annoying and this happens for a lot of stuff,1
Spotify - outstanding app for simplicity and non-stop Gospel Song or Music.,5
Not good app can't skip songs,1
I would like to have the option to repeat a song as many times I want.,4
"I love it beos there are international songs koren,English 5 ⭐",5
Great content terrible app. Gets stuck playing but says it's not playing so you cannot pause or play. Only way is to completely reset the app by closing it out. This happens nearly every time. Samsung S20.,2
Sometimes the system can't handle me playing to much music and if I swipe app and come back on to try play the same song it just simply won't play! Else I do prefer it over apple music !,4
Such a great music app and preferably my favorite!,5
app is good but I agree with the reviews 😵‍💫 but cmon let us chose whatever song we want but with ads I prefer to listen to my music in order but atleast with ads instead of paying to chose what song I want to listen to ad free😭😭😭,5
"Been a premium user for years and have spent thousands of hours listening to music. It's one of my favorite apps and ways to listen to music after being spammed by ads from Pandora a few year years ago. Plus, I really enjoy the fact they now include lyrics.",5
"Spotify is great but it just deleted all my downloaded tracks for no reason I can see, so it's three stars only today.",3
"This App is good, It has some glitches sometimes that needs to be fixed. Pretty handy overall.",3
The best music app.,5
Awesome very user friendly 😁,5
I think it comes down to preference but I enjoy using Spotify more than other music platforms and do recommend at least trying spotify.,5
Honestly great app but I hate it just adds songs by itself,1
Best app in the market. Literally everyone uses it. Very user friendly interface. Even the premium version is worth it.,5
So good app nice sound quality💜,5
"Broken app now. Don't know what happened but I no matter what I do, I can't play music, nothing loads or is even clickable anymore. Uninstall, update, nothing. Windows still still fine but the app is useless.. So I'm basically paying to look at names of albums I've heard recently and that's about it. I can't even search for music. Also disabling account is pretty confusing so I'm gonna get charged for something I can't use now.",1
"It's a 100% perfect music app , but fix the bugs in searching for songs.",4
"4* due to ads, otherwise it is 5*",4
Best music experience.,5
"This app is honestly super dope but after every second y'all juss be wanting us to pay premiums and shii whilst fuel cost R25 a litre...like seriously tho!(. Y'all gotta understand WE ARE BROKE GUYS...so please nehh, please!!",3
Overall performance is really bad! On every update app getting slower.,2
i love it i listin to music everywhere even ask you what type of songs you want,5
Too much advertisements.,2
"Actually this app was really great but it's new update disappoints me, I can't play my favorite songs and it's too restricting. This app makes me infuriated! 😤 And I'm gonna uninstall this right now!",1
This app sucks big time. I got the premium and it was still loaded with ads and commercials. Its not user friendly. Honestly spotify should take their lessons from youtube,1
The songs on playlist dont bring a list of songs,1
"Welcome to the new era of music listening experience. The premium membership is totally worth it. I have my family included in the membership because you are able to send up to five invitations for any of your fams that want to listen to music. You are able to share each other's listening history and share each other's perspective for the Love of music. As an eclectic human being, I desire many different options, and the daily mixes that are automated for me absolutely perfectly mixed. Thank you",5
"The app itself is great, works fine, but I don't appreciate if the premium charge bounces, when you reprocess the payment and it automatically upgrades you from premium to the next more expensive plan (like single person to two) and you cannot access billing through the app. You have to access billing through the website only.",3
Too much ads,2
Fed with adds they come like 3 or 4 times in a row,4
Best app execpt the advertisements.. Everything is good,4
It's not a bad app although the fact that you can not choose the song you wish to listen to kinda sucks. I don't really skip nor mind the ads but I want to be able to choose what I listen to not the have it on shuffle.,4
I pay 11.99 a month and still can't play my downloaded music offline. I can't get ahold of anyone from Spotify to help me with this problem and can't seem to find where to take my credit card off my account. This has been happening since I transfer my stuff over from my last phone. Very unsatisfied with this service!!!,1
itd be perfect if i didnt have to pay for premium to have my music downloaded.,5
Love this app but too much ads,5
"your app just scammed me of R60, please see to the issue like i subscribed, i have the bank notification the app worked for a day i could download music but now why do I have to update my payment for a third time i was supposed to get a free month but y'all still took money now y'all want a third subscription in the space of one week? nah g, fix my issue or gimme a refund",1
This good but never dawnload song 🤦,3
"I only use this app for podcasts. Otherwise, it's useless. It never sticks to the albums I select and often plays songs that aren't my playlists. And I hate that the desktop version only plays two songs between ads. I'm better off listening to music on YouTube. At least those ad breaks are short and skippable.",2
It's annoying how I have to be online to be able to select my downloaded music from the latest update.,4
"This is quite a nice music app, well developed and well thought, but I hate it that when I navigate the app offline, even if I downloaded like 800 songs, I can't play none of them. Like, that should be the perfect ideal situation the download option was created for. Even after closing and reopening the app several times, my downloaded songs won't play. So the thing is, I'm wasting around 4 gb of space for nothing. At this point it's better to get Spotify Free and not the Premium version.",3
"So um idk why but my phone doesn't have the play pause button at the bottom anymore and I really don't like it. Also I Can't open the song I am listening to or see it's lyrics. It also is slow when it's loading the song I searched. I really would appreciate it if you fix all these issues I have stated and also everyone else's issue please . ( try to go threw comments ) Other than that, the app is extremely cool.",3
Hifi Lossless quality audio streaming has to come,1
Great! I love seeing the lyrics and the recommend selections are SPOT on 😉,5
"*an alright app, especially when not using premium but some issues I just don't dig;; 1. unavailability to save queue as a playlist 2. shuffle doesn't work unless you skip the song,, is when it finally shuffles 3. search should have a filter when it comes to searching for playlists (I'm new to using this app, bare with me) to have an ascending-descending option n vice versa, when it comes to likes and playtime",3
"The free version is not ad free, but the ads are not annoyingly frequent. Also, I know everyone worries about ""big brother,"" but I like that the ads are relevant to me. Also, there is no real competition for what they provide...",5
This is the only app I use for music & podcasts!!!,5
"App is Good, i just didn't liked it's widget. I would love if developers improve its widget's interface/layout, bcoz it looks so simple",4
App won't work for me at all. I can't play any music and I have premium! It also says all playlists are empty. The app used to work perfectly for me now I can't get it to work on this device at all.,1
I dont have a radio in my truck so I use this on my phone.,4
Best musice platform on the planet 🌏 ✌️,5
Horrible app performance after latest update,2
Nice app but please remove the ads without premium,5
"I'm having some slight glitches with the album covers showing. I have excellent reception, so that's not the problem.",1
This is very useful very simple app and good,5
Please add option for list of songs singer wise. Its very difficult to browse songs of our favorite singer's or artists,4
Why I have a s22 ultra latest update why does 💩 not work right this is going on like 6 months,1
"I like the app but its frustrating sometimes, for example: I can't play just one song, it always shuffles to a different song even though I went to play a single, I can't seem to find my account details which restricts me from seeing what email I'm using, and lastly, it always on shuffle even though I didn't put it on shuffle.",2
"I listen music while gaming too,it's fun listening music in Spotify",5
This music and selection is totally awesome!!,5
The best ever streaming platform,5
App that I use every single day. Great way to explore and enjoy the music.,5
"I'm still fine with the app for the most parts, I especially love the large selection of podcasts! HOWEVER why on earth does it stop playing whenever I open Instagram and there is a MUTED video on my timline!! watching muted reels and stories is fine, but beware if there's some random video in your feed lol",3
Premium Member for 6 years now; before and I've haven't had to buy an album again. Everything is fresh and theres always something new.,5
"Tis good, I prefer some older features for the desktop version tho",4
Very nice app. I just listen to my choice of music and i 😉,4
"Good selection but has playback issues, regularly cuts out for a few seconds for no reason at all",2
Car mode is annoying!! Im sick of having to choose. Stop car mode please.,3
A very good app but there are some songs missing and so many ads we used to face while listening to the music I know ads are important for your business but too many ads are not good show people limited ads after 15 or 20 mins u can run ads but not after every song change,3
Occasional bugs. I have been a prime music user and now I really feel like I have upgraded even though I have just switched to a free service from a paid service.,5
Used to be five stars. That was before the music that I'm listening to would skip or pause completely. After the recent update the music have been playing weirdly. Hopefully spotify sees this and corrects the app so the music will stop skipping/pausing while playing. Spotify needs to hurry up and fix this song skipping issue,5
Awful i hear more ads and less songs,1
"Turn it on and let it go, no talk, no ads!",5
"I would give no stars but I need to review Do not get the premium it's awesome that you get better sound quality and unlimited skips but if you want to cancel keep doing it because they will continue to charge you ""because that's how the system works"" is what I was told by customer support I urge you not to use this service",1
This best music player i never used before. Thank you so much created this player. I listen to music in this player.,5
It's a wonderful app but they need data to save your music playlist,4
"Eyerthing is fine about this app except add timings,after 5 min interval add starts to play more than I used to hear songs",3
Full of ads,1
"Its an amazing app, the only thing I would change is the fact that you only have 6 skips, i get that its a premium feacher but it gets anoying, besides that I love this app!!!",5
It used to be a five star but they made it so that on spotify free you can't listen to a playlist with shuffle off it's crazy .,1
I don't like ads in between music,1
Best application for Anime songs!,5
Too many adds,1
Worth the price to go Premium!,5
Best app for music!Umm if childrens are reading this post pls don't do this. Means I realy like this app so listen songs in toution like realy and school uuuuu 😅😅 pls students/childrens don't do this. Ummm but this app is good I love it and for high quality music so I listen songs during tuotion ummmmmm during school also!,5
My experience Spotify is most amezing app for the music 🎵,5
All my downloaded songs are gone somehow. Now Im unable to play offline. Worst experience ever.,1
"Bring back the feature where, when I select podcasts in my library, each show is listed in order of most recently updated and has a subtitle saying when it was updated. Knowing if an episode came out today or yesterday is useful information, most podcasts drop different types of episodes on different days. Please stop removing useful features for no apparent reason. Still buggy, every time they patch something, something else starts acting weird. Again having premium makes no difference.",2
"Awesome, THE BEST Music App of this generation!!!",5
I wish I could somehow see what songs I've heard before. I'm going through a 69 hour playlist and it's hard to keep track of my place in the playlist and on random setting I'll never know if I heard all the songs. Or sometimes I don't remember if I've heard a playlist or album before or just parts of it.,5
I like the way I can find songs easily and tons of songs to chose from,5
Still a very good app. The earliest versions of the app were superior (0.7) but I find I can do everything I want with this app. Great compatibility with corresponding apps for Spotify connect on a number of platforms.,4
Toatlly full of ads Irritated,1
The app works great I was using iHeartRadio iHeartRadio and in front of my introduced me to spotify I use spotify now when I don't use iHeartRadio.,4
"I have Spotify premium and it has been a great experience until now. The app has begun to switch to the next song when Im only half through with the first one, skipping it on its own. It also will pause on its own and not play the next song. I thought it was a wifi problem, but these are downloaded songs. It used to let me play downloaded songs when out pf wifi range but it will no longer play them, making the download feature pointless",1
Control player disappears. Please allow for multiple selections of titles. Samsung Fold 3,3
"The coustmer service is the best...they reply the mails quickly and it takes maximum 2 days for them to fix any problem within the app ....well it was 2 days for me. I enjoy the premium, and to be true i loved that they have premium for University students, and it's very cheap.",5
I loved this app I can listen to every song I want to listen and they even have very nice playlist 😄😄,5
"No words for this app use and rate it I am future teller so you will not left this app . So welcome to your permanent addective and super easy to use , app. We all are Spotify family.",5
I love Spotify I can select what music I want when I want!!,5
The only problem about this app is the add but still it is a very great app to listen to music,4
There are lots of pirated songs on this app .,3
"4 star. I love spotify and I wouldnt trade it for any other app. Things that need attention: I found that if I have a playlist or something on shuffle, not all of the songs play before repeating songs I have already heard.",4
"ads, Ads,ADs,ADS,AND MORE ADS then when you think they stopped AD RIGHT THERE",1
The app really good I can hear all of my favourite songs,5
Best music app ever also highly recommend premium if you can't afford it get duos and spit it with a friend,5
Useless app literally. I tried playing the song I want but it only plays the suggested song. I don't recommend this app😑,1
"It's pretty good, although it does change music on you sometimes. For example, I'd be listening to a playlist of 8 Graves, and then it'd play TeZatalks out of nowhere. Other than that, it's fine.",4
Excellent this app was really good specially i also really like kpp sonfs so it is best for me saranghe spotify(love spotify),5
Love this app I can listen to all the music,5
the best! they have a lot of songs!,5
I find the music I like and it's so easy .,5
It seems like is bug free now.,5
Super app but reduce ads,4
I really love this music app...alot,2
I did 3 stars because not everyone can't use premium because it costs money and the ads are ridiculous I'm sick of hearing the same ad every day.,3
Can use it in background and easy to use,5
I use it 6 days as week 14 hours a day this is the absolute best app hands down,5
"Pays poorly compared to other services. Also decides to mess up when there's no internet connection, so that's fun. After all this, they increased prices in a sly way by only warning of your current subscription going up, not others. And now the app is going all wonky. If you're increasing prices, increase the quality, not lower it. Tried moving songs to SD card, had to force shut app then reinstall it.",1
Love the app so far. Very good selections of music for all taste.,4
"If you're always making changes, and improving, then tell us what you changed and improved. The 10,000 song limit is stupid ridiculous. Also, minus 1 more star for never telling us specifically what changes and improvements have been made. Can you at least link to a blog or something?",3
Having an awesome time using Spotify,5
Not able to Login my Account On Spotify App . 🥲 Please help,1
"Every time i open a new instance of the app to listen to a podcast i previously started, spotify junps to the next commercial spot, ussually at the end of the episode, and i lose my spot in the playback. Been happening for months.",2
Great!! Offline option is awesome,5
Should be able to listen to the song you want with out going through so much trouble,2
Best app for music frrr,5
"App will not connect to internet. Can access the app and log in, but can not play music. ""Something went wrong"" cleared cache, cleared data, uninstalled, reinstalled. Nothing.",1
"I've been using Spotify for over 4 years. Premium is great, for the most part. I'm annoyed that it randomly erases my queue or, most recently, isn't even allowing me to view my queue (rebooted the app, then the phone, then uninstalled/reinstalled to see if that fixed it). Other than those annoying gaffes, I enjoy the plethora of music and podcasts available. The ability to change playback speed is phenomenal, though it would be even more awesome if that option was available for music.",4
Opened this all first time in 3 years 5 ads back to back. I suggest another app,1
Best music app ever !,5
"Premium feature So I've been a Spotify user for a while now, maybe 2 or 3 years now, and decided to use premium. Highlighting the pros and cons I've come across using Spotify Premium. Pros: unlimited skips, ad free, and shuffle feature. Cons: Spotify will shuffle the music order instead in the order you choose (not sure if that's a bug), songs will randomly start playing from other playlists and the music will suddenly stop playing for no reason. So hopefully these cons get fixed.",3
"Too much ads , its ok to show ads but it's too much.",1
I love this app i can easyly find any song even if i am on other acc by serching ur user you can play ur playlist,4
"Rating it as one, because I don't think they want any user experience here. I mean I understand one ad is okay, but back to back 3 ads in one go. Pathetic.",1
Great sound. Easy to use.,4
Great choice and variety,5
a great app for music and podcasts,5
Variety of playlist available based on your mood & fav artist. Reasonable price for student subscriptions.,5
was great till all my playlists decided to just be available to preview only.,3
Spotify plays all of my favorite songs and let's me make my own playlist.,5
"Everytime i enter my email it becomes red and doesn't allow me to continue. Please fix it, Spotify...",2
Not working properly on samsung watch 4 lte,4
I have been using this app since last 2 years. This is a great app for listening online and offline music. Also the charge for subscription is low. Totally my experience was good with this one song app..thanks team Spotify..,5
Please fix the mobile network download bug... Data ain't cheap. Still 5 Star though,5
Absolutely worst app ever. If you don't have premium like this time around i couldn't take the premium. This app will show ads right after one song or sometimes in the middle that too 2 ads 30secs each continuously. This is too much now. Can't tolerate this nonsense anymore. Better to switch to some other music app.,1
I am enjoying listening to music which I have chosen,5
The audio and lyrics are amazing but I just don't understand why I can't listen to a specific song and when I make a Playlist with less than 15 songs it's automatically adds songs by itself and I can't even skip properly Also my ad experience is below zero,2
I used to love Spotify but the aggressive way it's trying to force podcasts on me and the horrendous way it makes other other artists pretend to be more well known names is bloody frustrating.,2
"Now I've never heard music before and then someone told me to get this. I was like ""yeah right!"" First off, ""music"" can't be all that great, otherwise I would have heard it already. Second of all, how can an app have what it claims, which is music to listen to?? Well let me tell you folks! I was wrong!! Not only is music very very good and interesting, but this app has it! You can listen to it on headphone, or the phone or the computer and other ways! You gotta try this!",5
"Long time premium member. Spotify is part of my daily to and from work. There was a problem before with it shutting down when I was using my phone on other apps, the web etc. It seemed it was fixed and as of this morning seems it's back again. As a premium member I would hope this is addressed quickly so I can give it a better rating.",3
Loding and ads issues always,4
"The only preferred app for high quality music , the best genres , the best music combos and many more!",5
Nice music updates but only if you put the option for downloading mp3,4
Nice app to listen a music,5
best streaming music app,5
"It keeps giving me suggested songs when I turned the option off, can't listen to a certain song it gives you a random song by them or similar if you have a pc get the pc version please.",2
My go-to music no matter the mood I'm in. I can always find a good variety of songs from all genres!!!,5
pretty good. I just would like if you stop the ads.,4
Its too much good for audio,5
Spotify is good for tablet and laptop but it sucks on mobile. You cant select a single song but you have to play the entire playlist to get to your one song. Making it annoying when you just want to hear one song. Id rather use Youtube for music on my phone than spotify. They have to do something about because it really sucks a ton. I dont recommend it on the phone at all but on tablet and laptop/computer then sure.,2
Great way to listen to all your favourite music. Whenever I drive I listen via Android Auto.,5
"it's a good app runs smooth simple ui and I've always used the solo premium plan but recently I did the family plan with 6 profiles and it was fine for a month or so but after that it changed my plan to the solo premium again, charged me 10 instead of 16 and canceled premium on my family's devices when I didn't change anything so that was my 1st bad experience with spotify",3
Dabba app more adds will come don't install this app friends,1
I like Spotify Ive used it for 5 years and not once has it let me down,4
Great music selection,5
"So basically everything is ok? But umm I really have to say that whenever I just want to play a song even I click the name but the other song pop out uhhh I'm hoping they can fix this. Because it's really to listen to a song sometimes. And even u got playlist u can't play that song it have to be followed by number. The system it self keep adding other song that I definitely didn't add, that's really disturbing",1
Thanks for reverting the playback control buttons to their initial places.,5
Only give 3 stars caz. of adds caz they says 30 min of uninterrupted music and adds comes after every music,3
"Still the best one so far. The bad thing is that when you install, could suggest better music from Brazil, like classic MPB (Vinicius, Tom, Toqunho, Miucha, Chico, etc).",5
I want to block all podcasts from my Spotify home for good. Please give us a new subscription tier that will automatically block all podcasts. Thank you.,1
Spotify Is Good But Please Just Give Free Spotify Users An Advantage,5
This app is good💜ther are all song thare bts blackpink song too🦋💜love is app 💜 💜 💜 💜 💜 💜,3
Nice app. But would like the dislike functionality on all rather then just the weekly suggestions,5
just plays music and podcasts it good can connect to crome casts laptops and playstation don't know about Xbox I don't have one I was playing music and got 6 ads with out 30 minuets of ads a disgrace,4
Let me tell you people I know the ads suck but if it shows you a ad just take off the app and boom no ads,5
"Only the Ads is the only thing which is really really terrible, horrible whatever the word ypu use here, but it's true. The Premium subscription for this also seems bit expensive for an Individual.... Should have been little less expensive and much more affordable in price, So that those who loves to listen music from Spotify, don't have to find an alternative for this one. I hope they note the point, once again!! 😌🙏🏻",4
Can't play songs before adding them to my playlist.,2
The app has been quite easy to use. So far I have had no issues with it.,5
"Cool I love listening to music 🎵🎶 it's a cool app I don't have that much problems so it's a great app👍😁 the problem is that it needs internet so yeah,it needs internet to work but that doesn't bother me that much so it's a great app👍😁❤️",5
This app makes finding the music that suits you easy. It can also pair with several devices enabling you access to the convenience that it provides. This app truly is a masterpiece and I encourage the developer's to keep adding more cutting edge software into the interfaces and security aspects.,5
This app is so amazing you can choose Song Download now,5
Super Duper....sucks a little in the free option.,5
"Enjoy the next 30 minutes free from advertising.. song..ad.ad.ad.ad.song.ad.ad.song.song.ad..... I was a pior premium user, but due to excessive bugs and podcast issues have chosen to discontinue paying for a premium account and will probably find a alternative service.",1
Its a good music app.,4
Great selections of music,4
When you using Google Chrome on your phone Spotify will sometimes just cut off completely then restart the song your listening to and will happen multiple times in a row please fix,5
Excellent love Spotify,5
"Very nice music app with almost all music I know on it. Easy to make playlists and share music. Only too bad you cannot orden your playlists very efficiently. I listen to a lot of different genres and I have about 30+ playlists, which I cannot arrange top to bottom. Also showing your account to other spotify users, or accessing others accounts is a bit confusing but not entirely impossible, however, anyone who visits your account will initially only see your last 3 playlists. no clue why........",4
Great. I found all my favorites from when I was growing up.,5
Struggle to connect with amazon echo auto,3
Nice app! But many songs are not present here!,4
"Question: I got a free version with ads. The ad will play for 30 seconds and Spotify will announce that next 30 mins are ad free. So my question is what does ad free and 30.mins means? Because the ads will continue after the announcement and once that's over, more ads will start after around 15 mins. Don't know if to trust the paid version. The music is very limited. 6 months and you are done with Hindi music",2
4/23/22 Will change rating when the song preview feature when adding songs to a playlist has been returned,5
"These updates have screwed with my experience.....offline mode is no longer available the moment you put it on and stays that way until you reset and I have to redownload everything again. This becomes annoying(an under statement) but seriously do something about this, and yes I have premium(Samsung A70)",5
"I think Spotify is one of the best music services in the world. The song collection is incredible. But other music services have better audio quality than Spotify. So Spotify should add next-gen audio technologies like spatial audio. But overall, it's a great app for music .",3
"This is my best music app i use everyday, but the ad is so f**kin anoying.",5
It's all good now 😇 .lyrics are there 😇 .thanks for always improving the app 😇,4
"Sometimes it makes me think this is the worst UI with buggy music app, I've been a premium member for almost an year still this thing won't load interface or songs properly most of the times",2
Very nice music app 👍 👍,5
Its a headache There are too many ads and it will make you uncomfortable when you in a way of your own life of music 🤬,2
"I am very sorry but the new update is trash i cant even click on my playlist normaly, i cant choose what song and its just annoying if you could update it to the older version again i would be very happy so pls do it,maaaannnyyy people dont like the new update",1
"Lower your ad volume, it's louder than the music... almost destroyed my 460$ headphones",3
Currently using Spotify on Redmi Note 8 without any problems. Please make Share Lyrics to Instagram available as soon as possible. Thanks,5
Please improve audio quality of songs,2
Thpe most perfect Music platform i have seen soo far. Just perfect,5
"Just love music, music is my life and Spotify helps me listen to it",5
"Good app, wish it had an EQ. Only had to reinstall twice to fix an issue in the 5 years or so I've been using it",4
In some songs there are lyrics in Punjabi or in other regional languages so pls fix it try to change them in Hindi or English,4
Great. Im using this app for five years and always great,5
this app is good but they're too many ad:-\,2
"No matter what mood your in, you can find the perfect song on Spotify.",5
"Recommend new and old songs daily so that people can vibe. Your company is only running because of the API and podcasts. But Spotify as a music app still needs a push ... Speaking facts ""Resso"" Is better as Music app",3
Just want to say thank you to the Spotify team for assisting me . I had my account hacked and found out I had 6 users subscribed to my account details . After contacting them they assisted me with the process and I have received my refunds and those accounts have been blocked . Very impressed with there service ! Well done team !,5
"I was amazing with this app. It provides everything song, podcasts and much more that I wanted",5
Best quality of music compared to any other music apps plus the clutstering technique of the fav playlists is top notch,5
Music Streaming just got better.,4
Enjoying everything most especially OLDTIME FAVORITES !,5
They disallow local (offline) storage if you not a paid user BUT they still use your phone to store ALL the songs in order to save their server data use. They WILL try to funnel you into music you don't want. If you good at structuring your music selection so to not even need skipping songs they will FORCE you out of it by LITERALLY refusing to play it after a while and instead pay random songs not in your list EVEN TOUGHT you disable the related future. The app is NOT being improved either,1
So much ti choose from with podcasts abd music. Love it!,5
Playing any other song but app play other song 😈,1
Love it 😀 wayyyy better than pandora or any other music streaming services by a long shot. I haven't had any negative experiences other than when I started my spotifiy premium trial and it didn't let me listen without internet :/ overall the best streaming service on the app store. I 100% would recommend and would even argue in favor to this application.,5
"Can't even play my song, desktop version is 999999x better",1
Whenever too my mind to listened so I'm listening my favourite song in Spotify that is too awesome app for songs like hindi Korean Chinese so i like it Spotify,5
THIS IS A MUST HAPP ON YOUR PHONE OR COMPUTER OR ANY DEVISE YOU HAVE WHERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD SPOTIFY. Althoughit would be a ten star if it would stop playing other random songs that you didn't put up on a playlist,5
"I've had issues with it in the past but recently it started playing three commercials for every one song. I contacted customer support to see if it was some sort of error and no one even looked into it, the just suggested I try a free month of Spotify Premium to see if I'd prefer it with no commercials. I'd prefer an app that wasn't 3/1 commercials over content.",1
"App keeps crashing on my S20FE, please fix it",1
Always great to listen to when you have excellent signal,5
Functional and easy to use,5
All tym favorite 😍 music app just loved it....all kinds of collection is available...,4
Hi im dark and ive been using Spotify for many years now and it's the best thing that I've downloaded it give be a break from my life and every bad thing in it I love it. It's a must download,5
"The app was working fine in the past. But recently, whenever I search for a song it says ""no internet connection"" even though I have high speed connection and has no problem at all.",1
Tis app is good for the mental stress because every song has clear word which is cool for music lovers,5
I have turned of auto play multiple times yet it still plays music that it's adds it's self and alot of the music doesn't fit my playlist like I'm listening to sad music and it recommends me stuff like lemon demon touch touch telephone if I wanted to listen to that I would've selected it and when I try to skip it it says edit my play list and then doesn't let me skip anymore even though I still had 5 other skips pls fix this then I'll give it 5 stars,1
It's a good app but the prblm is there is too many advertisment,5
"Ot is amazing, and has every music I want, and if you buy premium this is the best music app ever",5
"I love this app!!! It's so nice being able to listen to all my favorite songs all day long ,uninterrupted and no ads.",5
"Worst music experience it only plays the suggested one and not what i searched, it has so many bugs and so many ads, i logged out and logged in again still it doesn't play my searched song its totally dictatorship",1
"I'm a premium user and would really like to rate it higher because it used to be really good, but recently I've been able to get onto my home screen but what I've donloaded doesn't play, I can't even get to the screen to see the songs in the playlist. Really upsetting when I've payed for a feature and I don't get it.",2
Whats wrong with this app? I have a good internet connection and yet the bloody apps could not load any list of songs,1
It of great pressure to keeps me fill safe and love every time I on it and brings back great icons .,5
"This whole app sucks on mobile, only mobile, when I try to listen to a song it will change the song. A different song will play instead of the one I want, not one I do not like.",1
"Good for listening to songs. The thing I like about Spotify is it's not like YouTube Music, because you don't have to keep the app open to listen to the songs.",5
Enjoy using this app to listen to pod casts and music.,5
I love Spotify... The music is endless! The playlists they offer are excellent or make your own..... I have a library of both!!,5
Good but later when I used this I couldn't change songs pls revert back into last update because I can't change songs and I think everyone else can't too,3
"When playing with phone you can't play back, I like the lyrics",3
"I genuinely enjoy using Spotify since a lot of my favorite podcasts are on the platform but I haven't been able to use the app for long periods of time due to frequent crashes (it crashes on opening, on selecting albums/podcasts, on switching tabs, etc.)",3
"I've used Spotify for many years now, and I love it! I've had premium for a while, and I just went up to duo actually. It's going really well. There's only 1 suggestion I could make, and that's to please add in a feature that allows people to sort playlists into different groups that way I can see different groups of playlists and choose instead of all 36 of them at once. But it's a very good app!",5
"It's a great app and all, the music is good and you find what you want but the annoying thing is that when you search for a song you want to play and select it, it starts playing other songs that you did not even want to listen to and you have to wait for all thoooseeee songs to play, it's very annoying.... Please fix this, plus when you make a playlist it starts playing other songs that aren't in your playlist.... Please fix these issues, the are not making it user friendly enough",4
the best music platform,4
This app isn't bad at all its just when you want to play a song or something it shuffles it and you have to use all of your skips in order to play the specific song,3
Decent on terms of info about artist but why can't I have an option to view all of an artist's music in a list? Every other music streaming app I have allows this but for Spotify your choice is either viewing albums or a small list of top songs.,2
Last update mess up the play now control bar,5
"What's up with crashes when viewing video podcast? Other than that, audio features and plagbacks are top notch",2
"""no internet connection"" please fix this bloody issue. I'm so sick of it. Its been happening for months but everything else is working fine. For a multi million business this should not be a issue..spend some of that $$ on the bloody thing that made you rich. The thing I pay for!!!",1
It don't never put on the songs that I asked for to put on that's annoying,1
It won't let me listen to music I like I don't have to listen to trash music,1
My issue is how it's stops randomly and it will crash. I've been trying to fix the problem but it never seems to work and its getting annyoing,3
Login doesn't work...😡 Worst login criteria not able to login even after many attempts tried all ways now going to uninstall ....worst ....time waste....😡,1
The app was working fine until a couple of weeks ago. I can play any songs and it says I have no playlists. The app for my PC works fine and I downloaded it on my tablet and it works fine. It somehow just isn't cooperating with my phone.,2
Why do i have less songs then before and trying to recover them and they can't play wth is this,1
Don't like the interface when it connects to my Google maps I wish it wouldn't automatically connect,1
Very technical songs 👍,5
"This app was great at the start but sometimes its litterly pausing randomly and i cant play the song anymore and sometimes i cant open the app. Pls fix this, and its start playing as a mix and i cant choose a song on my playlist, pls fix this",4
Although the app is great I don't like it when it plays suggested freaking songs I don't want to listen to insted of my favorite song plus i can't loop no more because i did not want to the other songs that I did not want to listen to.,3
"If we are using for 30 mins , 10 mins only song will come... Remaining 20 mins Ads only will come... Contains more ad's... Very disappointed 👎",1
very greedy. can't we just skip ads? and why do we have to play a music in shuffle if you don't have premium,1
"Bugs for months! The app is close to unusable. Unacceptable, especially for Spotify premium A podcast started playing midway through a phone call. Controls for 'currently playing' not coming up in the app. Including no sign that Spotify is playing at all. Let alone outside of it on the screen or drop down menu. Randomly stops playing music. This is a previous bug that has also been occuring in recent updates.",1
"3 ads always, every 3 songs. this is too many ads and im not paying for Premium out of spite",3
"I paid and you switched my plan to individual and deleted my family's accounts. I can't even contact anyone to cancel this payment and fix it. We've had our family account for years. This is VERY unprofessional. I'm beyond livid. Update: I contacted support and there is nothing they can do. Years of our music is gone, they lied about what they were going to charge me, and changed it AFTER I hit submit, and they can't fix it. Be weary before you buy.",1
I get to listen to all my favorite songs there are songs for every mood even when I work out there are songs for it. And you can have your own playlist.Spotify is the best👍💯👍💯👍💯,5
The Playlist suggestions are always so on point I've discovered so many new artist I love.,5
Love but wish it was free for people have been there since the beginning or long time with them.,5
App is not launching after the update.,5
it's great but please return the preview of the songs,5
A great place to find and listen to your favorite hits,5
It's good but THE SHUFFLING NEEDS TO STOP I CANT PLAY ONE SINGLE SONG ALONE THIS IS WHY I UNINSTALLED IT EARLIER,2
"I found some of the songs that i couldnt find on other apps,",4
Spotify has all of my favorite music and new music that I have never heard,5
Simple and easy to use design. Grrat for looking up new songs. Especially for when i need that hype somg for new PR attempts inthe gym. Plus podcasts. Its good.,5
"This is a GREAT Music streaming service!! The annoying thing is that if you don't have an account, you have to have your music flow interrupted by ads!!! Yes, I know what y'all are saying; "" Well that's how we pay so you can listen for free""!!! I know, but it's Still annoying!!-lolol Otherwise this service Rocks!!",5
Spotify is the best musical app ever and I have no other comments. This is the best musical app.,5
"Spotify has the most amazing artist radios and so many different podcasts and every artist you've ever heard of. I am grateful for this service and all that they do. I hope they keep it up, they make listening to music a joy.",5
It's now my favorite app ....it's very informative and superb audio quality.....it's saves my so much time .....really helpful for students 👍 👌.......podcasts in hindi and English are superb 👌 👏 👍 😀,5
"Pretty great selection, very eclectic.",4
It's so amazing I use this app every single day!,5
A big tease. I don't recommend. Way too frustrating to listen to a specific song after 'liking' it.,1
I love Spotify because it helps with my stress and when am sad,5
"I wish there was a viable alternative for android. SO MANY BUGS THEY NEVER FIX. My friend sent a link to a song just now, took 12 tries of opening it to get spotify to actually go to the song.",1
This app just stops working suddenly even if you have updated and with a good internet connection.I would say even jungle has less bugs then their server....,1
Very cool app. It works very well for me with many genre of music from which to choose.,5
System keeps shutting down when trying to play a song..,5
I listen to a playlist There are 100+ songs in it but Nowadays only 7 songs repeat Everyday new 7 songs but no other song Why this is happening Why cant I listen all the songs I have the premium version of it then also ......,2
the songs playing always stopping on its own all the time it's annoying,1
Super good love it 110/12 play when u turn phone off had it since I was 5 good love it,5
"Not perfect, but does most everything I want. Easy to navigate and manage music and playlists.",4
"Great, easy to use music app with heaps of content. I use the free version and find the amount of ads reasonable",5
Super but some not have the lyrics,4
"I Can't see my downloaded audiobooks when I'm offline, I hate this new update😤",1
Finally I can enjoy Spotify in Botswana. I'm loving it so so much. The endless music and of course the podcasts. Never a dull moment with Spotify.,5
"Premium subscriber for many years, and I'm troubled by the increasing instability and new bugs. What worked perfectly for years now fails constantly even on completely different devices. For example, player control will disappear leaving you unable to control playback, then requiring you to force stop app, restart to restore control. And suggested music is far inferior to Pandora's genome. Seems that Spotify favors music that favors their own preferences than yours.",2
I am not good with words but I will say this is a great app. would recommend,4
Will stay the best music app forever!,5
It is super easy to use Spotify I love it!!,5
Learning so much and having fun in the process being inspired being in tune with so much art,5
Definitely the best music app I've used in my life,5
Was there an update that it now doesn't show what's currently playing? Not great.,1
Would be 5 star if my dang downloaded Playlists would stay downloaded. I pay for premium service for a reason. Tried a few things but nothing has worked yet.,3
Too many adds,1
"Still cannot run spotify in the background despite updating, despite having the option to play spotify in the background ON. There is definitely an issue here.",3
One of the best apps I've found for music. There's very little you can't find on Spotify. No annoying adds. Runs smoothly. Love it!,5
I like Spotify better than any of the others.,5
It literally shuffles songs when I don't want it to and I can't even listen to the songs I want anymore And you can't even skip the ads and when I tap on the song I want it just shows a preview instead,1
"GARBAGE! wouldn't play a single thing for longer than 2 seconds before the whole thing just went away. No ""stopped working"" notification or anything, just POOF. web player audio is all weird, gets loud for a second then quite. Whatta waste of time.",1
This is getting worse and worse. 6 ads before you play music is ridiculous.,1
I'm a dj and like the music updates and jamming to my Playlist in the car,5
It's almost perfect! I wish the play next button has crossfade mixing effect too. I'd love that feature.,5
Monthly update breaks the podcast player but doesn't allow you to to stop the podcast. The ie the dashboard for the podcast doesn't appear at the bottom. Happening again just a month later after another update. And again this app is getting worse for Samsung users.... Right on que one month later,1
0⭐ They say that we'll be able to enjoy thirty minutes of uninterrupted music after the ad. But instead they many a times play ads 4 times within thirty minutes.,1
Very good app nice music I like it too much nice,5
It's a really good app I found songs I forgot about,5
It was good first until YOU guys updated it. At first I was able to pick any song I wanted but NOW I have to use all my skips to get the song that I want (if the song is far then... You're not getting there) also there are too many ads I can't listen to a song/podcast without an ad popping up. I will be updating it back to 5 stars if you fix your stuff and make this app useful again.,1
"The music is good and reliable, I can at least rely on spotify. Thank you DJ Ken",5
Bestest music app to ever exist.,5
Reference of songs is not complete,4
Very user friendly and has all good collection of music.,5
Whats up with all the skipping songs? There's a lot of needing to close the app then reopen because its skipping too much,2
So good and enjoying to hear music,5
7 ads and 3 of them being 30 seconds....,1
Doesn't connect me to my account repeatedly asks me to make a new one terrible app,1
No way to clear the queue except when playing specific playlists; extremely annoying. Also can't clear queue/now playing if only one song is queued.,1
Annoying and inconsistent in its operation.,1
For kannada songs lyrics should be in kannada..it can be useful..add kannada lyrics for all kannada songs..so many mistakes are there in English lyrics for kannada songs,4
"Really good app, I love it!",5
I enjoy listening to my music on different devices..In the house and car..This app offers both,5
"Keeps crashing on Samsung S20+, and the PLAY BAR is just randomly missing...so no controlls to start or stop content! Fix it",2
"SPOTIFY is changing, and not for the better.... They have finally gone ""woke"" Bands complete discography is no longer on the site.... It's a bunch of live stuff and artist radio! I used to love Spotify! Since you canceled artists I may have to cancel you, for good.... What a shame!",1
"Great music, easy to navigate, daily picks are spot on.",5
I love Spotify and do t know what I'd do without it,5
It's not easy to navigate and it always autoplays even after coming out of the app.,2
Love the wide variety of music available and the ability to create my own Playlist.,5
"I've loved having Spotify premium for years now. I've got over hundreds of hours of content to listen to, multiple playlists and a myriad of podcasts I can listen to easily and seamlessly. Oh and they finally fixed the Android lock screen UI!",5
A lot of people on here complaining about the free version as if it's supposed to operate differently than Pandora. Honestly as a paid member I just want the app to function properly. Tired of the player not being displayed whenever I'm in or out of the app though.,3
Nice and easy to use,5
Love you guys.........I am a lover of music and I can get my filled with spotify......,5
Best music/podcast app I have experience. I have the duo from my stepbrother & myself for $12.99 & it's really great we both get premium & can duo mix out playlist together if we want.,5
"Amazing! Spotify is and always has been my favorite app for streaming and downloading music and podcasts. The only suggestion I would make is to get ahold of more b-sides, demos and rare cuts.",5
"I still love Spotify.. but what's up? The radio stations, my personal mixes.. they seem off. Sometimes it's just a playlist, not even radio, when I create a station?! It's just not the same. Bands that shouldn't be with the others, too much of the same band, repeating songs, different genres that don't mesh. I don't know what changed, but it makes me sad, I miss the old Spotify.",4
Given me the opportunity to explore music more thoroughly than local radio alone,5
Amazing but you should add some then features from Apple music,5
"Awesome will never go back to iHeartRadio or Pandora, Spotify is the way my brother lol...",5
Cannot stop the autoplay everytime I get in the car and my phone connects to the Bluetooth. I have to uninstall.,1
I can't log in. No internet connection prompt even though I'm connected.,5
Please fix. I have been fighting with this app for days. It keeps switching to shuffle mode even though I turn shuffle off. I am a paying member.,1
"Question? How come Spotify isn't paying me for teaching the younger generation about music? Makes sense to me, the less music gets forgotten the better.",3
"This app does 1 thing that no other app does. I can pause Spotify and not play anything for 3 hours, then when I disconnect my wireless buds it starts playing the previously paused music through my phone's speaker! FFS, just stay paused. Poor app, dodgy company, don't recommend anyone to pay for Spotify, it's a joke",1
It won't ever put the song I choose on and it puts random songs I don't like on and I have to use up my skips.,1
"I am having issues when I cast my phone to my TV or PS5, the screen freezes on the first song I play, it's froze on that screen whether I go back to the main page or not. Cancelled my sub after a year without resolution. P.S. pay musicians more $$$ for their exploited work.",3
"Pay for premium but still lots of ads, what am I paying for?",3
Love the app BUT the notifications update is less manageable and an eye sore. Less was more. One star until it gets fixed/changed back.,5
"It's a great app for listning music and my favorite show ""pertkotha""",5
"Theres some problem about the pc and android, for the pc you can like skipped the line but on android you cant",4
I always listen to my favorites on Spotify.,5
Premium is well worth it. I plan to use my premium account for my upcoming wedding reception and on the drive down to Florida for my honeymoon. Overall the app is pretty good. No crashing so far,5
Spotify has not been working for weeks. My while library is gone. Then when I click on a podcast it says no internet connection but I have internet. I have even Uninstalled the app and reinstalled it still did not fix it. I have been using this app for over 5 years and never had a issue like this. This is so frustrating!!! I have lost all my podcasts and music. Fix this!!!!,1
UNLIKE YOUTUBE I'M ABLE TO LISTEN AND DO OTHER THINGS ONLINE WITHOUT DISCONNECTING OR DROPPING A SONG.,5
"The best make your favorite radio station and just listen. It's the best . Thanks that review was from 2020. Spotify is the best out there any song you can think of they have it. Podcasts they got em. Spotify has helped me though my Moms death,my 26 year old Macaw Harley and Most of all My Daughter Amy 46 Years Old Died 5/04/2021 and Spotify is what helps me get get on Best I Can and I Thank Them. Best Online Music!! Try It.",5
"This app has great sound quality and is easy to use. I enjoy it. But I don't like how you have limited skips if you're a free listener and can't pick what song to play, the entire playlist just goes. I also don't like how the playlist automatically shuffles. What if you don't want it shuffled? Other than these issues and some pretty annoying but bearable ads, the app is great and I would recommend it.",2
"Don't get me wrong, I love Spotify, it's just.. how I customize my liked playlist and I play it like how some people do and what happens while playing it. Well what I'm trying to get at is I am not happy with how my liked playlist plays recommended songs that I have to spend all of my skips to get to a song I actually like! Thus has happened more than once and more often, it even happened today.",4
Listen to Spotify all day every day the BEST app out there for music🥰,5
"If y'all would like 5stars need more songs that are not posted. Step it up YouTube has all songs u desire and deserve. Plus it's free smh, so step it up Spotify!",4
Spotify has a great diversity of music. Terrific sound quality Spotify give you the best choices in any genre of music.,5
"Very slow, keeps crashing, removed car mode",1
I checked the app and i was right stations is better but now Spotify does not even connect to the internet,1
The only thing I have a hard time with can't find certain songs but otherwise I like it,5
"I really enjoy using Spotify, thia app makes music anytime, anywhere.",5
It continues to play a song that's not on one of my playlists when I try to play it,1
Easy and accessable for every song lyrics you want 💯%✓,5
Honestly the best app for music. Just hope that you could listen to songs offline bc some people cannot afford(or any other reason) unlimited data. For that 4 stars.,4
"It's ridiculous how glitchy this app is. I've been using spotify for years and I've never had this problem before. I'm trying to listen to music but everytime I try it won't let me download or view what I have downloaded, now I tried logging out logging back in, and none of my songs are showing up and playlist I have saved from other people, have no songs in them. This app keeps getting worse and worse please find somewhere else to get your music this isn't worth the hassle. Try harder spotify.",1
"This is worth every penny, especially when combined with my nest. It's so much better than that yt music junk app. I miss Google music, but whatever this app is awesome and pretty cheap, so I still say it's a win!",5
Spotify free added a new feature that makes it impossible to enjoy your liked songs playlist without adding back to back random songs that aren't even in the same genre of music you typically listen to. Overall just a begging for you to spend money on premium as if they don't have millions already. So stupid.,1
Music - 10/10 Price=8/10 Lyrics =8/10 now with lyrics but not really sincronized,4
"Too many ads, wrong adds. I am either classified by demographic or have an innacurate digital profile because all ads that I see are trash can fodder and mostly annoying.",3
Dont get this app it spends your data on stupid adds never get it😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎👎,4
Been using Spotify for over a year and still great. Thanx,5
I don't know what I did before Spotify existed,5
Where ever I go if it goes to school to showering I can always listen to the song podcast and more!,5
I love Spotify coz I can search any audio at any time,4
This app has a long way to go. It crashes and it still needs work.,3
Everything about Spotify Is ..SPOT ON !I Love All Kinds Of Music👍💗,5
"I have to cancel, or at least change my payment method for Spotify, but I can'f do it through the app and the website automatically redirects me to the app. I now have a $-54 balance due to overdraft fees and I can't pay that.",1
The App used to be great. Lately it is so ridiculously flawed I'm not even sure why I'm paying for premium anymore. To keep things short it simply doesn't function. Too must frustration for what its worth.,1
Love how user friendly it is!,5
"I have the premium because I'm music obsessed. I hope their pricing policy does not change. With give playlists - one of which has over 20 hours of songs - I could get billed for more than ten and change a month. So the limitless on the size of playlists is awesome, and I can look to add music at any time.",5
Really aggravated when you're listening to classic country with family and then No Filter by ASTAR starts playing.,3
All is good but ads are disturbing while listening songs either all are good in this App and have all songs,5
Great app to find and listen to music with basically no ads,5
Love the freedom of primer but I still get adverts.,3
"It's alright, too many ads to be better than getting CDs or an MP3, and not enough skips personally.",3
"I really enjoy listening to SPOTIFY, especially when there is an artist's music I want to listen to.",5
I love this honestly or her music apps are rip offs and this is so simple to use but I wish I could do 10 skips I've used this app 3+ years. But I would recommend this music app. <3,5
Best app for music hands down available on all platforms at an affordable price,5
"All right, Spotify has improved their flaws and bugs. Yay!!! Now it's back to greatness.",5
Offline mode doesn't actually work. Don't bother downloading through Spotify. There's sites that let you rip your playlist and actually download it,2
Spotify no problem. Really Love this app,4
It's a good app but could use some improvement.,4
App keeps crashing and have to re-open and restart app every 5 minutes,3
Spotify is better,4
"I love this app, I do not mind burning my Data. It gives me latest songs",5
Play a song and then close your device the music is still on or you play a game and the song is still on doing something like work still on amazing 1000000000000000000/10👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏,5
Hi I love this app so much but there is only 1 problem why I can't open ishowspeed shake song can. U please fix this ;( i can't quit this app I love it so much,5
"Still no higher resolution music, lol. It's laughable at this point 😂 Algorithms need to go deeper into alternate band suggestions. Also song suggestions played through the algorithm needs to go deeper into alternate song selection. Spotify usually only gives you the couple of popular songs. While your algorithm is written well, it thin in it's results. Thanks",1
Great playlists to make you dance,5
Adds might be annoying for sleep and I don't feel like paying premium,4
"Spotify needs to add a way to selectively move more songs at once from one playlist to another. And we need more pins for playlists, 4 aren't enough",4
Turns off stops all the time the worst app ever,1
"I would've given 5 stars but the app, it's logged out from spotify. And I can't log in anymore. Pls fix the app!!",4
I love Spotify there are no ads if you subscribe which is worth every penny and there are hundreds of thousands of songs and podcasts to listen to and if you have children who like music there is a restricted setting. So 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ and 5 hearts ❤❤❤❤❤ for you Spotify.,5
Too many ads :/,4
I love this app! It's very user friendly and has a huge selection of music!,5
Good app great for podcasts and motivation,5
It's wass good but premium is too expensive,5
Picking my playlists and creating them is easy and comfy,5
I have no clue why people put bad Reviews on this app it is actually not as bad as these people describe it. There is adds but how else would they make money I mean there's not that many sooo that should not be something to be complained about. This app has a variety of songs so I think this app it amazing.,5
the only thing i dont like is that i cant close the app and have music playing still. A habit of mine to clear out my apps.,4
App is constantly crashing. Also constantly adds songs to my que although I turned off the song suggestion option. Make it make sense.,1
Love how Spotify automatically connects to my car. No need to go into my phone and open the app.,5
Too much ads are there even when Spotify showed 30min of ad free music I've seen ads.,1
"I really like the app, I would give Spotify a 5 star rating if there weren't so many adds and premium features, on my Xbox it lets me choose what songs I want to listen to and have infinite skips. But when I'm on my phone I have to shuffle play random songs, I also don't like how Spotify adds songs to my playlist, I keep hiding them but there are more getting added every day, I would appreciate it if you guys would just have a recommendation list under the songs, but don't play them.",4
Easy-to-use and so much music,4
I like Spotify because it's different from the other musical apps that I have and I like the moving pictures with some of the songs ☺️,4
"Works well in this build. No crashes or anything. I like the interface but it definitely could be designed better to access certain features or lists. Still, great app overall.",4
"Great UI, expansive catalogue, and instantaneous music starts. It's the head of the pack, currently.",5
I would literally DIE if I didn't have my premium... Been using this for almost 12yrs and have discovered so much beautiful music thank you Spotify if I didn't have my doggo you'd be my best friend!,5
Please can you fix thiss i cant log into my acount and it is a premium acount since last night please fix thiss,3
"I absolutely hate this app now. You took away everything i loved about it, I can no longer loop the songs nor can I play a song when a different song is playing. I updated it and that is not the issue. I HIGHLY do NOT recommend this WHATSOEVER.",1
Too many ads,1
I have a lot of ads,5
The app is just great I don't get a commercial after every song and this is just my go to app for music 😃.,5
Pretty much unusable in mobile unless you listen to podcasts or buy premium,1
The best 1000 percent u can find any song and music,5
"Works great and the option to download songs and music is handy, did have a problem with playing music while my phone was off or the app not on screen and it would suddenly stop playing music but I reinstalled and waiting to see if it's fixed.",5
Its good. One of the Legal free music apps :),5
"I used to use this all the time. But recently it deleted everything I had on my Playlist, and forgot who I was, and I've already tried deleting it and reinstalling it. It didn't fix it. What the hell Spotify? Why did your mobile app forget who I was but not my ps4 app version?",1
"Earlier Spotify had 1 advertisement at a time inbetween, then it becomes 2 addvertisement at a time, now it become 3 addvertisement at a time.",4
Add an option to clear the whole queue in one go! Takes too phone storage.,3
"App has become so buggy lately, it's constantly crashing/pausing my playlists and doesn't show content as ""playing"" when it is currently is so have to force close the whole app in order to stop playback. Getting frustratingly harder to put up with so might just move to another platform if it doesn't get fixed soon",2
This app is great and easy to use i blend with BTS thanks to Spotify,5
Would like a seek bar on android auto.,4
I want translate lyrics feature in English 🤧 I want to listen BTS music wid English subtitles on Spotify ❤️,4
Actually this app is so amazing i love it it gives me what i want. You guys should keep it up i love this app very nice 👌👌,5
Why are the ads way louder than the music?? They play 3 ads between only 2 songs. The premium price is high like Netflix. You can't go through albums and add songs you have to type each individual song to add. You can only add a lot through other Playlist but not artist albums.,1
Music on tap and music for the moment.,5
"No option to cancel subscription, and the only other option is filling out a professional letter on why I'm cancelling my plan, which is the most unnecessary thing ever, not one company has done this before or proven to be this incompetent with its own management for subscriptions",1
"Been a Spotify Premium member for years and wouldn't change a thing. It's the gold standard in streaming music. Quite simply, Apple Music was too late to the party and I've never felt the need to switch. Spotify gets everything right, hands down.",5
The music quality is amazing! Music is my stress relief and Spotify makes it an easy way to feel better. I love creating new playlists (I have like wayyyyy to many lmao.) Spotify premium with no adds is also definitely worth the money! I remember when I used to have to listen to adds and it really killed the vibe. 11/10 would recommend !!!!,5
Best way to listen to the type of music I enjoy. Fantastic.,5
The music that mixes with my library is very good I like it 👌,5
Very good collection of songs,5
I dont know why there is no option to select song language in this app on Android 12,3
Closes randomly during podcasts. No clue why S22 galaxy,2
"spotify is pretty amazing i'd say, but recently the new update im not sure but there's this update abt the widget colour being blue, n in my opinion it's kind of ugly, before this the widget coulour would change according to the album cover but idk what happened now its only blue, maybe its the new update but i hope to get the previous one back, it looks so much better n nicer.",3
"Seriously? I'm taking back 4 stars back. Heard ""Dekhu tuje ya kudrat ke najare"" even though I don't give a blink about this type of songs; heard the advertisement one week in a row repeatedly. If your ads are good I'll consider upgrading one day. Thank you.",1
Spotify is okay but sometimes when I'm looking for an artist and want to play a full album they put me in the artist radio which plays random artists of that style difficult to determine what I want,3
"It doesn't work properly. Constantly shuts off middle of songs, the play bar doesnt show, fed up with it honestly. Gonna switch to a diff music streamer",1
Shittiest app ever every time I go to a song I pick it goes to some random song I've never heard before,1
"They killed (deprecated, as they say) support for the app to function with my Pioneer stereo, and that was the only reason to have it. Considering cancelling my paid sub and looking for something else.",1
All the music I want whenI want it.,5
Best music app in history ☺️,5
"I highly recommend Spotify for those that love listening to their favorite music, as well as making their own playlists.",5
The greatest music App Ever created wow!,5
I love listening to music and listening to podcasts 😌 boywithuke long drives this is one of my favorite song's,5
Awesome music app where you can listen to the music from your own library or suggested daily mixes and different genres.,5
Horrible when I make a Playlist it always adds songs I don't care about or don't like,1
"Basically, its none of the much, but it is in concerned with the privacy of users. So, I would like to point it out. ""In android there is a feature which allows users to hide all notification in screen lock. But spotify does not follow the same."" In next update make sure to get this one. Overall, app is doing great.",3
I just love the app and I am using it since long,5
Why did you have to remove Driving Mode? It was perfect. Now I have to use alternatives that are not even close to what Driving Mode was.,3
Love that I can download the music I love!So easy to use!!!,5
Spectacular and moving. Loved it...,4
"Music is downloaded, still won't show songs without an Internet connection. Once is looses a connection the app needs re starting again before it'll search",1
Very best app. Great. But reduce the ads.,5
In the new update a feature has been deleted. Like when you want to add songs to one of your playlists you cannot play the demo part So it's impossible to add songs that have the same vibe as your playlist... I also would like a feature that you can chat with your friends on spotify and send them music...,3
Best app for listening songs :),5
I wish we can download the songs and please the management should add sleep timer option in the settings no other objections but the app is very good,5
Spotify has stopped working on my phone. It wont load at all.,1
I pay for premium and still get ads. Ads are flaming piles of ****. £14 a month for my podcasts to be interupted by adverts.,1
Paying for premium..can't access my download song without data fix this please,3
"Does not work on VIVO X80 PRO !!!!!!!!!!! You hear that, Spotify support team ???? Thank you for the newest version update, it works beautifully !!! You screwed it up again with the latest version 🤬 7th June 22 : now the latest version works !!! Please make sure future updates are workable for VIVO X80 PRO 21st June 22: now I dare not update, afraid that the latest version don't work!???",1
Crashes repeatedly. Has come to the point where it's not even worth fighting with to listen to music and podcasts.,2
I've been using Spotify for years and it's only gotten better! Best music app!,5
"Asks me to turn on Bluetooth, every time i start/change to the app",1
Best streaming platform I've used soo far,4
Works good. Good music,5
I think Spotify is great! However we should have the option mixes if we want the clean or explicit version. It's the same song we might as well be able to choose. Because sometimes I need to choose. I also feel we should be able to peek at the next song before we skip it. We only get 6 skips an hour I don't want to use them if I don't have to.,4
After update Spotify Start laging when we play a song it takes a second to start the song,1
The thing I love about Spotify is if you have something you're listening to and you listen to it can you come back the next day and listen to it again I just love this app and it has every song you can think of.,5
"THIS APP IS THE BEST! But When i make playlist, Spotify says that he put random songs in, so that's IRITATING! (pls fix that🥺)",5
Definitely helps the work day pass much smoother,5
"I regret every minute I had not realised there such an app, I really love it.",5
"I don't like Spotify at first but my gf insisted on getting the premium, and I fell in love. You can download songs for offline. Skip songs. Love it.",5
"5 stars if you have premium. By far best music and podcast service. Totally worth paying for premium, especially if you can do a Family, duo, or student plan. Without premium ads are very annoying, and you can't select songs, only shuffle playlists.",5
I have been using Spotify for many years. It is an amazing music player I have ever seen.,5
"how are you about to give me 3 ads, let 1 song play, THEN give me 3 MORE ads?",3
"This app consistently disconnects every Bluetooth device when I open it. I can use every other app and Bluetooth device without issue, yet Spotify routinely disconnects my devices upon opening. New changes to the UI make it more difficult to see artists catelogue and to select desires music. I use this app because it holds my playlists and my friends upload their content on it. Otherwise, I use YouTube and simply skip ads after 5 seconds.",2
"It's nice, the only thing is that the ads are like 30 second long.",3
One of the best music app ever I see,5
Easy to use! Great options for listening!,5
Whatever you do don't switch plans you will get bill twice an Spotify will make it seem likes its your fault an will not credit your account.,1
"I do love my spot. The only thing that bugs me, (NOT SPOTIFYS FAULT) is when the artists pull their music. But hey, it's their choice, their money. I have premium so I never get ads.",5
Please can there be an option to download music for offline? Thank you,3
"Ads are like commercial breaks (I have had 8 ads one time) and several songs I listen to are blocked. And when I turn my phone off and listen, the music will skip like a CD.",2
Very good app lots of content available for listening,5
I had a good experience 😌 in listening the song it's makes me 😊 happy and relax me and one thing I Don't need to care about the screen off because when it's screen off it's playing on and it is auto shuffling 🎵🎵🎵,5
At first it was good then this annoying update came now I can't play the song I want in my playlists and I can't skip I don't like this new update.please fix it,1
"I don't really like how you can't listen to previews when you press the add songs button ( new update, free version) can you please change it back.",4
please let us people who don't have premium turn off shuffle playlist,1
Superb app very less ads i am happy 👍✌️,5
Good music Good app no ads,5
It's great but I only gave it four stars because you have to pay to listen to it offline and to skip unlimited songs and I understand they use it to make money I just wish it was different,4
"If you like loud music Spotify is not for you, I have premium and I tried all the settings and equalizer and the volume doesn't compare to SoundCloud or others. Every app sounds fine in headphones except for Spotify. Volume limiting is un-American and shouldn't be allowed or what's the point of having expensive headphones?",1
Too much add can't stop add need to buy premium package for ad free music such a pathetic experience,1
"great, but there are adds 24/7",5
It's really hard to find the song you want they are mixed,2
"it's not playing the song i was clicking, kindly fix it?",1
"Force closes too often, can't report problems because that force closes too",2
They are giving soo much ad hardly you can listen 2 song. After 2 song ad will come,1
Once was innovative and well-engineered application. Now it just simply stops playing for no reason.,1
I've used spotify for awhile now and I really like it the only thing I've figured out recently was that you can no longer play a clip of the song while you are putting it on your playlist which allows you to hear the song before you add it. I honestly think you guys should but it back because maybe people would like to hear the song before adding it to their playlist because I sure do,4
Why does a music streaming app take up 5GB of memory space when I don't even download the music,1
Song recommendations can be better. Many songs overlap in different playlists,4
I downloaded songs and they're not playing why I'm paying for them so I should be able to listen to all of my with on promises right the song that's not downloaded is playing come on now get right I'm paying money to listen my music from spotify I have told others people about spotify and now you're messing up come on now get it right.,3
"I'm not a fan of the Only 6 skips per hour thing for people like me who don't have premium lol But I like spotify, recommendations of songs are amazing too",3
I put my liked songs on shuffle and it plays the same 30 songs on a loop.,1
I love this app so much i can listen to every single music in high quality. I just have a little bit problem with ads or nothing,4
"This is the first time I have used this app, so I don't have much to report. So far I like it... I'll leave another comment about this once I use it a bit.",5
Just deleted this app because they play songs that are not even part of the playlist which is annoying. 👎👎👎👎,1
"It's good,, but middle middle add's problem. Please remove add's. Tq",5
This app is very good and very comfortable to use you can also see lyrics and sound experiance is very good and there is no risk for hacking i have 6 years experience for spotify,5
The app is really very good. It is easy to use. The only drawback is the mistakes in lyrics,1
So far so good....No problems as yet.,5
I love the songs that are on Spotify,5
"i love this app because i can create 3 a.m playlist altough my account not premium, but still overall i say thanxfull",5
Super easy to use and the best app ever,5
"It's a good app, but really restricting for free user.",2
"I don't know why I can download songs, because the app doesn't work without internet and sometimes not even with it.",2
Your irritating ads every 10 mins are not encouraging me to buy premium but rather switch to switch to some other app.,3
It was really a great app I can listen musics ofc its great 👍😊,4
For some reason I can't listen to my Spotify on any of my Bluetooth devices. Really upset with this!!!! Don't know that I will continue with this app.,4
Incredible! I love this app!,5
"Well aside from even the non premium still being good, If you are a student, couple, family or just a single person trying to not have ads they have premium for you with special offers. Also if you don't want to pay the price they always have deals that pop up if you have been using them! I got 3 months of premium for just $1 that is insane I love it.",5
"The control panel(where I can see which song us playing or I can pause/play a song) doesn't appear , app is not functional at all like this",1
Best music streaming app,5
Better than I thought... damn! Keep the awesome work.,5
I love it i can find diffrent kinds of songs without a problem,5
"I use this app all of the time on multiple different devices, and it's always great. I don't have premium so I get ads, but I wish the ads were almost always different. Most of the time it ends up being like the same 5",4
The music app that I am most fond of.,5
"Premium is worth it, and I'd rate this at 5 stars if they would put more effort into the Premium exclusive group sessions and make it actually work better other then that it's a good App for music and works great on Xbox and phone",4
I'm not able to add some song in playlist 😞😞,1
Good for music BUT TOO MANY ADS,2
Please add a multi select feature,5
"I cant even play the songs i want to listen, it has to be on the random playlist",1
The app is always crashing always has trouble loading podcasts. The worst is when an add comes on and after the add is done the podcast I'm listening to skips right to the end. Total waste of time,1
Keeps crashing and won't play my downloaded episodes without my data being on. Which defeats the purpose,1
It's a good app ! Just needs more variety in the mixing.,4
This app has solved lots of problems to people around the world and is also very helpful ...thus is a great and very reliable app,5
I have to keep re downloading the app because the app freezes on a song or podcast episode which means it will carry on playing without the possibility to change to another episode.,1
APP KEEPS CRASHING. Trash back-end.,1
Lovely to have all your music at your fingertips.,5
Super easy to use,5
"Seamless streaming, intuitive recommendations and every artist you could hope to find.",5
This is the best music stream app ever ❤,5
"i absolutely love this, gotta say. i listened to this app when im doing my homework, on my free time, even on an online exam. it keeps me feel relaxed and calm. the ads rarely pops up for me. thanks devs. edit: okay, okay i take my word back. the ads are freaking everywhere. please at least make it pops up less because not everyone can buy premium :].",4
ONLY ONE STAR BC IF I PLAY MY FAV SONG IT WON'T PLAY IT INSTEAD DAY PLAY OTHER SONG SO I GET ANNOYED WITH IT SO I ONLY GONNA GIVE IT ONE STAR IT SUPPOSED TO UPDATE IT PLSS REMOVE THAT,1
Crystal clear quality of sound and quick update of new release,5
When i play music from this apps my brain is relaxing. This is my stress reliever,5
Great if have had premiom beside no ads there is no benefit to me because I can't download or switch to mp3 player or burn for cds I'm old school and like my cds,3
"The largest selection of music, podcasts and easy to use",5
"PLEASE amend the shuffle feature. Based on my own many hour user experience and conversing with other users, the shuffle feature isn't a true shuffle. It seems to queue up songs that you have played on repeat. I would prefer if the shuffle was a true randomised selection. PLEASE LONG TIME PAYER SINCE 2012.",3
"This app has over a 100 songs but there's still a lot of songs,albums and even podcasts that it is missing. If there's an app that has lot's of songs I want A LOT. Also why is there so many blocked songs like time/Breathe reprise by the flaming lips. Some of the missing songs are time travel YES...!! by the flaming lips on at war with the mystics and the divel went down to Georgia by primus on rhinoplasty. The adds are not a problem which is good .",2
The best site with no ads,5
Good experience overall but still some songs are missing.,4
This is a great . I listen to a lot of foreign music 🎵 ican find everything I search for I search for.,5
This app gives me reason to listen songs,5
"I've got premium. Only issue lately is that Spotify won't play while I've got pokemon go running, so it's either pokemon or music. Barely choose music.",5
Stop changing songs i wanna listen to this sucks so much,1
"Ads are too long, shuffle play is not good.",2
"I love this app. I was on JOOX, until it subtracted from South Africa. I find Spotify way better. The suggested tracks and albums created for me is cool. I just mis that I could give my own compilation folders a single image of my own on Joox. I will give 5 stars if that could be added.",4
Great app! User friendly,5
I thoroughly enjoy the app it's super easy to use and the search results are endless from Playlist to song I've never known exist from artists I love,5
"Its decent, however i cant preview the songs when i listen to other peoples playlists.",2
y'all need to make it cheaper,4
clear and crispy sounds of music....very nice to listen specially at bedtimes,5
This is a cool app!!! Tho it sometimes plays i different song but i dont care about that i just care about the cool songs i love :D,5
Very good app you serach all type of song 1990 to 2222 i love it Thank you so much,5
It's ok. It plays music @ 160Kbit... Meh,3
My gosh the auto play is turned off background battery is restricted. Music continues to start playing irregardless of whether you shut off all the abilities. Hey spotify if you want your app on my phone. How about you let me control when it's running?,1
Amazing. Best podcast app ever. Go check out Scared To Death!,5
The song recommendation are always off for me.,2
I've recently installed the app but the songs dont play and all the playlists are empty so can't play them either because it directs me to main page.,1
this app is nice but I gave it a 4 star because it glitches,4
I can listen to some songs in this app!,5
keeps crashing on pc,1
"I've been using Spotify for quite a long time. But lately whenever I play a playlist, it doesn't play the songs that are suppose to be made by the artist. It just plays other songs that aren't even in the playlist. I only want to listen to songs by my fav artist playlist but it keeps playing other songs.",2
Many advertisements comes in this app,1
"I like this app because I can listen to songs even if we exit the app, the song is still played and we can control it through other devices, only we use the phone and it's better than YouTube music",5
I love the app very much the only thing is after the new update I've how do I put this on a good way I've been not rlly liking the new update can you pls fix it. ( I really wanna play my fav song :'D ),3
I enjoy all the songs of your app,4
Best music player ever! 😋,5
Spotify is the best music app,5
Good app.Problem is too many adverts,4
Everything is great But ads are very irritating I know if iam not premium then ads will be there but insted of products and all you choose to ruin the moment which is not good It's kinda blackmail,3
"The app crashes now after the update. It now removes the song that I was playing but I can change to a different song but doesn't highlight in green. What was that for??? Totally uncalled for especially that I pay for Spotify premium. Really don't like the new changes at all. FIX IT IMMEDIATELY!!! **Edit**: The update is alot better, 4 stars!!",4
When I get to play a song in my Playlist random songs come that I did not add to my playlist,1
"Too many ads,Worst app I have ever used.",1
"Great interface with other apps!! Love you guys!!...Great sound definition too!! You clean up an original artists sound with augmentation to increase sound quality...well done!! So apps I have subscribed to leave me feeling very much ""let Down""...but not you guys. I am glad I have spent my money WISELY. To all you audiophiles out there check out this ""APP YOU WILL BE RIGHT BACK"".......I promise ..Great App!!",5
"It is awesome, i have the free version. I don't mind the adds, I just don't like the fact that they are so loud. I find the right volume I want, and then bam an add, it is really frustrating.",4
"The best app ever I love Spotify alot, the music and everything",5
Brilliant App... very functional and apt for the gospel music uses I desire of it etc.,5
You need to allow reporting ads. Some are VERY disturbing and disrupting.,1
It's awful after it asks for a rating even you do it you cant listen what you to anymore it takes you to a random playlist and you can only click shuffle and maybe if your lucky you can eventually listen to the song you wanted,1
Since past few months the app stops while playing songs suddenly without doing so and I have kept the app updated and also have a good internet connection still the issue is persistent please can you look into it.,1
Every time when i open this app and play a song i had to see 2 ads which is very annoying asking to buy subscription again and again This is worst thing in this app,1
I really love listening to music with it,5
Great music selection. Loved the BTS videos.,5
"LAGGG, I think this is a good app idea, whenever I play, pause, switch, or change a song my phone glitches out & turns off, it even happens when the songs automatically switch during playlists & also i go to play a song & it just gives me the recommended song 😩",1
I can't login back...i have tried the mail link and OTP..... please help me to login... Spotify customer care!!,3
Poor app it's not working,1
"Good music experience, really worth the premium subscription... Always there for me in every different moods",5
Fantastic app. Best music ever. Anything you looking for old or new you'll sure find it here,5
"They've purposely made free so infuriating. I get 30 mins no ads so while listening to a chill, relaxed playlist it randomly throws in some drill? Why!?",1
"App is good, sound quality and every music and podcast is present but too many ads...",5
"Bring back the dislike button, then we can talk",3
I am rating this app 1 star because Spotify removed a very important feature i.e. removing the recently played. That feature was very much needed because you might accidentally play something you didn't mean to,1
"Since my last review was deleted....long story short disgusting monetized app, since you guys make lots of money from the adds you guys put avery 2-3 songs (like 2-3 adds)....why block some futures under premium? Im sure u guys make same money from adds....uninstall and forget spotify exists!!!! 😡",1
Easy for a novice to use!,5
"Normally a good app, but the bug where Spotify randomly closes itself is back. Especially once you lock the screen",2
"I've strong network connection but sometimes this app shows there is a network problem so that lyrics can't be load. Don't know why does it happens! And after 2 or 3 Times reboot, the app shows the lyrics, you know when you're looking for lyrics and lyrics aren't here, it ruins the mood",3
Takes care of all shade music and I love it. Yes it makes me happy,5
Great sound quality and wide selection of songs,5
Song all are good have good quality and all but even though I'm online it is showing offline and can't get songs while I'm searching and also can't get the lyrics bcs it shows offline,2
there is a new feature where it doesn't let u add songs to playlists or to queue without playing the song which is very inconvenient,3
"I've had this for 2 and a half years. Incredibly happy, works amazing for me. However, I can no longer sign in to my account onto my phone and that is driving me mad. I had written the password down and never changed it. I could get into my email that the account is registered to my account, only it's has parental control's and my mom won't allow me into it until im 18, for whatever reason. It won't even allow me in, with the saved password in settings. Please explain this to me.",3
This app is very bad cant download music,1
Less interruption of the music...,5
"For me it is perfect music app,respect🧝‍♂️",5
I tried so hard to play music in spotify but it doesn't work :(,1
"So Inconsistent. Sometimes it works great, but most of the time it is glitching out, stopping my music randomly and not allowing me to use the queue. Such a joke considering this is a paid subscription, I should be getting a refund for the last year of this BS.",1
I love the app It is a lovely app to play music Despite the data usage to download a song the app itself is not bad. Even though in overall the best app,5
Constantly cutting out. Since the last update this app is unuseable due to constantly cutting out every 30-40 seconds. I have other music apps on my phone that work without issue. I can't believe I'm paying a premium subscription for this rubbish. I will not be renewing.,1
I can't see the play button and I don't want to do random and the new update sucks u need to pay to skip your songs and put they put ads I'm deleting Spotify it trash now. U can't pick the music u want. Spotify is Trashhhhhhhhh,1
My Spotify lyrics is not open,2
"Works well enough on WiFi, but when using mobile data it consistently freezes, or registers as offline while other apps can get a signal without issue.",3
I'm actually giving like 4.9 stars just because I can't select multiple songs at once.,5
Bruh it woulda be good if they didn't make it so u have to do a million things to play one song the other it was just normal press the video and play know we have to more than that it makes it difficult u guys are very ignorant use your brains make everything simple what do u want? Cash u make millions per year what more do u want huh make it simple very easy dumbasses,2
"Very good app, I really enjoy it. But I don't see the option to download songs into my playlist. That I don't have to use data Everytime am listening to the same songs",5
Great for listening to music and podcasts,5
I can't play one music when I search the music that I want...🤔,5
Good app but glitchy sometimes but generally good.,5
The new update is annoying i like the old spotify,1
"You guys need to fix your stupid updates.....for the past 3 months my downloaded songs keep deleting for no reason and I have enough storage space I've been redownloading everything. playlist, liked songs and all repeatedly.....fix this!!! It's annoying",2
"This app is really amaizing. I love this app, we canfound all song here. I give it 5star, because it's really trusted app Spotify",5
UI is back to normal now but I keep getting a premium tab even tho I already have premium. Doesnt affect anything and just returns me to where I last was but kinda weird,5
When you have premium with no ads or recommended songs it's really good and you can listen offline and all the fun things plus you can listen to stuff on repeat which is nice. So in all this app is a great music streaming app,5
Keeps skipping even with full 5G service. Pandora plays straight through on same signal with no problem so I know it's this app.,1
"Ads are out of control, an ad every 2 songs and sometimes it will play 2 30 sec ads in a row or play a 20 minute ad that i can't skip while I'm working",1
"I mean, some of the songs I wanna listen to are free on here that aren't on Spotify. I don't get why I can't have a single song on a playlist without having to shuffle through a bunch of others that were recommended to me. I can't even choose which one I gotta listen to. It's just shuffle until it plays. Honestly a horrible design in general.",1
Very good app for listenind every type of music🤗🤗,5
Most reliable streaming app which brings my favorite songs🔥🔥,4
"Since the update Spotify won't play the next episode of a podcast, or the next song in an album or playlist. Instead, a random song plays and even after trying to go back to the playlist or podcast and physically tapping the next in queue, it plays another random song and keeps doing that until the 4th or 5th tap when it FINALLY selects the song...only to play another random song after. This is a ridiculous bug I'm paying for.",1
Best music app cause they keep it simple Some things are worth waiting for and I love you Music. Thanx 4 Sharing.,5
I love this app here all song come out english urdu hindi punjabi everything i give 5 stars to this app,5
well the advertisement between songs sucks but still I love this app the most heheh thankuuuu,5
Keeps cutting off and doesn't show what's playing,3
Music when I need! On the go or just relaxing Spotify will meet any music demands! 👊🏽💯💯,5
It's a good app for music lovers.,4
Indeed No.1 music app in india no doubt with so many active users and so many cool features so yeah i personally would like to give them like 100 of stars but that no tpossible so yeah nice work Spotify staff team for maintaing the app so nicely 😄,5
Would Be perfect if they added more songs. It would definitely beat YouTube music. Only thing holding it back,4
Good app.. But why do it says uninterrupted music when there are actually interruptions while the music is played!!,2
Good it is just so limited without subscription,2
Pretty good music app i have many favorite songs i just hate that when i want to hear my favorite music it changes to other music i don't want to hear and that are not even in my liked section or stuff like that,4
Great place to listening music,5
I love it. Wide spectrum of offerings.,5
Always crashes. Worst app ever. Only have it because of Rogan,1
So far better than streaming MP3's on your phone so much better especially for all of us poor people in this covid time of time of breaking businesses so I guess everything is free now and that as well be because people are working so hard for no reason we might as well listen to something that's peaceful. But don't get me wrong we should still work. Only because we want to and we should do it just to help.,5
Crashes whenever I try to add music to my playlist,5
"The ease, price point, and quality of the streaming service make this an excellent music application. A radio edit section or censored section would make it even easier to operate.",5
I downloaded Spotify a couple of minutes ago and while using the app it kicked me out and I tried and tried but it's won't let me! I deleted it and right now I'm installing it back so hopefully it works! (I'll change my review when it works) Update: It works now! ‹3,5
"I really hate this app, i can't even listen to the music i like because you have to be premium, really don't recommend this and would prefer any othe music app",1
Some times u get an ad after 2 songs. Sometimes u get 20 mins of music before listening to an add. Was 5 stars but now 3 stars,3
I regret downloading this app. YouTube music is a lot better. I don't understand why I am listening to a song I'm not able to prepare fora song that I would like to play next. I have to scroll throuh My list of songs and then wait for the song to finish and then press the next song. YouTube music doesn't do this. Also I hate the exit button on this app. I have to go and manually press one of the symbols on the app for me to get out of a certain song instead of just pressing the back button,2
Love my music and to be able to play anywhere great deals with accounts for whole family,5
"Its a music app that works well on PC or phones, and other then an ad every 30 minutes or so it's great.",5
go to music app for almost 10 years,5
Thing i hate in old spotify im premium but my storage is full and i delete then i uninstall apps and i down load now but i can't restore purchase please fix it,3
I have been using this amazing app for 2 years now and I have no complaints.I have never used a better music app in my life.,5
I usually listen to Spotify on PlayStation and like every other song it'll cut out so I'd have to either repeat the song or play the next one. Fix it please,1
I had to delete this bc it was playing songs that weren't on my playlist and I couldn't fix it,3
Tooooo much of ad.simply waste.pls avoid so many ads.,2
It's great has anything you might be interested in!!,5
"Spotify in a nutshell: ""hey this person is genuinely enjoying this song/playlist & playing it often. Y'know what, let's hoard it away & put a bunch of ads in it so that if that person has depression or something worse & this song makes them happy, they can't listen to it! I mean, who cares what they want/do to themselves unless they're paying for premium! 😀"" Music is power & you're taking that away with this bs. I'm giving this 4 stars since u don't respond to ur 1 star reviews. fix the system.",4
Idk what's wrong with this app .it's says no internet connection on the search page even tho I'm listening to music at the same time I can't search for any songs i could only play songs from my playlist.now I'm not even able to login my account .fix this asap,1
"It's not letting me access my liked songs and many other Playlists on my phone. However, it let's me access all of my Playlists on my Xbox.",4
"Easy UI, infinite range of podcasts and etc. I love Spotify",5
"Ehhh, does the job on the phone but having issues with offline listening, seems like i need reception to access my downloaded music, which really defeats the purpose. And i hope im not the only one , but functionality on my gw4 classic is basically none.even after many resets,redownloads, and a new e-sim",3

"Able to turn my Spotify & listen riding Amtrak, YOga, Excersie classes & traveling in my car too.",5
Easy to use and navigate.,5
"i have premium but with my downloaded playlists some songs just arent downloaded and i cant play them offline, even tho it says all my songs are downloaded :(( i tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app before and it started working again, but it went back to before and i cant keep doing that as i have very limited space on my phone. pls fix this issue.",1
"The update is absolutely disappointing. I shuffled my ""liked songs"" and then suddenly another song which I never had heard started playing. I tried to skip it, but more random songs kept playing! From what I remember, it's just my liked songs. I never heard those songs before. Even if I try to skip all the songs, it wouldn't work because apparently we could only skip a few songs per hour, please let people listen to music in peace. Might aswell just use ytube.",1
I literally just downloaded the app but I think it's amazing because it has good music and it plays your music even when your not on the app,5
Why the hell are there so many ads that try to get you to by spotify premium,1
"I absolutely, positively love ❤️ this app.",5
"Works pretty well, good music selection. Has the same issues as Spotify on a pc.",4
Love it listen to it daily,5
I love it I work in a place where you get no signal I mean zero signal on the floor and I can listen to my podcast all day if I just download it here I love this app I'm happy I found it,5
"I use to have spotify in a tablet and in the spotify I would pick the song I wanted to listen, my playlist would go in order, and the best thing is that I could change the other of the songs from my playlist from my favorite to less favorite it was awesome I did like that, but the phone version is horrible I can't even pick the song I want to listen to the songs come all random and the worst thing is the I can't even order my songs from my playlist 😡 so spotify fix your app pls 👍",1
STOP MAKING ME PLAY YOU STUPID RECOMMENDED SONGS I WANNA PLAY MY OWN SONGS IM UNINSTALLING THIS APP,1
"I have a premium subscription, if I play a song radio I cannot choose individual songs, I can only play shuffle. Please fix this bug and I will give 5 star (it's extremely annoying)",1
I love it but if you don't have a connection it's useful,5
Best app ever super fast extremly useful and best music and podcast just about anything you can think of they got it and its completly free,5
"1) If I search for a song, I dont want a shuffled playlist that contains that song somewhere in it. I want to listen to that song. 2) Why does changing playlists/songs instantly start another round of ads for 30min of ad free music, if I literally just got done listening to 3 ads saying I have 30min of free music? Get more accuracy and less ads on Youtube all places...",2
Love just about everything except the 30 minute ad free feature no longer works. App is up to date and after watching an ad to get 30 minutes ad free you're lucky if you get 10 to 15 minutes before another set of ads. Without that 5 stars no problem.,4
Ver good songs app in every language,5
Dude. Been trying to open the app for days. I have premium and it's getting wasted ugh.,4
It's great because you can sit back and relax Wyle listening to Spotify,5
I enjoy the old school music from the 60 and 70 r&b jazz thank you,5
"Great selection of music, but lyrics, not so much.",4
"You know why I hate this app, the old version was so good there was no premium and other ads. Spotify got worse!",1
Best music app out..HANDS DOWN,5
This app crashes 10 times a day without fail. Fix this garbage.,1
seriously so good. their system is great. music wow 😻.,5
3 because they add other song to your playlist thats all,3
It adds songs to my playlist that I never wanted on there. And the 30 minutes no ads thing is only about 10.,2
Outstanding on every level....Premium is well worth it,5
It's good for music but I really don't like it when it mixes up my songs with ones that aren't on my Playlist it really makes me mad and when I can reshuffle to not listen to those songs,3
No matter what I do I can't make it play jre podcasts offline and even if I'm playing with an internet connection it still glitches and won't work if I pause it for more then a few seconds. It will also stop working after commercials play and sometimes randomly skip to a different podcast and lose all progress on the previous one. But I can't get jre anywhere else so I'm stuck with this garbage. Update this app still super sucks if you can find an alternative then run away from this app!,1
Excellent at all times,4
Easy to filter and set favorites,5
"You are celebrating black artists this month, which month is for white artists? ""Inclusion is Universal"", unless you are of European descent. How long has Spotify been using racism in advertising? Perhaps an Ombudsman should be contacted.",1
It's absolutely good app comparing others for listening every type of music without any trouble,5
"A great place to catalog your music, but but everytime they update this app. They make it objectively worse. For some reason everytime they make it harder to find tour music and it infuriates me to no end",2
"App no longer works properly for me. I can start music or a podcast but it stays on a blank home screen. Doesn't show what's currently playing at all. Also can't pause or interact in any way with toolbar. The only way to stop a song or podcast is to completely close the app. Cleared the cache and checked for updates but nothing. The last time Spotify worked properly for me was when I paid for premium, which is interesting. The only thing stopping me from deleting is that Pandora is somehow worse",1
Ease of use. It would great if the app can remember the lat podcast I was on.,5
"Amazing. I love it so much, it's very good quality. It has all the songs I like. Don't really have that much to say except for it's a really amazing app.",5
Any other music app os better than this,1
"Update: still having issues with this app working properly. And months later this still happens only now just about every time I try and start listening to a podcast, the app will shut down repeatedly! Also this app uses more battery power than a streaming app like Amazon prime. It's absurd.",1
Love my Spotify Premium!,5
"Cool, stress less, and satisfying",5
I hate how there's adverts then 2 songs you can't skip. I'm sorry but I'm not buying premium either. The app use to be better. Now it's horrible,1
"I'm fairly new to the app, but I've love listening pretty much all day long - with only breaks to charge my ear buds! I've exclusively been listening to BTS and there are some great suggestions that I hadn't heard yet. So Thanks, Spotify! I like that I can add to favorites & there's a cool feature to also skip songs (which the button is too close to the Next button, but that's cuz I shove my phone in a pocket and it's accessible from the lock screen- which is handy and not sometimes) Thank you!",3
Finding searching played a lot Travis Scott Kanye West Jay z musics highest hits Spotify has best bet VEVO utmost hard to get some played Spotify relates source finds quality ensuring listeners,5
Listening to 2 songs = hearing 7 ads,1
The cerator of this app you need fix all the bugs with your app,1
"It's the made for you list, it just repeats every song I liked, and also it's recommendation kinda bad too, I can't seem to find new songs I hardly find one every week I sure am picky but SoundCloud recommendations better",4
"What's happened? Spotify just stop working with no reason. Since the last update the app just stop off working for NOTHING. The Spotify's premium users, should have more quality. What's whong?",1
Thanks for bringing back the playlist button. Now it's perfect.,5
The app is very slow and stopped working so I contacted customer support and was passed around to 8 people who all just kept telling me to logout and login again and Uninstall then reinstall. In 5 hours 1 person actually was useful until they just asked dumb questions again. I have not been able to listen to anything since right after I was billed and when I asked for a refund it said I couldn't bc is was past 14 days but I paid on the 6th and it's the 19th so it hadn't even been 14 days.,1
Easiest music app ive used. Been using it for ten years.,5
wth.. 2 ads was tolerable but 5??,1
I only got to listen one day. But I think it's pretty cool.,4
Always great music!,5
"Spotify stream good less data consumption fast and good taping ,one thing i dont like is the volume my devices it dosnt boost sounds good the way i want pls let the developer of this App still work on the sounf production thanks",5
Not even going to lie I've been a hardcore Spotify listener for going on 3-4 years now and I never took the time to do a review. But check it out I recommend Spotify to anybody who likes music more than most of the people that surround them. I would vouch for Spotify to anybody on this Earth and before God admit that I have been blessed with playlists that hit the spot. Spotify something I've taken for granted a lot of times. 100% download Spotify right now!!!!,5
Doesn't display what song I'm playing on my phone anymore..,1
"Loving it. Keep me going all day. Great app, music for all ages.",5
I consider my musical taste as extremely eclectic. Spotify allows me to indulge in my eclecticism. For you to appreciate what I mean check out my playlist ECLECTIC IMAGES on Spotify.,5
Nice audio experience and with lyrics it's amazing. But you're showing too much of ads which makes it irritating to use. Showing ads are ok but you are showing it frequently. This will make the users to pissed off including me. Solve this ads issue in the next update. Three stars are fair enough to give according to me.,3
Very nice app once you have premium (only $10)Easy to use and always has the newest music.,5
Great content but adds are becoming annoying and app is very unstable and crashes constantly.....,2
I enjoy Spotify for it's ease of use.,5
"Love this app & the team behind it. Once I had a problem on my PC: Arch Linux, Gnome desktop environment and they managed to fix it within a single day! Nothing I would expect from such a big company.",5
"On my s20 fe , the app loves to disengage activity on bluetooth with my ford sync making me have to end the app through settings with force stop. Music will play and become unchangeable in the app or from my car as well as when I disconnect (getting out of my truck) it will endlessly play on the phone until I do so. I used to love the feature of it having a widget on my lock screen and my drop down menu but for some reason it doesn't exist anymore, at least on my phone. Idk, been here since 2016",3
All good. It would be great if there was an overall function to have everything in 8D once headphones are plugged in. Like a GENERAL FEATURE.,4
"Everything is great, except one major issue, the recomended for this list... list, is mainly the exact version of the songs i have in my list, this is really my only problem",4
"Terrible to use lately, lags horribly, makes it pain to even use.",1
"The app keeps adding non selected music into my liked songs list, that I have not idea that such songs existed 😠.",2
Love that I can listen to music with no advert,5
Where the hell has the queue button gone?! Please bring this back,1
never in all my years of living have i seen an app this bad its a waste of time it didnt let me play the 1 song i wanted i didnt have a playlist but it played random songs i didnt even know existed and then when i try removing it it doesn't let me and when its gone and i try playing it again it plays a random song this app is the worst i have ever seen,1
"Fantastic so far, one of my favourite apps!",5
Awesome but REDUCE THE ADS,5
"What a buggy disappointment! First, it said premium has no ads and that is wrong. I subbed for the 30 day premium promo and there are most definitely ads during Rogan's podcast that I have FF to get through. Secondly, this app is so buggy! 2 times now the video stops playing and clearing cache don't work. First time I had to uninstall and reinstall and video just went out for a second time just now. So looks like round two of uninstalling and reinstalling now! Thankfully it's a free trial.",2
Good music at all time,4
Sometimes the song I want is preempted by another song.,5
I love this app. i can listen to whatever kind of music i want and i love that kind of freedom.,5
Amazing!I've got my favorite songs old and new from A-Z completed. Thanks Spotify,5
"App has become a bloatware pos. Too many ads, too frequently, and too LONG. Not paying for this joke just to avoid your spam, and the spam has become the app. Updated: it has only gotten worse in the past year. By my estimate 1/3 of the time the app is 'playing' is now ads. Absolutely not worth wasting time on.",1
"I listen to spotify when I'm doing homework, on my way to work in my truck, on my spot spa sound machine at work. I am always tuned in. My son @JWatt is on spotify!",5
"awesome app, love the podcasts!",5
"Best music app, better than apple music which I had before",5
:( Bug that won't let me add any new personalized playlist photos. Says I should check my wifi connection. (which works perfectly fine.),5
Can the search be quicker? Maybe priorities musician then song title then lyrics last? Thank you for the service! May the Father of Heaven give you hope and a love and a knowledge of God. May you know the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to be faithful.,3
"An amazing music platform, makes it easy to find new music, share music with my friends, and there are even a ton of optional social features that really make Spotify special. I only wish you could pin more playlists",5
"Was five stars, but only recently I see that I simply cannot just open local audio files without Spotify opening then up. Have changed the slider in settings and it still happens. If I don't get an answer to this to resolve the way it was, I am unsubscribing.",1
Best music streaming,5
"dont download, stupid app, says Im losing followers on my artist profile when I know for a fact due to my self promotions and screenshots from facebook I have been gaining followers, adds songs you didnt want to your playlist, and the list goes on and on, what are you upto spotify, you earning so much money that you dont care about your users experience, your going to find your going to lose alot of subscribers due to your subpar platform, stupid app",1
"Since the last update, my Spotify is very slow to non responsive.. I get a black screen that takes about 3 minutes then gives me a time out message..",1
"Wish there was a cheaper option.$9.99 a month just to be able to skip more, replay, and skip backwards is ridiculous.",4
Excellent variety of music and information. Recommendations for music are spot on!,5
I guess good for everyone who likes to listen to music offline mode but.. other than that is pretty good 9.5/10.,4
Is good for music not to meny adds,5
"This is bad, u can only get 6 skips per hour? And sometimes it doesn't even play ur list music like war the heck man! This is a horrible app",1
I dont like your playlists and have turned off. Either play what I request or I will get my music elsewhere.,1
Its realy nice but my one problem is that you can't put the same song more than 1 time on a playlist.,4
All the music I love for free with the odd commercial- how can one complain!,5
"Keeps losing the ability to pause, the menu just disappears untill I restart my phone.",3
I love this app but it pos the song wuns in a Wiyll. Sorry ubawt my words. I am a kid.😑😑😑😶😶,4
I have this app in my phone. But after 1 mo. it stopped in my car. Saying it is free + built in my $800. phone why does it say I need to pay $10. a month. Confused!!,5
"Spotify is my main means of listening to music, which makes it rather annoying that the app keeps randomly crashing either a few seconds after starting it or even in the middle of songs. Not a great user experience right now!",3
The app isn't that bad however to access to cancel a subscription is a process when on a Android device.,3
This is probably the best app to listen to music,5
Best music app i have downloaded ever..I am surprised why I didn't get it before 🤦,5
Find almost every song I want.,5
"So , you want everyone to be a premium user . Ads after every w songs sometimes 1 song , i quit it",1
Unable to play podcasts. When played app closes instantly.,1
I love Spotify great music and podcast.,5
Cost a lot but the service is very good.,5
"No adds and able to listen to complete albums,concerts particularly.",4
"AMAZING!!! Where else can you get unlimited downloads and no commercials for $9.99?? I have nearly 500 songs on my Playlist. Who needs a radio, mp3 or CDs with an applied this. Been using it for years no and will never stop.",5
I can play a Playlist on my car with Bluetooth. Works great.,5
"Since the last update the app has not worked, I go to my liked songs and it says try again and anytime I go to a Playlist it says this Playlist is empty. It won't play any songs. Before the update it was working ok aside from it pausing for no reason.",1
"Provides a well of options, free and easy to use...i mean... What else can you ask for",5
"Spotify is better than Amazon Prime. It has a large amount of options from music, podcasts, and books. There are very few searches I have made that came up empty. It is less expensive than Amazon Prime with more to give.",5
"Great app, amazing variety of songs and podcasts, only bad thing is a few to many adds even with premium",5
It always glitches out and then says nothing playing even though something is playing and then the only way to get it back is to update the app.,4
I love how even if your phone is off you can still listen to your playlist ect if I could give this 100 stars I would!,5
Music is skipping so bad. I've had Spotify for over 10 years and I can't even get through a song without it skipping over 20 times. I am so frustrated. I think I am going to have to cancel. I don't know what else to do.,1
"When you pay for premium service and spend months curating playlists just for them to randomly disappear. Much great, such wow..",1
"Way too many ads. ""Listen to this ad for 30 min uninterrupted music"" but it's a lie 🥲",2
It's really good I've got premium but I need to use the genre feature in the liked songs. My genre sorting feature does not work for Android Google Pixel and I would like it to be fixed please and thank you thanks,1
Love it works great in my car.,5
Excellent music recommendations,5
"Only 6 skips per hour, it shuffles every playlist you listen to, as every 1-2 song, expensive subscription, cant listen to something in repeat. This is my experience in the first 20 minutes of spotify. In PC or PS4 all of these are different in a better way (excluding subscription cost). Aren't spotify ashamed?",1
Not even YouTube has 5 ads in a row,3
This App is Trash I listen to Music every day and it says Something went wrong and it keeps saying that this App is Trash don't use this app also it doesn't have any songs from Soundcloud also if I have Two accounts they both don't work,1
Its been a superb experience thus far. Easy to use. The ads definitely manageable. Overall 5 star rating.,5
Always great .... been with them from the start.,5
Notification bar glitches.,5
"I love the app but there's alot more music that could be out on there, like ""ballout"" by (juice wrld) lol but yeah all in all the app is great",4
"Bad at sticking to a soundtrack, keeps splicing other music in or just going off on tangents. Interface is to simplified, can't tell if I've got a setting wrong, but it should be the most straightforward thing to play the songs contained within a single soundtrack so there shouldn't be room for user error here.",1
Yo Spotify explain to me why every time I play the JRE podcast the app closes. But if I play anything else never happens. I will change my three stars back to five stars if someone can explain this. Yes I have uninstalled and reinstalled updated restarted my phone the whole nine yards.,3
Used this since 2017 and it gets used every single day Live the podcasts and the ability to just go anywhere Premium is deffinetly worth the price based on useage,5
My Downloads disappear after I re-open the app and downloads again,3
"I can't change the audio quality, eventhough i purchased premium please help out on this",1
This app is great until it starts constantly skipping songs on it's own every 15-30 seconds. Then it is wildly frustrating.,3
I love Spotify. I can stream all of foreign language classes.,5
Nice all the music I like to hear non stop,5
Too many ads. When connected to Bluetooth 4 to 5 ads play after 1 or 3 songs. The only way to listen is a paid subscription. It's getting to the point that I rather listen to the radio.,1
I miss when they used to let you play the song before adding it to a playlist :\,3
it was good for a while but now I cant turn off shuffle play so kys,1
Great experience and enjoying every minute of listening.,5
Smart and easy to use 😉,5
Love this app for all my music!,5
Love it always playing my jams every morning when I awake thank you spotify,5
Cant stop app without restarting my android phone. Need an easier option.,3
"Terrible sound quality, noticably worse than any other streaming service I've used. I just switched over to the premium service from Amazon Music and this is a HUGE drop-off in sound quality, songs regularly skip and stutter even with a high quality Internet connection. I'm shocked at how poor the sound quality is, and I'm baffled by why this is a popular app.",1
You can remember the songs from the lyrics that are written. Such a great app of songs.,5
I love Spotify! 😍 It's the only one I use.,5
Spotify is very easy to use It's one of the best music apps out their if not best.,5
Great variety of music and Podcast.,5
It's either my phone is slow but it's always a drag to change from one album to the next meaning the search engin is slow.. otherwise I'm happy!,3
Nice choice of music.,4
This app is a disaster now. Constant crashes and bugs. It will refuse to play downloaded tracks while offline. Or even bring up track listings. I don't know what I pay so much for this service for when it just seems to get worse with each passing month.,1
There are others out there but I always go back to Spotify.,5
It's better than a car radio.,5
best music streaming app in history,5
"Not happy, I can't play my music my way, unless I purchase your pay app.",1
I love your stories I'm literally addicted to them... It brings me back to my childhood when I use to watch Are You Afraid of the Dark and when I use to read Goosebumps book. I appreciate this podcast ❤️,5
"I am updating from 3 years ago. In the last week I have lost my entire library which consisted of $4,000 songs. I just removed the app and put it in again and still no library. The first page is there with recent plays and podcasts, etc. What is going on? I see a lot of not so good reviews when Spotify used to have wonderful reviews. I sometimes use Bluetooth and there's no library for me to play. Fix this bug.",2
"Great app, best in business. The layout and looks are fresh and modern. Loving it",5
Horrible app after the newest update would not recommend!!! Downloading a different app and deleting Spotify immediately!!,1
I find nothing wrong with the app except that it does not tell me when there are updates,5
Loved the app before I started to get ads. I can't skip to the next song until the current song is over because a screen saying the feature is premium. I'd rather get an ad than wait. And now I can't even select a SPECIFIC song from a playlist until I play that playlist and wait for the song I want to play. It's ridiculous how after your money this app is. PC version is better so far.,3
Plays Commercials but then don't play music on my tablet. Iv removed n reinstalled still same.. Update now don't play on my tone.. good by spotify,1
Great station I love this app you can choose your own music and play all day long,5
It was awesome ver good for music,5
should remove the ads,5
Sometimes dubbed songs have the lyrics of the original language's Translate isn't very accurate,5
"Video randomly stops working. ""Playback failed"" message constantly. Work out your bugs so i can enjoy my podcasts and i will rate this app higher.",4
Good app but too many ads,4
By far the best app for listening to music and podcasts. I just LOVE it... Really easy to use it‘s unlimited features.,5
"Decent selection of music, but borderline unusable due to frequency of ads that are SIGNIFICANTLY louder than the music. No one needs that jarring experience.",2
One of the best music player but I don't like the sound quality,5
App continuosly quits and and malfunctions. I used to recommend it to everyone. Now I have decided to stop using the app because of its issues.,1
"Exceptional app, I really enjoy it because is easy to use.",5
Easy listening with all of the Artists you can think. Search for an no matter how far back and you are there with the Artist.,5
It is a great app. I just recommend that if you are listening to songs that if you hear ads playing restart the app then you don't get ads. Have a good rest of your day.😀,5
"I like the app but I has many bugs, these days there is a new bug that doesn't show me online and I can't download any songs Or play any song that I haven't downloaded. It's getting very annoying because it's the fourth straight day of that problem.",1
"Lovely music app to use. It constantly gives me fresh music to listen to based on my likes, unlike apple music which keep playing the same Ole music that I constantly skip and suggestng music that I disliked. Thumbs-up to spotify.",5
good collection of song but there are a lot of ads. Please remove ads.,3
Basically every song ever made 😂,5
Time has come to uninstall Spotify like Jiosaavan because of ads.,1
It automatically stops the songs without any problem I have go again to app to play songs that frustrates to use this app it's easy to use Jio savanna instead of it,1
Well actually I have becomed my self as a premium user and now I can enjoy it.,5
I'm very happy with the app nd appreciate it ❤️,5
"This app is trash now, crashes constantly",1
"I'm one of the seven people who actually listens to the daily mix feature, and I like it because it's a good blend of songs and allows me to discover new music. However, over the past few months that feature has gone to garbage. There's no variety anymore, because it plays the EXACT same songs every single day. This feature is boring now. I have to resort now to enhancing my playlists, but it's really not the same. The rest of the app is great, but can you please fix this issue?",3
"Used to be good, since the UI chamges it sucks.",2
Not really a fan of the app constantly trying to run and play songs without my permission. Im on the samsung s20 and the app will just open up and start doing its thing randomly. Yeah no thanks,1
"I want to stop the default shuffle on EVERY playlist EVERY time. UGH, UGH, UGH Also why is it so hard to clear the queue? Do it one at a time? Here's an idea, listen to your customers.",1
"Hello Spotify, why have songs not been available anymore?? Its kinda your purpose to let people listen music. It makes me feel like i couldve just downloaded the songs one by one to my phone instead of paying Spotify for convenience and fun",2
I love all the songs and the app is surprisingly fast on my 6 year old phone. And it rickrolled me!,5
Nice to listen to music. And you can follow your friends,5
It's great but could use more playlist must not always be shullfed,5
"I've been a Premium subscriber for years. I love Spotify and have had minimal complaints in this time. The recent update to the app is a huge disappointment. It constantly crashes, skips songs or goes back to the beginning of the song. Please address this quickly! I want to go back to my 5 star app review and not cancel my subscription since I have years of liked songs and playlists saved.",2
Good apps in music!,5
"Decent. The algorithms for making daily mixes can be super repetitive, even when you try to like or move liked songs into your own playlist. There really should be a dislike button instead of a ""hide song from the playlist "" function because that song will later show up in another playlist. User interface is nice and easy to use.",2
"Since the May 16th update, have not been able to play any music on my phone. Re installed and all my playlist are gone. Can't even search for a song, it won't play. Very upset. And her we are again with another update that did NOTHING to fix the issue. Update a month later and still not able to play any playlist. Goodbye spotify, thanks for that lovely update that took everything away.",1
I'm very happy with Spotify. Doesn't take a lot of data storage.,5
It's ok but the ads every 30 min without premium kind of suck and should be moved to every 40 to an hour but other than that it's very good,4
ads are annoying ... a lot,3
This music app use to be better. The random song play function plays the same songs over and over. Bring the old Spotify back!!,2
It was good but there was a lot of ads.this had a lot of songs which I really enjoyed and the ads were coming like more than one ad.,4
I love this app because it has lyrics 👍,5
It's amazing music platform I love it so much,5
"Spotify is a great music app for finding newly released music to add to your library. What a fantastic selection, good vibes from Spotify. ❤😊😉✌",5
i hate how many times i have update it. like I JUST WANNA LISTEN TO MUSICCCCCC,2
"It's good, but I think they should add offline music",5
You can only skip 3 songs ever hour,4
Great service I always enjoy it can pick out exactly what I want to listen to you should get it,5
Much improved over the last 2 yrs. Very good app.,5
"Recent updates have made the list of liked songs to disappear. New songs can't be visibly added to the list. If I go under an individual song I can see that it is liked, yet no songs appear in the playlist. It is possible to activate the list through Google Assistant. Sometimes when you press play on a podcast, nothing happens, and then you ha e to restart the app to get it to work. Edit: pressing play on a new podcast no longer works at all.",5
Perfect app vert less ads,5
"I love being able to make my own Playlists and listen to my favorite music. Amazing ui interface, and easy to navigate with a plethora of options.",5
I love Spotify they play anything I want to listen 3,5
Great UI and good Playlists,5
If you have premium this app is so cool and you can find most songs in good quality. It also recommends a lot of really good songs for me!,5
"Absolute buggy mess. Not only does it pause whatever I'm listening to every few minutes, the play button is straight up broken. It plays when you press it, but it's impossible to pause, let alone scrub through the song or podcast. No amount of reinstalling the app or restarting my phone has been able to fix this. The exclusive content isn't worth the headache.",1
Wonderful & Easily accessible. All songs are available in one place.,5
Love my Spotify music!,5
Great app and friendly user,5
Simply amazing simply amazing best app ever,5
It is so much better than SoundCloud. I just wish the 3rd party DJ controller functions were back.,5
I love Spotify. I use it all the time,5
The update sucks now instead of 3 song then 4 ads now is 4ads in every song it's terrible app wasted lost happy moments then ad pops out ruining I freak out scare me every time ene worse if the app nonfiction YOU CAN'T SEND FEEDBACK BECAUSE THEY BLOCKED IT REFUSE TO SEND FEED BACK!!!!!,1
Fastest service deliverer site,5
I can't able to buy premium membership for all plan it show sorry you're no eligible for this plan please solve this problem,5
it was good until the shuffle button was replaced with a pause button with the option to shuffle the playlist. Now I have to find songs instead of just pressing the shuffle button,3
Love where I can go listen to any of the 70s & 80s rock whenever I want!,5
The older version are more user friendly,2
"I am trying to login to my account with my phone number but it is taking ages to get the ""vacation code or something"" and am unable to login [and the ads are annoying]",1
"There usually some type of issue going on. Restarting the app, and restarting the phone, doesn't always work. Maybe it's just me but I've had better luck with other apps with their algorithm for recommending me bands/songs.",3
I hate advertise please revome advertise from this app😡,1
Brilliant I have music all day. Either through the TV or earphones wouldn't be without it,5
"Hello. Im experiencing an issue where when I play any songs, it will only play for a few seconds and then pause. Afterwards the apps will freeze and im unable to load any playlist afterwards. Music has been helping me to stay focus while studying, such a bummer this issue happend when exam week are around the corner. Please fix this bug. Thank you.",2
"I find it unfair that in my iPad and PC you can loop and skip songs wtv you want, but then my phone that is an Android can't just because I don't have premium?",3
Brilliant for a 73 year old geezer good old 60 music,5
"Honestly it is a nice app but why is it always adding songs to my playlists this ""we added"" is so annoying idc what you added I only want to listen to my songs and not your stupid adds also it just autoplays these added songs althought I turned it off. If this won't go away I'll just switch back to youtube music/youtube because even youtube only have double ads and you have 3 ads in a row.",3
I love it. All the bands I love in one place. Endless possibilities,5
Love it my nephew set up songs that my brother loved. Many memories,5
I love Spotify. You can listen to any music(song) you want!!! I love it ❤️❤️❤️🎶✨,1
I hate it now that you updated it in a negative way now I can't even play any song I want to cause it only allows me to play with premium or I'll have to wait 6hours to play another song So plz can you just put it back to normal To wher you can play as many song as you want.,1
"I am a paying customer have been for a bit... over the last month, are crazy amount of song will not play anymore... either zero sound or will just not play.. thinking maybe it was the device I signed into a different device and sure enough same issue... it's quiet disappointing.. the app is updated. I have uninstalled and reinstalled..... and still... doesn't work.. can this be looked into... seeing as I drive for my job.. it would be nice to have this issue resolved.",3
"The app was good for the past 4 days but when i opened the app and try to play my fav songs,i started to wonder why it isn't playing the full song but now i i know...I had to play the shuffle songs which is kinda annoying since i only get 6 skips 👎🏻...This app really is RESTRICTING.",2
"Hmm, so much ads, and if you are thinking you would make me buy your premium then forget about it, 😂😂",1
My Son Introduced Me To Spotify Not Really Interested Until I Downloaded The App. I Do Not Understand How I Did Not Try The App Earlier. I Love You ✌🖤😘.,5
Best audio quality,4
Great app. Love the music and podcasts.,5
Whenever I connect my phone with Wi-Fi the app shows that it has no internet connection,3
THE BEST MUSIC APP EVER! I WOULD GIVE IT INFINITE STARS!!!!,5
Keeping shutting down since changed from S21 to S22. Plays for a while then stops,3
I have been with Spotify since they begin I enjoy the music selection I enjoy the idea if I can't afford the membership at least I still got a way of listening to the music,5
"I use this almost 100% for podcasts, even a podcast playlist which is awesome. Searching podcasts buy title or subject or topic and making customized playlists is a great feature.I do appreciate that your downloads don't take how much room and then I can use the Spotify all the time even when I'm offline. Also when I got a new phone it loaded my Spotify favorites history everything perfectly, thanks",5
"The only issue I have is that you gotta have data to play music, other than that it's really cool",5
I loved it but now the songs get gritchy and laggy when my screen shuts off. I have premium and my songs are downloaded. This never happened before.. starting to be very unpleasant.,3
Great app and all but when I play music after it's done an advertisement pops up and after then says enjoy your 30mins of no ads ... Five mins later an ad pops up and after it's done it says the same,4
"Guys. I've been using Spotify from so many years. After updating to Android 12 with oxygen OS 12 on OnePlus 8t, the audio quality is very poor. I was listening to a post malone song before I hit restart for updating to Android 12 and after fishing the update I went back to Spotify and played the same song and it was distorting and the quality was so bad. I've tried other apps too like apple music and tidal and they don't have this issue. Please fix this or else I won't buy yearly premium again.",1
"Very nice app but it need more song's of k-pop teams and need to remove ads ""For one's is new in this app It is a nice app",5
Very good app. But i pay for Spotify premium and podcasts tend to run their own ads on the show. Spotify need to find a way of stopping that for premium users. Or cutting it out of our podcasts.,3
Good selections. Just wish there was a way to block artists you don't like.. There is a down side it stops playing after about 3 tracks and I don't know why..,3
"Was amazing until my phone updated. Now it doesn't do anything on mobile at all. My liked tracks just shows ""something went wrong try again"", my daily mixes and playlists are empty, search results never even show up....this is the only app that doesn't work on my phone since the update, please fix it. I don't really wanna go back to pandora. Galaxy a10e",1
Spotify keeps crashing in Vivo x80 phone after updating the app. Not able to play any song,3
Too many adds... ridiculous,1
A stupid app I can't even play songs,1
#NAME?,2
This is really a good app for listening several types of songs. I like this app.,5
Its best app for music I used to listen old song of india,5
"enjoying the experience, but isn't there any way we could enjoy atleast few offline songs.. nigeria le o, data dey finish sometimes.. i don't want your premium",5
Not very good there are so many interuptions in listening,3
I love this app. The only problem is there no way to download songs. The whole reason I wanted a music is to listen on the road if going on long trip. But i cant listen offline. And i am not going $120 a year to listen offline! Plz fix this. This app is my favorite to navigate. Plz read this.,3
Edit: 06/22 any podcast with video crashes the app repeatedly. Going to cancel because this is not premium service at all. Great app when premium but latest update is freezing the app when coming back into it from background on android. Can we also bring back search in playlist to the top of the playlist? Having to go through a menu to search is less convenient.,3
Very fast and amazing,5
Best music streaming platform . Hands down,5
IIII HATE THIS APP PLEASE CLOSE THISS RIGHT NOW I CAN'T SKIP OR NEXT THE SONG AND SO MANY FREAKING ADS I HATE THIS APP 😡🤬🤬😡👍,1
Best app for listening music we can find any song on this great app I use only this app,5
"Notifications are not dismissed when the app is closed on Android 12. When you close the app, the static notification that allows you to navigate your current album/playlist should be dismissed. This prevents accidentally starting music via the notification, which can be VERY annoying and disruptive. And no, I shouldn't have to manually dismiss the notification every time I close Spotify. When I close an app, it should be obvious that I don't want to use that app anymore.",1
What the hell happened to Spotify? With the new update you can't even play a playlist. It plays in a random order. You click on a song in the playlist it plays a preview from a random spot in the song. What the hell is this apple music? And listening to music on here is like Pandora now. It plays stations instead of the actual song. You can't even rewind anymore. What the hell spotify?!,1
"One of the best apps on my phone, so easy to use and garante has something for everyone to enjoy. I simply love spotify ♥️",5
"Great music App and sharing platform. Menus/ choices are a not intuitively placed requiring you to explore but, works well.",5
"Music is great, but Spotify keeps asking for Bluetooth access which I already gave and now the play button moved to the left which is an odd choice. Maybe a bug?",4
Awesome performers and what a beautiful sound,5
So many ads during songs,3
"Very convenient and fast 👌💯 enjoyable 😩😊,got All the necessary music ,less complicated and does not shut down fast",5
Great easy to listen to music and so much choice 👌,5
Every thing went 😎 awesome for the first few weeks but now my dongs dant play 8 they play the app closes,5
"Sometimes if you follow a link pn Facebook, it denies you from play the song and other stuff",1
"Finally a product that is as advertised, even the free version is as promised, thanks guys.",5
I'm a platinum user and I can't believe how much is available for me to explore,5
I would give it five stars but the sound is a little off otherwise great selection of music and podcast!,4
"I like spotify but I HATE that on phone version doesnt really let u skip song that u dont like, I mean u need premium and its super annoying.",2
Good but ads are problem,5
Very good and needs improvement. It is not that user friendly !,4
"Great idea for music playlists and songs, but I listen to more ads then music. I play 1 song and then get 7 ads back to back that are 30 seconds a piece.",2
Not able to buy premium through the app or browser.,1
"One of the best music streaming apps but the only problem is that it stops playing music after a couple of minutes, then I have to open the app again",4
Bro it's about commercials So many commercials More than YouTube and very long commercials It's make me piss me off,2
This is because Spotify keeps forcefully adding songs to my playlist that I don't want and limits my skips to 6 even though I don't want those songs . Please remove your recommendations as they aren't needed. Thank you,1
"Today, one of my family members on premium family which was already in use, stopped working. Whe i logged in, that family member was gone from the list of members. Now i cant add any new mebers either. The link does not work. Also, i cannot log a support request, there are only pre-defined problems listed, which does not have my problem listed. I cannot get my problem resolved, so i will cancel my subscription tomorrow.",1
Yeah it's fine when it works properly shame that's a rare occasion,1
It won't support mobile payment. even there is enough balance + taxes needed,3
Simply outstanding collection of song,5
I rate this a 1 because I want to listen to the music even after I'm on another site but what it does is it plays for a little bit and then automatically stops and the tab in the notification bar disappears it has not happened once but multiple times!!,1
"For the free spotify, theres lack of abilities. I mean at least when we make playlist play the songs thats are IN the playlist and not suggested.",2
It's nice but I can't download any songs or playlist made by me own. Please look at this problem,3
"uhm, yes. affordable price of premium.",4
Nice Music Quality.. but add is very Long..,5
Good diversity of likable music,5
Best music app .love it,5
This is an nice app for taking musices fun (and happyness).,5
This app is the best app to listen music 🎶 But we cant listen music ofline This is a very bad fault .we need to pay to listen songs ofline.,3
Useless waste of money. I downloaded this app specifically for podcasts and the obvious bias throughout the company made sure I won't be using this company again. There are major issues with programs from a specific side of the spectrum and it's becoming more and more obvious. If you're a bigot then this is the app for you,1
It is best app to hear music.,5
"Because of so many advertisement I am uninstall this application, worst app . You are loosing number of users because of stupid advertisement. Should think about it .",1
"Spotify pls help me!!! I logged out of my acc so when I tried to log in again I realised that I forgot my password, after trying I clicked join without psw and since I wasn't getting any link to my email I kept or redoing it, now it says ""too many attempt try again later"" what shud I do?!! How shud I reset it?! Spotify pls tell me what I shud do",4
"Best that has happened to me, now I can go anywhere and have my favorite songs🖒",5
Top class experience not minding the advertisement,5
Why did you guys remove the song preview when making a playlist?,4
"Used it for years, great app with everything you need.",5
"Good music but too much advertising (30 sec)every after a song, and a bad laoding.",2
Hi 👋 this app Spotify is very nice 👍🏻 But some few problems are there 😳 Other wise this app is amazing like There sound quality etc 🤩 thank you very much ☺️ you must install this app Spotify 😀😯 BYE 🙏🌈💜🌈💜,4
Its pretty good I have the student plan and it's not bad it's like premium it has outstanding performance but it lags about but I think it's my phone not 100 percent sure but yea,4
Wonderful when it's working hate it when i have to actually use the appon the phone,3
"I've been using a 6GB RAM phone. But sometime Spotify takes a lot of time to load a song. I update the app as soon as I see update notification. I'm a premium user. I love Spotify, It's my only source of music. It's an amazing app. But if just Spotify resolve this issue, it would be 5 stars.",4
It is a very amazing app wich makes it possible to listen to all of your favorite songs with out having problems,5
I have been using many music aps in the past 10 years or so... I find Spotify the best one in terms of functanality and ease of use... Still few improvements required like usage in poor network areas... Need to fix that,5
This app is really amazing to listening a song 😃,4
"Terribly optimised for android. The music skips randomly, the now playing bar dissapears, and playlists randomly undowload themselves",2
Add skips and play song automatic,4
I can't play the song like before and it's playing shuffle when I don't want to shuffle....it's happening from yesterday night please make this correct because I can't able to hear songs....I've sent you an email still this is not fixing .... so fix this issue please,1
Love it all just not the ads,5
It keeps playing suggested songs even when i turned it off this app is so bad,1
Unbelievable but super I like very much I impressed thanks lot,4
The app is just perfect.,5
"Used to be incredible, but the so called enhancements have made it almost unusable. Playback suddenly stops without warning, the app crashes repeatedly and its now impossible to refresh playing from liked songs or playlists. I really hope this gets fixed otherwise I'll have to look at alternatives.",1
"As a music app definitely serves its purpose, great algorithm on preference and I love the offline play. Main reason I subscribe, you get a discount if you pay for full year which most music apps don't offer. Only draw back, doesn't offer details on tracks eg production date, producers, and also no mixed content",4
"Please, how do I turn the shuffle off? Is annoying. I don't need the shuffle thing",3
It's too complicated to understand,2
High quality songs and lyrics,5
Ita good but the ads are annoying and long,4
I was going to give you 5 Stars but In Spotify it would play one song and then starts playing like 3 to 5 Ads that are 30secs each and then it won't play the song that was going to play pls fix that.,4
Kindly remove shuffle option from my Spotify I hate it very bad,5
"Needs more sorting options. So easy to add, why not?",4
-1 star due to excessive number of ads,4
"Ads every 5 minutes, just like old school Doordarshan. 😂 So I finally paid for Premium. It has the best collection of songs across many applications I've used.",5
"Very good music app, I recommend to everyone who enjoys good music",5
It's a great app but I don't like how u add songs to playlists and sometimes I don't like the songs so that's why I gave 4 stars but apart from that it's an amazing app with different types of songs!,4
Got the new update and now the app is trash. Never works right. Just freezes up and it's a waste of money. Would like a refund for my subscription,1
love this app totally but the ads r just so weird n irritating,5
"Personally, the latest update is one of the strangest updates ever in history of bad updates ever in companies. How are you gonna force non-premium users to use shuffle all the time? That's stupid. I don't want to have to listen to multiple other songs that don't even go with the song I'm trying to play. they ruined playlists with this update. c o p o r a t e g r e e d",2
Having trouble finding a couple of albums otherwise great how do you like my playlist,4
There does not need to be an ad after every 3 songs ok. Also only 6 skips per hour is annoying,3
Super good music and really easy to figure out if u just started to use it is recommend,5
Best app for songs,5
"Premium user. Every update the bugs get worse and worse. I know bugs are bound to happen but now the app crashes constantly. The sleep timer on podcasts is broken and will not aways work. As in I have set the sleep timer set and I wake up with a podcast playing. It's an amazing app when it works well but I can't go a day after this update without a frustrating bug. The last updates yielded bugs once a week, what did you guys do with the last update that makes the app terrible?",3
I don't want they added song and extra song in my fav songs and actually in my playlist they so many added and i have 2 song in that playlist I love the songs but when i press the song will be other bc of ur added i wish spotify see this and remove that and pls if i play the song will play until the end of the song not u just press and song a bit and done,2
I love Spotify!! I feel like it's very diverse with its music but sometimes the ads just get a annoying sometimes,4
"It frequently crashes, they don't want you to listen, but only subscribe with payment. Annoying popups and adverts. They pay artists almost nothing. And they invest in the terminators that will one day kill us all.",1
Solid app. Only thing is the shuffle play on all liked songs tends to stay on the same 100. You can fix that by letting it play overnight on linear (alphabetical) so it stops picking up on your listening patterns and fav songs. Other than that I'm happy. Had it for around 5-6 years now,4
I use this app evey day the only downside is the ads,5
Adverts a lot less intrusive than other platforms,5
"Needs to give you an option to ditch podcasts - or any content someone might not be interested in. I don't need a good portion of the app showing me things I'll never use. I also find navigation more difficult than necessary. Digging into an artist, album, genre, easily finding last played songs, all opaque and cumbersome to accomplish.",3
the app is amazing but m i not getting the lyrics in my app..updated it a several times !!!,3
"No advert, easy to find a song",5
"Even after upgrading to premium, I'm unable to use Canvas feature... There's no such option as ""Canvas"" in the setting. Please solve this issue, one of my friend is also facing the same in Android version. Feels like Spotify doesn't give a f about us and only taking care of iPhone users.",1
"There is no option to find the hidden songs. I am not talking about "" show unplayable songs "" option . There is no spesific location or an option to find the songs if you do not remember the playlist or the song ! Rather than that this is a very much entertaining app ❤️👌",4
After update not working why?,5
Sound quality is great...,5
"Love this app, easy to use, best for music",5
When I hear my favorite music it makes me calm Nice app,5
This app is a piece of junk the only thing it's good for is listening to songs on your Xbox One or computer literally it will play songs that aren't even in your playlist when you're on your phone it is literally like forcing you to get premium this app is trash on your phone but pretty good on every other platform.,2
Amazing music platform,5
Excellent app sound quality is very amazing 👍,5
Sometimes my music goes off and sometimes it doesn't give me the right song,4
"STOP ADDING SONGS TO MY PLAYLIST! I HATE IT! IF YOU STOP DOING THAT, ILL GIVE YPU 4 STARS! GOD.",1
"Let's be honest your advertisements are ridiculous as everyone knows, and that's fine to have 4 ads interrupting my day but is it also necessary to happen once I run out or skips...so surprise another 3 ads😑",2
"Ads-tify not spotify, ads after ads.",3
More ads than options. Keeps clinching so my podcasts close after a few minutes of playing,2
"This app sucks DO NOT DOWNLOAD, ALSO they have this thing where if u like a song and put it in liked songs it will play other songs and u can't do anything about it because it hides the songs in ur playlist.",1
"I hate the fact that when I am searching for a song, it comes out as a playlist. And the playlist is on compulsory shuffle! I end up not listening to my chosen song first/at all. It doesn't make sense at all. It inhibits my satisfaction 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️",3
There is to many ads and you can't play the specific song you want EVEN AFTER WE'RE FORCED TO WATCH ADS! if we're forced to watch an ad Spotify can play the song I search for or pay us to watch your ads #PayThePeople #BoycottSpotify,1
You guys ruined Spotify. Its awful and not what it used to be. So sad to see another American freedom taken away. Time to go back to pandora.,1
Luv their music selection I need vintage music works like a good marriage.,5
It's a good app if you want to listen to music and have 4 adds after every 2 songs,2
"Since this afternoon, my app no longer shows media controls, doesn't indicate the currently playing song and doesn't show in notifications or my android 12 lock screen. Although it worked fine this morning. Could there be a conflict with my Android Auto?😒🙄",3
"Awesome way to hear the music I want to hear. The app is simple to use, straight forward, and has a great variety of artist. I have yet to be disappointed.",5
Fresh music easy to access it fantastic thanks to the developer of this platform for great work he has provided,5
very good application... the quality and variety of music is spectacular.,5
The best music streaming services,5
Best country music this side of the moon!,5
Nice song play low net smoothly,5
"I have had this for years, I love it and I can't complain, good updates and everything meets my needs, love that it is free and the subscription is nicer, but love that there is a option",5
the new updates to the app have become increasingly frustrating to use,3
"I got 1 month premium, now when I create a playlist and add a song to the playlist through search feature app crashes and restarts on it's own and the new playlist gets deleted on it's own please fix it",1
Great music platform. Premium is most certainly worth it.,5
Spotify music is a good way to relax and enjoy good music from various Artist,5
Very easy and fun but ads come a bit too much,4
Very good collections.,5
If you want to enjoying the music so this app is best for you you can see all music of world in this app i like this app Thank you Spotify,5
A1 song app ever seen it it's like gajab amazing.......❤️❤️😍😍,5
Spotify has become my go-to music platform for a while now. Really appreciate the work that goes into this app. I got premium and spent 20k minutes last year listening to music on here 😅. I have one genuine feature request - blocking podcasts / removing them from suggestions on the home screen. Love you guys!,5
"App is good and i love the sound quality. One problem i faced is, i changed phone and everything went boom!!! Can't play my playlists, can't play the downloaded songs...app kept crashing...tried everything to get it back but it was hopeless. Last i deleted all my playlists, reinstall app and it works fine again!",5
Love this app so much I can chose any song I want,4
Amazing and super easy to use!!!!!!!!!,5
"Sometimes lags when out and about. And it's great way to accessing music, and creating Playlist like back in the day.",4
4 30 second ads for skipping one song? My 5 star just went to 2.,2
"App is updated, have restarted my phone, but keeps force closing. Please fix",1
I've only had this app for a little while but so far I really love it. I am able to hook up with my Bluetooth speaker and take it with me from room to room while I'm cleaning and it doesn't disturb my husband while he is watching T.V. I am not very good with technology and this app is very easy to use.,5
"For what it's worth, I love it. But you will never find another app that you get a month free premium for $9.99 unless we're talking about Pandora (looking at you). Spotify is awesome cos they have their own family plan and each playlist is always curated to you",4
"The app is good, the only problem I have is all the adds, and there are a few songs that I can't find on here, it's almost like they never existed, but so far I love all the songs I've found!",3
"I use it all the time, paid sub. It would be dope if ppl could comment on your playlist",5
Why even add the playlist feature if you arn't gonna play the songs I added? 💀💀,1
can you guys please add more skips and make it easier to replay songs like a replaying feature.,3
High quality s**t. Almost unlimited music (99.99% of all music in the known universe) Cheap af until you break your arm and can't pay a single bill. 6 out of 3 stars. 💯💯. Plz let me listen to music. My arm hurts.... Lol,5
"Exactly what I needed, awesome stuff.",5
Lot less ads than the other companies,5
Stop asking me to turn on Bluetooth and maybe I'll up this rating. I don't need a pop up every time I open an app I pay $10 a month for.,1
"After the most recent update, the widget on my slide down bar stops working after I've had it paused for a couple of minutes. I have to manually go back into the app itself and press play on the song.",3
"""Watch this commercial you'll get 30 minutes of uninterrupted play"". I DID watch the commercial! about 10 minutes later, ANOTHER commercial😳!!! I DIDN'T get 30 minutes of interrupted play.!!! What made my experience at Spotify unpleasant, song list with songs you wanted or not and when they add songs to my list it's usually people I never even heard of!!!🤬 I'm going to check out other music apps. I don't like playing my music and then hearing music I don't like that was chosen by Spotify!!! 😕",1
Superb selection of music and podcasts.,5
Excellent quality off sound and music genres.,5
STILL the best music app I have ever had!,5
"My god, if you are to use any version use the computer version, this will add random songs to your playlist, and give you limited skips so you can't go through them. The ads they also give you are so much more annoying, you cant even close the tab they open, and the only way to avoid these things is pay for premium Would not recommend to anyone, use the computer version if you really want spotify, this is a blatant cash grab.",2
Enchanting all music languages under one roof,5
You took away the ability to watch video podcasts on my TV. This is literally the reason I have a paid subscription.,2
Sometime network issue otherwise amazing,4
Cannot live without my Spotify!!!!,5
Great apps for music and podcast lovers for all generations! ❤️❤️❤️,5
"An amazing app! I used to get 1 to 2 ads before I got Premium, and I've had Premium for about 6 months. The trial ended and now I get 3-5 ads. All I want to do is listen to music without so many ads </3",4
Best app I have down loaded any Song I ask for I get. Awesome .,5
"Wish the shuffle options was better, but great overall.",4
Must include the option of voice search.,4
"The monthly paid service is brilliant! So many songs, I always find what I'm looking for.",5
I really enjoy the music variety.,4
Always has something good for me to listen to...,5
It's good I love it but when I add songs to a playlist it randomly adds some songs. If you could make that stop thanks but if you can't sorry for wasting your time.,4
"Wonky with sd card, no easy way to manage downloads or see how many songs you have downloaded, no good way to true shuffle through all your songs",3
"Spotify is not that great without the premium or paying real money for benefits. You can't pick a specific song you want to play and you cannot play a certain song over again. You can't even play a playlist in order. All you can do is shuffle a playlist and hope you hear the song you want. This is really dissapointing for a music app. I'm hoping to find a better one; and you all should too! If you really want to use Spotify, pay for premium because it is terrible without it.",1
I love the app. Been using it for many years,5
Easy and useful,5
Way too many ads compared to the amount of songs you listen. Good app apart from that though,3
Incredible app but the group sessions work better before when you could scan to connect.,4
"Buggy. Put a podcast into a playlist. Download pod. Play playlist. Remove pod from playlist and from downloads. Play playlist and the ""removed"" pod still plays. Also keeps saying there is no internet when every other app on my phone connects fine. I have regularly encountered this problem for years on 3 different phones.",2
I was stuck on pandora for a while but I am glad I switched love it,5
"I used to love this app because I could choose which songs that I wanted to listen to in my playlist. Now, I'm forced to listen to them all just to get to the song I want to hear. You have ruined this app Spotify, congratulations, now, I will never use this app again.",1
"Great app, just wish would allow a like or dislike on recommended songs so the same ones don't keep reappearing.",4
I already mentioned the incorrect names of some songs or the timing they are being played at..too fast or too slow but no one has made the proper corrections or even acknowledge my inputs,4
"Started using Spotify as a student at a discount and now done studying, still use everyday🥳 Spotify makes my morning routine so much better with great music and suggestions. Thank you Spotify 🥰",5
I love Spotify I recommend it to anyone,5
Way better then xm. And I can always deal with ads at a free price,5
I liked the songs tht r playing thts y i gave it a 4 nd not 5 bcuz it has 2 much ads which i dont like playin in between while i am listening 2 my favourite tunes,5
"Excellent app,no crashing and it will play our song from where we had stopped recently",5
Just amazing .prefect for every occasion,5
Trash always cuts out every couple of minutes been with them for years but will be cancelled shortly unless it's fixed asap.,1
We were on vacation with no TV and you saved the week.,5
Spotify is the best for podcasts & Music like when I work out. I use Spotify and I will never use any other music service,5
Spotify and only spotify for me!,5
the best way to listen to music. reccomends songs for me so i can find music i wouldnt have been able to find otherwise. also makes it extremely easy to share playlists with others,5
"Good, although whats with the downloaded playlists not working when youre offline, so whats the point in downloading them??",3
Some good old and not too old music. Nice blend of world music.,4
Spotify is a great music app. I've discovered a lot of really amazing artists on the platform. The reason why I'm giving it a 4 star is because I've been trying to subscribe to premium with my Samsung phone but I can't seem to select a payment method. Is there anywhere I can resolve this?,4
"Smooth, has what I want and doesn't cost too much. By far my favorite music app. However, it would be nice to join the rest of the world with Hifi quality. I have to pay for Tidal on the side to get the most out of my system.",5
I like it but it does not play the song on your liked songs even if you do shuffle,3
"The app keeps crashing, keeps stopping and pausing for no apparent reason. I have this app for one exclusive podcast, and the cost-benefit ratio between enjoyment and frustration is tipping very seriously in the wrong direction.",2
Well sometimes you want lyrics on every song it is not that way always,4
Great selection and great music.,5
"Spotify is a very good App, has archive of genre",5
Playlists are being rearranged at the speed of light- this is clearly a bug and reinstalling did not work to fix it,1
I dont want half an hour of ads for 1 song you are a joke and this is why people will continue to find ways around your joke of an app,1
Can find good music on here,5
Spotify is a great app you get to listen to your different songs it got a lot of songs around the world your favorite songs too get it 😍,5
Fantastic app I've never searched for a song that couldn't be found Spotify has everything I've ever looked for and then some love not having the commercials and a big library of songs never ending wonderful entertainment,5
"Music quality, volume normalization, playlists, and ease and versatility of streaming on different devices are all great. Group sessions could use work. Music recommendations aren't as advanced as Spotify wants you to think - nothing will top early-Pandora's Music Genome Project. Most spotify-built playlists are worded vaguely as to what they actually are, and podcasts are shoved in your face throughout the app. Finally, 'offline mode' is straight B.S. It requires an Internet connection.",4
Cool now that I can finally see the lyrics (I bought premium so I can't complain about anything),5
Doesn't work half the time and have to clear cache and force stop all the time,3
It's great if you have the premium subscription. Lyrics came back!!,5
"If I want to play a specific song, it plays the whole playlist, which i find extremely annoying and it only let's me skip six songs an hour, so I'm stuck with the same playlistof songs even though i wanted tailored songs",2
"Sometimes during search for new it takes so much time.,",4
Only app worth writing a review for. Almost perfect. Now provide a visualizer for Playstation and Xbox...please.,5
My all time favorite source of music. I've I've using Spotify since it came out and I'll never use anything else. 😊,5
Lyrics don't let you click them to skip to that part of the song. Only a problem on mobile. Also own uploads can't be synced across devices.,4
"I wish I could give it no star but you can't. The new update is stupid I can't skip songs the way I want .I can only skip 6 times in an hour 🤦🏿, Just bring back the old version.",1
Learning to love it! ❤,5
Its ok put up with the comershals and is good free,4
You can get your stars back when my I'm no longer logged out of my fitbit every 10 seconds,1
The BEST music app EVER!!!!,5
you dont have to pay to listen to music. also i cant listen to songs while offline and internet isnt always accessible,1
"Won't play the song I request, just keeps playing random music.",1
"Wonderful, ideology ads a bit much",5
"Deleted my old review and am replacing it with this one. Anyway. Want a consistent music app that works reliably? Look elsewhere. UI can't stay consistent and performance is always hit or miss. Don't know who, or what, group of people are running the show over at Spotify, but jesus christ, they need to go. Only reason I still use the app is because it has just about any genre and band I could ask for. If it weren't for that, I would have ditched it long ago.",1
Love the freedom of having any music I want any time I love Spotify thank you,5
Group session is not working properly,2
"I have had it for about two weeks now and it's good, so far. Listening to a lot of Phil Collins and DMX. Yes, I like both!",5
Have had Spotify for a few years now and I'm not going back to anything else.,5
I love Spotify everything you want and more,5
Absolute rubbish. It adds rubbish to your playlist and doesn't actually play any of your music.,1
Everything I need in a music app.,5
"3-4 ads after every 1 song, 2 songs if you're lucky. Songs spontaneously stop playing. Never thought I'd go back to Pandora, but I probably will. This app has become garbage.",1
"It's a great app!but can you please add,, 03 by SHMEKERA"" please it's my favorite song.",5
I enjoy using Spotify.,4
"For some reason, when I open Spotify it tells me that I'm offline, when I have wifi and my other apps are working, or if It does work, I don't hear any sound when songs play. please help me fix this!!",5
Premium is simply the best way to go. Affordable and being able to download your playlists are absolutely fantastic. Great quality of life if your service is spotty,5
"It was amazing a few weeks in, (unpaid) when I could play any song I wanted. A few later, still unpaid, I had no control. It shuffles my playlists, and I would've liked that since all my songs are good. It was an immediate uninstall when random 'recommended' songs appeared. Shuffling into a song I've never heard is unacceptable.",1
Music none stop all day everyday paying worth every dollar and coin.,5
Unbelievable what you get for free. My fav app,5
"I ABSOLUTLEY LOVED THIS, it had all my favorite sooongs, and I found ppl with my same interests in musiiiic- Spotify is my life man.",5
It's gotta be the best app that I've have ever used thus far. Thank you to all the people who make this station a reality. Sincerely. M.Foss,5
"Spotify has stopped playing on my mobile device and keeps telling me no internet connection, despite having a good internet service. I hope it is rectified as I am already losing interest in the app.",2
It is better on a PC or laptop than a mobile phone on mobile phone you can't skip more than 6 times per hour or listen to a specific song you searched if your gonna use it use it on a laptop,2
Very good App we listen every artist songs,4
This app is good to listen to music,4
Love it! Has all the music & podcasts I need,5
Great music selections in any genre.,5
it doesnt show full lyrics,5
Its a good app for misic so i do recomend for school and otger puppese.,5
I cannot click on the song I want to listen to. A few days ago it allowed me to now the only way I can listen is to play all and skip through which is odd. Please fix this issue,2
"Probably the best music app that exist. Me Personally, I think this is The Best Music App ever. My OPINION.~~",5
Love the app. The only thing that bothers me is the new playlist system that was implemented. I can't play the songs in my playlist without it being mixed up with other songs that weren't added to the playlist. Now I usually open Spotify on my laptop because it doesn't have the annoying feature.,4
"I love the app and just how free to be yourself it is, but I use premium because there were so many adds even during ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"". Also lately songs are being taken off for whatever reason",4
"If I tell it to play the music out of my watch, it instead just goes to the Bluetooth screen and won't let me play it. Fix this bug or this app is unusable",1
Garbage dont instal this waste of time and storage,1
"Excellent catalogue of music, in any genre thought of.",5
"Buggy and unreliable. E.g. sometimes I start Sonos music, return to the app not long after and it has no idea music is playing, so hard to stop it. A Sonos speaker that is always on the network sometimes appears in Spotify and sometimes does not (the Sonos app has no problem). Connecting to Sonos speakers is painfully slow. Often I open the app and tap one of the recently accessed items at the top of the home page and just as my finger touches it, it all moves around. And that ugly app icon...",2
"Unlimited Curated Playlist ability, artist information and fun to have similar artist recommendations made from my taste in music. I learn about new music from Spotify.",5
The app is not working from the time of update. i am unable to login hope that is sorted so that I can listen to songs like always...,5
"Very restricting. It makes me wanna pay for premium, but I don't want to. If u don't have premium there's alot u cannot do. It is not enjoyable, it's frustrating, it makes me feel forced to pay for premium not like before there's no ""6 skips per hour"" and before u can play your liked songs in whole version. Before it was all good I've used this for a year and half now, but I'll stop now cuz it's very restricting.",1
"legend has it this is the best streaming app, but i think the legend kinda lied 💀",4
Ihave enjoyed this app but i think u need to make an option to download a song,5
I just wish that there were less ads for someone looking for continuous music for stars.,5
"They seem to want to force you to go Premium? It appears that once you start a track of songs, you cannot remove the notifications and auto starting of the next song(s). Sometimes I just want to listen to a few songs and not the entire track. I haven't found that possible. So while the quality is good, the freedom of choice isn't. Uninstalling....",2
I want to say that it's a very good app but I am not satisfied with the ads 😕. When I am listening a song i am in a mood and the ads spoil my mood😑😑,4
"I can relief from the stress and problems by listening to these beautiful songs.,THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS.",5
"I've had Spotify for a long time and it has been overall the best music app I've ever had. I would have hands down given this app 5 stars, but I'm upset with the new update. It used to have a scroll on the side but no longer has it in the new update. I have 1500+ liked songs in my Library, and I now have to scroll through 1000 songs just to get to one song I wanna listen to. Sure, I can search in my Library, but then it won't auto play all my music. -Edit- The scroll is back! 5 stars!",5
Too much of ads song by ad song by ad 😠 how to i lesion the songs,1
Pretty good experience when you have premium,5
"Great selection and application. There were issues with the android auto earlier, but they have been fixed",5
"I've been listening to Spotify for a few years now. The look has changed, l like lt. I can find the songs that I like. And change them when I like.",5
Great to be able to create own Playlist from 1000 of choices,5
"No video on Web OS. Spotify has one of the worst apps - constant glitches, and now I can only listen to it on my TV? No thank you - that's why people prefer youtube...",1
I like following Luke Bryan and they send him my way just as if i mentioned other country western singers. Luke is my favorite and his songs lite up my space!,5
Awesome music application. Fought using it over Panora for years then was forced to do to getting a Samsung watch. Love the fact that you can pick your songs. Way to go Spotify! I'm a believer 😌,5
"I hate this app because y'all add songs to my playlists,and I can't pick what song I want to listen to because y'all randomize it.",1
Recommended by a stranger once and has been a good app to use,4
Very*1000 nice having lots of best song,5
App is constantly playing music for no reason. Requires a force stop and then the app will play music again lol. Easiest unistall of my life. Use YouTube music its way better,1
So many problems. Songs don't play keep pausing or stopping want a refund for the last month,1
Best music listening app 10000000/10,5
Search history or playlist not saved,3
it has a lot of the songs i like but there are some that aren't available (mostly anime openings and endings) but overall its great except the ads that play consecutively like 5 times in a row,4
Best app for songs of every artist lover,5
Great app. Appears to have most of the music I like. The only difficulty I've experienced is downloading so I can listen offline. Any tips?,4
literally the most frustrating and irritating app ive ever used. the free version is rubbish and gets on my nerves.,1
Such a nice app yeah sometimes I can't found a few song bt its ok and everything is perfect love to listen it n 1 of my most fab app✌🏻😇,5
"Am I the only one having poor audio quality on Spotify. I have tried loud, and chosen the highest audio quality too",2
"Have downloaded music for when I have no service or wifi as my work requires me to be in dead zones a lot. Sadly even though it's downloaded and essentially in offline mode. I still can't use any of my downloaded music cause the app itself refuses to load. Used to not be like this but past few months to a year it has been. Let alone shuffle just shutting off or the app just doing what it feels like doing. Fix the issues. Enough apps take ""bug reports"" but do nothing. Don't be like those apps.",1
Easy to navigate and has all my favourite music,5
"Nice app, But it contains too much ads.",3
Great music app..... lots of choice. Only listen occassionally so I don't use premium but still enjoy the control over the music and the choice. Having to listen to some commercials is absolutely fine.,5
"When I go to my playlist on my phone it will always say ""something went wrong have another go?"". Can it be fixed please",5
It I is very good nice quality use this app and your mind will be free from any bad things,5
New App. SO far so good after 6 months will add +* PS. Best of all types of music!,4
"I love this app. I have premium, which is totally worth it. It's so easy to make playlists and find new music.",5
"Ossm for music lovers,it's really good",4
Too many adds,1
Great music app professional 👌,5
It's an app that is easy to use and convenient for listening to your favorite songs!,5
Has all the music I listen to! Quality is good too.,5
Can't listen to my music it always pause when it plays,1
What's the point of being able to download music if it's just going to delete my downloaded music the day after and force me to go back online after if I want to listen to my downloaded music? Stick to Apple Music or Tidal. Spotify doesn't care for it's users.,1
"This app is tiring now, every playlist I make it skips song to kabza de small album I don't want to listen to. STOP IT",2
"this app is a really great music app , however whenever i make a playlist they always put in songs that they'll think I'll like to my playlist, and its a great thing to some people but it gets tiring hearing songs that i didnt put into my playlist, its sort of annoying. But other than that the app is great.",4
Pls fix Spotify. Its keep on crash while i listen to songs before this are not like this.,5
Audio is very clear and Spotify has a large selection of music.,5
It is an exceptional music app as it covers most of the songs,5
The Reason of giving 3 stars is Why my Call Recordinga and All Open in this App I don't want to play me recordings in this app Spotify AB Please I am Begging You Please Fix This problem🙏🏻🙏🏻,3
"App works fine, but if you don't have premium it's more ads than music. Also worth noting that you can't type in a specific song and listen to it without paying for the service.",2
It has its problems and it won't work and when I use it on Xbox it just crashes everything.,3
"Great app, however I do not know my password to log in on my other devices.",4
"I can't even pick the song that I want to play, I can't even skip the songs I don't even know or like. I downloaded this since I thought it would be like hte PC version, well it is worse.",1
Only but a big reason for 3 stars. I've been using for nearly 2 years and I loved it but for the past few days I've been having trouble with 'searching' songs and I thought to reinstall thinking it might work but the worst part is I can't even sign in or log in now... I miss it... It would be so kind if I can get it back. Thank you,3
"I really do enjoy the amount of music this app has, but I have gotten 8 ads in a row once. Would rate higher If they would chill out on the ads. You can have some but spending more time listening to ads than the music is unacceptable.",3
This is the very good app and I am use 2 hours in a day and this is the one and only music app and the high quality music and the enjoy the non stop music in whole day buy the Spotify premium and enjoy the next update,5
Incredible use and selection. Multiple devices and really great service highly recommended.,5
"Get rid of the "" Hidden"" button. I accidentally hit the button but I could not find an option to bring the song back. Thank God, I was able to figure out the name of the song to add back to my Playlist.",5
"It's a good app, I've been using Spotify for a while and the only problem I have with this app is that when ever I'm listening to music, it will crash and I will have to listen to the song I was already playing. That's the only major problem I have with Spotify.",4
"Spotify gave me the opportunity to make my first ""play list"" ever! I love it!",5
Only Ads some songs,5
"Without premium listening is hell, also it adds songs to your playlist that you don't want.",1
It is the best app for music but it is only a fault that the song changed then to face many ads .,4
Nice app but having some issues okkokkasari app open cheyyagane back ayipothundi and malli two'days tarvata open cheste malli normal ga open avutundi soo konchem aa issue anto configuration cheskoni fix cheyyandi,3
Do give selected songs do apply for the songs and reviese it after a week and do keep my words and select the songs as I'm the user of your app and also I do use songs app the whole day and night .,4
"Have the premium service and I can pick the song, the artist, or the genre of music anywhere, anytime I like with no ads or interruptions. Unlimited skips if something doesn't fit my groove. Play straight through an album, a Playlist, or go random through liked songs. Even voice commands with Google and integration with Waze are a breeze. Two thumbs up 👍 👍",5
Hands down best music streaming App Nothing else comes close. I've experimented with other platforms but nothing compares. When my friends tell me that they don't use Spotify I tell them that they're absolutely crazy. The podcast options are the best too. Joe Rogan's podcast is by far the best podcasts out there in Spotify is the place to get it. I am known to be a negative person but I have nothing negative to say about Spotify except for making me use 500 words to write this review. Holler?!!,5
"Spotify has the best selection of music with an easy to use plattform ,there always updating there criteria so your more likely to find music youve been unable to track down on other plattforns its definantly my go music app for all my listioning needs",5
Wonderful and easy to use music app,5
Gotta love free music and podcast. Thank you spotify😁,5
I've got premium and it's nice but I can't figure out how to clear my queue? I even open the queue and there's no delete or clear option. I'm on android and the app is updated.,4
Ads!Ads!Ads annoying me,1
5 ads is the usual number I have to listen to that is why the app is losing users,1
I dont mean to be rude but spotify need to get their act together. The problem with Spotify is that it loves to undownload tracks whenever i go for a walk while its in offline mode and its inexcusable and really frustrating. Spotify team please fix this problem,2
I love but it gets really glitchy.,4
"The free version of this application is garbage, many artists have gone up and said the amount of money they make off of Spotify isn't a livable amount. (the distribution of how much they pay is the cause of this). Another thing is the first party bot accounts to try to take even more money from the artists. The limited amount skips shouldn't exist with a lack of pay. Another thing is the mid tier UI, the massive amount of advertisements, and non premium quality even with Spotify premium.",1
"It's got everything i've searched for and suggestions, Excellent!",5
"Easy to use, great selection and they recommend good music to my preference.",5
I'm confused why it doesn't play my custom playlist on the right order and sometimes it plays music that wasn't even on my playlist.,1
This app is so so so so ruined they have to make it so I can at least choose any song I want they can keep any other feature all I want is to play my favorite songs that's all and they have ruined pls make it so you can choose any song you want,1
"I'm a paying customer. It crashes constantly. The ""player"" disappears.... I've cleared cache\uninstalled \restart\reinstall.... No help. Think I'm going to be canceling the service. Brand New Pixel 6 Pro ALL updated...",1
"Listen on Spotify every day. If I want to listen to a particular artist, I can.",5
"it's very easy to use, I love, it's really good without premium but it got even better when I bought premium! :)",5
I can NOT turn off shuffle mode.. even though it's off. Half the time the song I pick won't play. And any song that's played won't play again.,2
Too many ads,1
"Perfect, sometimes glitches",4
"Originally I rate Spotify with 5, but I wanted to calmly go to sleep soi search for mediation sleep and I choose a recommended list... And? It cut my went to sleep with a terrible advertisement to pay for premium. I will delete all meditation list.",4
Great selections for every mix and road trips.,5
I love the Spotify because so many song upload in playlist😁😁,5
The best experience for music and podcasts!,5
"I love Spotify, if you love music you will love Spotify",5
The songs in my liked songs were in a order. The newest added or liked songs were at the top now its became a mixture if it's going to be like this I am going to uninstall the app,1
"Been using the app for ages, now I can't even connect it to my speaker. Why do you people constantly change things that aren't broken... It's a music app, why make it more aggravating go listen go MUSIC, I don't need to use my phone as a remote. The remote group session kept literally kicking me off my Bluetooth connection.",1
Don't know what happened but app extremely buggy lately,2
"Never likes any streaming apps, they were BS and gave no real advantages. But I could not live without spotify. Often when my playlist ends, auto play similar songs works so well, that I find new songs I like and don't even notice that playlist ended half hour ago 😅 also, app itself is really good, like it a lot, I can download songs to play offline.",5
It's the best music platform I have ever seen even you can listen the song in your playlist even tho when your one day data plan is over and that also kpop pop and many more that you keep in your playlist I love this but the thing is that I am facing some problem to set ringtone with it but it's ok,5
I love that music is made available for me The playlist diversity The podcasts are both educational and entertaining And last but not the least the payment plans as well as student discounts which is very helpful and love it that even i can easily afford the monthly fee Keep it up Spotify Co.,5
"This app stopped working with my Android phone. I've updated, checked settings, and reinstalled several times over the course of weeks. My phone isn't old, and I don't have problems with other apps.",1
I'm extremely grateful that Spotify manages to support 'even my'spesiific tastes for the earliest vocal music from the 10th century through to the exceptional violin & cello music of the 15th through to the 19th & 20th century ! - It takes all sorts !,4
The app is crashing in my gaming phone,4
"sangat bagus , This application is good for those of you who want to listen to music",5
"Great app!! But could you please provide the song listen hits as an option?! ALSO, sort our liked list based on how many times we have listened to a song and give them our listen hits too?! Thanks!!",4
Don't like ads,5
Absolutely horrible ads all the time forces you to buy premium,1
"really good music app with a few audio books like Solitaire by Alice Oseman, but lately it has been glitching to the point that I have to install it, log in, use it, and delete it multiple times! when it glitches, it plays but doesn't let me go to where I wanna go to in the audio book",3
I like this app very much but it should be offline and I like it to hear without internet so I like to give only 4 stars,4
Trying to open but it's not using my password,4
Love all the integrations of this app that is everywhere,5
It's a good app for music.,5
Best app to listen music of your choice.,5
"Nice , after ignoring ads .",4
To much ads. But the app is best. 3 stars because of ads.,3
"After a while, my account was unable to be edited and my username appeared as random letters and numbers. Whenever I tried to play a song, it would play a 30 second ad and then do the ""You'll get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" thing. But even though the ad was over, the timer was still counting up. I couldn't do anything on the app and all of my playlists had been removed, as well as my search history. 🙃",1
Shuffle is broken. If the songs are in the same order everytime...it's not random is it? Currently paying for Premium.,1
When you change country it's will ask you so many things..to change country .it should update like other apps,1
Love Spotify can't be without it just wish they had some of the old 90s house jams,4
"I don't know if I'm doing anything wrong but I can't seem to listen to the songs I want to listen to. Doesn't matter if I've made a playlist or not, when I click the play button it plays every song except for the one I want.",1
"why my phone always restart, when i try to open this app.",2
Spotify has always since I have been usin it fulfills my expectations by far as far as knowin what me as a listener loves . And that's tha BEST music app for tha BEST MUSIC. 5⭐s in my book all Damm day Homies.,5
"Would be 4 stars if the app didn't just decide to no longer let me search or add new music. I've had spotify for years and never had this issue. Premium member, app up to date, phone up to date... fix your app before I go elsewhere for my music.",1
"i can't choose what song i want i can't skip, not like before update why? do you need more money?",1
Best music experience ever,5
"Where is the 0 star option. I have this app on my iPad and I love it, but on my Android I just want to listen to a song. Not c co Pletely different song when I click this song to play it I want to listen to a song in my playlist but of course Spotify has to add unnecisarysongs to it. I just wanna listen to a song I get having an ad I between every 4-6 songs but I GET ADS BETWEEN MOST EVERY SONG AND THEY LAST UP TO 1 minute. I downloaded Spotify because I heard good.jut download YouTube.",1
It was good at first but then I searched the song and it gave all playlist.The searched song was not coming,1
"I can't see my ""Now Playing""😭 It doesn't appear in my notification bar also.",4
Worked great initially but then had sound issues,5
"Was great for the 14 day trial. After that nothing but adds. Went back to my old streaming service, for free. Guess I should have paid more attention to the reviews and wouldn't have wasted my time.",1
"Pakistani song played on Indian plotform, how could Spotify do that? ... Very Disappointed with this cheating.. 😡😡",1
No words to say it is awesome. But adds are the problems .,5
I like this better than Apple Music.,5
Great music experience.,5
Need a break from the ads?,5
"It's really amazing and comfortable, I love it",5
Great app for music....,5
Simply awesome. Quality of music is good. Best part is it's algorithm. Which u want to listen it just offers that in time. One thing to Spotify developers - pls enhance the music quality better than now. We want more quality. As of HD quality.,4
I'm definitely enjoying my everyday listening to my playlist. It's best when you go premium. 👌,5
I love and have no commercial breaks,5
Best music platform ever,5
I have very little to no issues most days on this app. It's a really good music app.,5
Your favourite music always with you ❤️,5
"The app is tremendously great. The features and everything is convenient ranging from category of music, lyrics of the songs, and etc. The only thing that I find odd is the volume of the songs. They play somehow quiet in the Normal volume range. I suggest that you try to make it louder at that. The lyrics also should be downloaded offline also in case you want to sing but do not have available WiFi connection. That is all. The app is wonderful. But some adjustments would be fine.",4
"Love everything, so easy to navigate and I always find my favorite songs 👌🏿",5
Obviously Spotify is 1 of the greatest platforms to listen & enjoy music & the same was for me until Spotify started idk what happened but whenever i open Spotify it just doesn't have any of my liked songs & like there is nothing there & when I try to put on a song by searching it.. it just doesn't play & i feel that they should do something about it . I uninstalled and installed the app 8-10 times and it works only once after i do that. I hope if any1 is having the same problem please reply.,3
i love to hear music at Spotify bcs it's doesn't have copyright music,5
One of the most beautiful song application another apps,5
This app I can describe . There is no words for this app. But there is a problem there are so many advertisement inbetween the songs and which makes me annoying . And all other things are mind blowing .,5
It's pretty good app for songs or playlist I really enjoy it,5
Songs downloaded does not get stored in device. It remains in app library.,1
Every 10mins I play a song it crashes and it's not okay,1
Pls make group session can joinable from discord.. not link.. like. Idk. But like desktop,4
It's great that you can make your own playlist,5
Please correct all the lyrics in every songs and add the subtitles !!!,2
"Terrible, terrible experience. I can never navigate anywhere, the player plays music but doesn't show the controls/timeline, spins forever even if I have episodes downloaded, just an all-round fail.",1
"Brilliant, everything I want to listen to is right here.",5
"Kindly do remove adds that related to religious,, Often I'm seeing Hindu related mantra being played during the adds interval,, Kindly look into it & resolve it asap ,, let's not disturb other religions!!",1
Super but high mb can take please change this best app in world,5
"Love it! The interface, UI UX, stopped using all other music app... But I am finding it hard to make payment tho ..",5
Great Absolutely satisfied with Spotify.,5
Music is my favorite hobby and I love listening to All-America and pop songs,5
Excellent service good choice of music,5
this app is a bomb with so much music and wide range of songs.But the ads are a little bit disturbing for me.,5
"Couldn't find anything, wouldn't let me see all the songs in a Playlist, an changed the songs in an album",1
Quick and easy access to a wide variety of music. I particularly enjoy their Christian Instrumental selections,5
I'm using it for 2 years but I am facing problem in log in in my new phn. Idk why is happening help me.. as I travel long journey to my office. I need Spotify with with in that particular time.,4
Great always there with good tracks.,5
"I love the app. If a 90 day trial period with premium were available, I could REALLY love it after experiencing it full on. It's a great app though.",5
If not for the amount if humongous ads for premium the app is best for itself,4
Absolutely love the wide selection of song choices,5
Not working with wifi networks,1
Not able to login after the new update even after trying all the methods,1
I love the selection of playlists and being able to build my own.,5
This app is good but there is lots of ads 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄,3
Doesn't fail to stop depreciating everything; leaving for better services once I get my playlists moved.,1
I have a recommendation for spotify team and developers please do not make it require more than Android4.4.4 kitkat I have this Android version and manys also and I want spotify on all of my devices Bed spotify lite require Android 5.1 and spotify update also start require Android5.1 so sad 😓 and I make it one star to see my recommend bec u r reply only on one star rate but after that I will change my rate 5 star I love spotify so far,1
Unable to connect when try ti subcribe to premium.,3
Cannot live without my spotify,5
Great app....love the playlists,5
"My experience on my tablet can't be faulted, however, my experience on my smartphone has become frustrating because it isn't the same anymore. When I initially downloaded app it was just like the tablet but now it has become frustrating & unusable because I cannot choice the tracks or songs easily. It's no longer track or song orientated but album orientated & I cannot select the tracks I want but instead get given random tracks. Can anyone suggest a fix, so it the same as my tablet's Spotify?",4
The search taking time and keep having to go back numerous times to restart search again. Missed the whole premium part it seems.,2
Any song any time anywhere what more could you want,5
"I've had a reoccurring issue where whenever I play some episodes from REAL AF with Andy Frisella the app would crash, and I'd have to try to play it 3 times over before the crashing stops. Please fix this.",2
"So much choice, a song you heard and forgot about, you can find it again! B sides etc.. Great app.",5
"No adds in this music app, love it❤",5
It finds your type of music 🎶 or suggests something in your taste of music it delivers!!,5
Good sound quality,5
This app is beast songs hearing music app,5
Best app for listning songs,5
"It would be better if we can set the playback speed for the songs we listen, for example, that feature will have provided us to listen faster or slower, depends how we want, it can be similar like in YouTube.",5
All Good. one thing is missing which is in resso app the party mode.,4
"Great music app, premium is even better.",4
UI is just a hide and seek game for me I am using it on Redmi Note 10pro and there are no icons in app even not next track or previous track nothing i just have to guess the position and do things everything is invisible please fix this,1
This is amazing music app after installing this application I never think about other applications.,5
Perfect app worth the price!,5
Premium is loaded with spam and commercials. I didn't see any difference for the premium service. I contacted them and no one ever responded. I dumped the premium service since they don't care. Poorly ran company.,1
Adding other songs to my playlist is very annoying,2
Love Spotify! Cariety and ease under my fingertips.,5
"My review was deleted again why? Spotify is good if you pay for it, after each song an advertisement i had more to this review but why should i write a 400 character honest review if it's getting deleted without warning",1
I use Spotify a lot and enjoy the range of music available. I have been introduced to more artists which great!,5
"Great variety and good data base. Try to download music, not providing an option and been using spotify premium for more than a year. No contact details to request support or assistance",4
Really amazing aap .... all latest and old songs available easily.....,5
The best feature - group session queue... And you have completely broken it.,3
For some reason its accessible on my laptop but when I try on my device it just doesn't let me login I and I can't understand why,4
This is fire. No problems with it and uts super easy to use,5
"Writing's not that easy but grammarly can help. This sentence is gramaterly correct, but it is very hard to read. Download grammarly now😍",2
"Hi spotify, I would like to suggest spotify to include romanized lyrics for non-roman language writing song such as k-pop songs. It will be very a great and new experience for us. I will appreciate it if spotify include this improvement soon. Thank you!",4
A good app but their should be free download,3
I love Spotify so easy to find music and listen to great music whenever wherever,5
Overall nice app but download option for songs should be there without premium,4
Has all my music but same but I use this app everyday,5
"This is amazing and Awesome app for listen any music 🎶 . Those people who love to listen the music and streaming. So, this app is really amazing.",5
"!!!! The best app ever, wenn it comes to Music",5
It won't play my mix or sometimes song that I'm searching for. Itll just play some random songs. I recommend you just download spotify on your pc,2
"Its great it's beacuse of the free trial of the premium, but the sad part is I can't shuffle the songs anymore and doesn't have a special features. Please we all want those experience especially with us music lovers, and high up our colors in these musics.",3
I love this app and everything it has but its been crashing way too much lately,3
Too many ads... No one can bear it for that!!!🤬🤬,1
"App crashes a lot recently, I pay but still have to listen to adds",2
"Not free, actually money grabbing app. Can't skip after 6 times and can't fwd.",1
"For some reason it always remains open in back ground. Every time I get off of a call and am hooked up to my Bluetooth in car it resumes playing music. Every time I get a new notification the bloody app is sitting open on top of my notifications. I've gone through all settings, but seems this app just wants to be in constant use. Over rides other media apps that I have playing in car and sometimes plays simultaneously to other apps. Seriously annoying. Am considering cancelling my subscription",1
"Great app👍 Constructive feedback: desperately needs a function for changing playback speed (American ""authors"" often speak so slowly, with long pauses between words, that their podcast can become tedious) Edit: Still bright blue adverts for bat-flu info in the app, it has come and gone already - Im sick of hearing about it. Deducted a star.",4
Songs skip to another one or just stop for some unknown reason...but otherwise I.love.it!!,4
"even in the newest version(8.7.38.667), I still can't view the lyric",3
"You can't play songs you searched for , they play me a playlist instead of the song plus the song isn't even in the playlist ! I hidden every song on the playlist expect what the one I wanted to hear and it still won't play it and starts playing the hidden songs , this app is juts terrible , don't waste money on it .",1
This an excellent app to listen music. I really loved experience on this app,5
Very expensive premium for Tajikistan((,4
Fantastic app for music lovers,5
It is good but too many ads I suggest you reduce the amount of ads,4
30 minutes of no ads of you watch this 2:30 later ads,3
"a bit of suggestion to spotify, could you add an on and off setting on recommend songs? it gets annoying when random musics starts playing in my playlists! if you add it I'll give a 5 star rating, thanks.",3
Fantastic! Lyrics perfect! Recommended!!!,5
Without internet I listened the songs and enjoy my daily traveling,5
Very nice app with wide selection.,5
Great but more adds,4
Premium is awesome and never bugs out 🤞,5
"Spotify was always my go to app when it comes to listening to music. I've had premium for a while but am not able to afford it anymore, wich wasn't really that bug of a problem before but now with the new update it's almost impossible to use for free. Like, making being able to listen to songs basically only for premium users?? C'mon, it's not like spotify doesn't have enough money. Don't stoop so low",2
I wish you could download music without prime,4
Too much of ads Really fed-up Getting 4 ads in one go,3
I have charge $5.50.I think is free but still paying,2
I love Spotify this a good song app,1
Am giving 2 star because am in Nigeria and I can't even subscribe. Will be uninstalling the app soon,2
"The application was telling me to enter to my account,I have my account connected to my Facebook account,but it did not let me enter to my account because there was an error,I decided to connect my account with my Gmail account and when I opened my account of Spotify all my Playlists where gone, I try to ser if I could recover it on the website and nothing,it was 2 years of compilations and everything to hell, Thanks Spotify.",1
This very.. nice app.. for music.. and podcast.. And their are many artists.. you make own playlist.. 🙂🙂🙂,5
The last update was fine because you had a chance to play your songs in order or not. on the phone I'm not a fan of the new update I can't even play my songs in order it's only playing shuffle when I try to listen for a new song so it goes to a different song,3
"I wish I could rate this app more but that's definitely not happening. My experience with this app has been nightmarish considering all I wanted to do was listen to music. First, this app is about music, right? Well, in my case, the music DID NOT EVEN PLAY. It would show it was playing, but it wouldn't make any sound. I can assure you this had nothing to do with my device volume. As for the playlists, THEY NEVER EVEN LOADED. This does not have anything to do with WiFi, either.",1
The best app with music & radio !!! Congrats !!!,5
Can't wait to listen to ads before the songs 🥰,1
"Please remove the ""smart"" shuffle to be honest it's not smart it's dumb when I click the song I want to listen it gives me a song don't want no wonder why people think SoundCloud is better your app will fail if you keep this up",1
Fantastic App. So far I found every track and album which I searched. Can't imagine why I did not start using Spotify earlier. Thouroughly enjoying the vast selection of music...,5
10 times better than Pandora and YouTube combined I love Spotify,5
I love listening music on Spotify,5
Excellent app. All types of songs basically available here,5
Enjoyable and excellent performance,5
The song recommendations are good but the only issue is that at times when I have my earphones connected to my phone it would randomly start playing some song like that's really annoying if u could fix that then I'll rate it 5 stars and the ads are really annoying,4
Very nice but Dont Advertasment,5
"I can't get the app to play a playlist. I choose a playlist, shuffle and it plays one song before randomly playing songs that aren't on my playlist. It also defaults to one song when I stop listening. A year later from the above review, and the app intermittently stops playing my downloaded music. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the problem persists.",2
This app is really amazing and I would recommend you to try it,5
Video playback doesn't always restart without a full app closure,2
It's as if I'm hearing the music at a live show and gazing gayly upon the bands I love so much.,5
Nice app because of listening music all the time 😃,5
"very good app, but if no membership you can't play the song you want to play",5
Pretty good app overall can be a little slow sometimes like when I'm in the car it takes a while for songs to load when there downloaded and u have to have internet to look at the lyrics even if the song is down loaded 😆 lol,4
I love every genre of music that Spotify offers,5
"Okay. Spotify often doesn't give me what I search for, and when it ""does"", it often doesn't give me what it said it would. The next tracks are similar, but not from the same artist. YouTube sticks to one artist mostly, but introduces you to knew people too, so that's better. YouTube gives you what/who you searched for. Spotify plays in the background, so that's better than YouTube or TY Music. YouTube 2 Spotify 1. YT Music is basically a poor man's version of YouTube, so no point there.",4
This has just become trash spotify before was better it doesnt shuffle and had no ads and it had unlimited skips unlike now the owners want money cause they think everyone can afford premium while. Other people just wants to listen to music youtube music is better than spotify my opinion but people probably hate spotify too cause of the shuffle and ads,1
Love this app but the ads are irritating and can't listen to my fav song offline,4
"Its very informative that Joe Rogan chose Spotify as their main residency for their podcast. In my own experience, Spotify is the worst app I've ever used. Everytime I have to use it I despise. It keeps crashing. I use a s21 ultra phone There is no reason I should have so many issues with this all alone.. Of jre did not switch, I wouldn't usr Spotify at all. Spotify. Just improve your UI and stop sucking",1
Many Punjabi songs not available on this app like sohni sohni song i search a song many times but reasult is always same .,2
Please try and upload correct lyrics of the songs and also the provision of translation.,4
"Simple, quality, clear sound Easy access to many jonneras of music at your fingertips",5
I Likes Spotify! recommended,5
Too much ads i hate it,2
"I create a Playlist and I can't play song from that Playlist, because Spotify plays other song than that one. Wowowow way to go guys.",1
Spotify is the best app to listen to music on.,5
All the music you want and more....,5
Its truly a great app however few days back it just switched the whole thing allowing me to only preview the songs instead of listening them by simply searching them.,3
This so amazing app and mast song,5
Expect ads everything is good,5
Many ads irritating,1
I hate Spotify because with out premium u can only skip a couple times and when u search a specific song u hardly get that one without listening to other music and if u make a Playlist they add random songs and they usually suck,1
Pretty much only amazing if you buy a membership but reasonable price for a great product,5
It's never letting me play my licked songs or my playlists anymore SCAM,1
"Spotify has given me the opportunity to listen to my fav podcast, MORBID!! I love it!!!!!!",5
Liked it a lot . It is easy to use the app and also can be played with slow internet access. Only problem is ads but overall that's the best app among all the music playing apps. Thanks Spotify Team for it.,5
Unless you pay for premium membership you get to listen to 2 songs then a load of adverts. The shuffle feature plays a small selection from your playlist of about 5 songs. This has improved slightly over the past month but still not great. The 30 minutes uninterrupted that you occasionally get isn't 30 minutes and on occasion has only played 3 or 4 songs. Sometimes you play a song then it just stops for no reason at all which is frustrating. I'm fast loosing faith in the ability of spotify.,2
Please add a feature where I can shuffle all my playlists! I will give you 5 stars❤,4
You cant go into your playlist and play songs in order like you could before now you HAVE to litaen to it shuffled,1
Not only is it expensive it doesn't work and goes down intermittently more and more I am honestly thinking of canceling and going to a different service,2
App does not give me the song I want is extremely difficult to use rather opt for deezer,2
"Excellent , not too much adds",5
Easy listening experience.,5
"After uninstalled for months I am reinstalling this app . The previous reason for unistallation was , There were issues like we can't hear we want instead of it we have to went through playlists which we usually don't like and also '' THERE WAS NO FREEDOM OF HEARING "". Hopefully now there wouldn't be forceful policy to opt premium version.",2
I love listening to playlists made by my teenage kids.,5
Really wonderful and useful aap,5
You need to look wynk their have very less ads and your app are full of ads please do something,4
Great way to listen to all my favorites for the 90's and 2000's.,5
Excellent service good listening,5
I love spotify but i dont like the suggestions in my playlists that actually play.if i wanted those songs they would be there.thats a really annoying new thing going on.,5
Who can really fault Spotify? I use the paid version but it's very much worth it.,5
Super Amezing great app my old song all getting nice,5
"I don't know if this a glitch or something but when I tried to press the play button it played another song. Please fix this, also again, I don't know if this a glitch cause I'm new to this app. Thank you.",2
Love this! My kind of companion and the9 SC band's as well!,5
Great app and songs. Very user friendly. Thx,5
"this application is the best find for listening to music. however, for the last month I've been seeing the loss of features that are very important to me (like previewing songs before adding them to a playlist) for music and podcasts. plus, I can't add new podcasts to my saved ones now :c it's becoming more glitchy with each update and it's really disappointing because it's a premium version upd.: the support never helped but sent me the google form link to grade the support work...",1
So much music! Global reach...make magic for us...we all need it ... everyday!,5
"Only thing, that you cannot download songs in free version. The makers can limit the downloads to 40-50 so that one can listen even if he is out of network",4
Sonmany add after every song Hope so they will understand problem by the way I am enjoying Spotify a lot Thank you 😊,3
Pixel 6. Android 12. Cannot slide the categories under my liked playlist. Fix before my next billing cycle or I will most likely cancel my Premium service. I'm not paying for crippled software and service.,1
Great finding all the songs I want and ones I never knew about,5
Best music/song app ever..i highly recommend uh,5
i enjoy the music here.thank you spotify for the free music!!!,5
Very nice app It is the best music +songs app ❤️❤️❤️👋👋🥰🥰💝😃😄😄😄😄😄💕👍👍👍👍👍👍l like this app,5
"Best music options, I like the mixes they crate new for me everyday.",5
I give five star ✴️ amazing app music 🎶 quality very good and,5
Ads after every song ridiculous,1
Really easy to make playlist 😁,5
Its so good and cool...But I want to listen to it for free without using the internet.,4
Music quality is not high otherwise it's nice. One star deducted for low music quality,4
Just a W app. Helps with my workout routine 💪,5
Great job at finding music that I like,4
This is a best song 👌 spotify,5
"i kinda hate this app now before it was great and when the updte came in its a whole new trashbag my issue is it stops randomly and there is no skip button when a 30 or 40 second ad came in and when i create a playlist for myself random songs just came in even if i didn’t added it but im still not gonna delete this app since its the only app that i can listen with but please fix it its forcing me to use premium even tough i have no money :""D",3
EVERYTHING you could possibly need to enjoy ANY music from anywhere! !,5
I've had Spotify since 2014 and I used to love it but now I get all the same music over and over there's never anything new or that I enjoy. The app NEVER suggests actual new music within your specific niche. I'm seriously tired of listening to the same songs and artist over and over. They should sincerely consider whatever algorithm YouTube has going on because this sucks.,2
No way to see all songs by an artist. I don't deal in albums so i have no clue where one song is in 20 albums. Wont be payong for premium again.,1
"Am really enjoying myself with the app, is really a moving truck",5
Best music app compared to all other apps,5
Please increase the audio quality.,4
"id prefer it if we had the option to search overall for a song in a folder in the library tab, but other than that i enjoy using spotify",4
"It's a good app but the only downside is it won't play the songs you want to listen to. Fir example if you try cklicking on a song, it won't play it, it will play a radio bassed around that song.",4
Thanks to you Spotify..,4
"Auto recommended music , sounds quality sharp , bass just perfect to go along with all song.",5
Selection of song is very easy Enjoying,5
App sucks. It pauses when my phone screen goes off. Phone screen needs to stay on in order to keep music playing. Even the downloaded music and in offline mode. And even though I've allowed Spotify to run in the background. What is up with this ???????????????? So annoying and frustrating !!!!! 😫😫😫🙄,1
How can you guys okay with your app..I can neither log into nor make a new account...how inappropriate. I've been trying from so long but it all gone waste. I can't enter in your app. It keep saying something went wrong. I don't know what is wrong on creating a new ID. Just something you guys.,1
I just loved this one... without ads non-stop music🤩🤩,5
Spotify is best,5
Amazing app 👍👍 all songs quality amazing👍,5
"Well i guess the mixes are good enough ... still prefer if i could play my favs freely tho... you know, like how it was supposed to be...! Plss bring it back plss plss plss.asdasdsdsdssd",3
Excellent app with out any disturbances,5
"My podcasts keep stopping once my phone screen turns off...didn't used to do this, did it constantly today. If I'm paying for a service it should work properly. Just installed an update yesterday, but you've obviously got some more work to do...",1
I wanna kill my self bc of this it won't let me loop or play the song I want it never did I don't want it to shuffle pls make it a option to turn it off and on it driving me nuts bc I can't do the things I want I have actually cried over this many times bc I was so angry,3
"App is good. However, seems a bug. Intermittent issue observed when phone tries to go on landscape mode, Spotify fails some of the time. Pkease get it checked thoroughly.",3
App always freezing had to downgrade,1
"Try to sign up but it say my email already connected to another account. But, I cant even ""log in without password"" or reset the password, alway crash.",1
"I've been enjoying spotify. Since I've got spotify, the interface, the music playlist, just everything has been great. I have a google home and pairing and using it for music is seamless, It automatically syncs with all my devices. Turn off my laptop and pick right back up on my phone. I recommend even the free version is worth it. Trust me, you won't regret subscribing to Spotify.",5
I like this but I kind of have a little bit of Doubt but I like this app because you could still listen to your music even though you turn your phone off and your off of the app you can still listen to the music so I like Spotify,4
Wonderful there are literally all the songs in the world,5
I've had no problems and love how you can customize the audio to a bit,5
Why I hate Spotify is it doesn't play my favorite song it just plays a random song and when I skip it it says Slowdown you get 6 skips per,1
"Such a all rounder app , All at one location , Really loved it",5
Great way to keep up with what's new or binge listen fav's.,5
The lyrics are so good. It feels great using it.,4
"Lit app, especially when you're either alone or with friends. I just don't like the fact that their are less ads on the when using a computer and when you use a phone their are much more ads.",4
Good clear music no adds love it,4
Spotify is #1 in the world 🌍.,5
This is worst...it shows too many ads..although it shows that after one ad there won't be any ads for the next 30 minutes but if you close the app and reopen it...it will again show you ads..just here to criticize it for being so greedy for earning money by showing ads..whereas ....its primary function is to let us listen song peacefully rather it ruin our mood sometimes by showing irrelevant ads..this app literally forces you to buy their subscription,1
They do like music and stuff.,5
"EVERYTIME I LOOK UP A SONG IT WILL NOT PLAY. THIS IS THE WORST APP. IT PLAYS EVERY SONG BUT THE SONG I CLICK ON. Please update and fix the problem. It has worked perfectly until now. AND SAVE YOUR MONEY, DONT PAY THE SUBSCRIPTION.",1
Easily the worst app experience I've ever had. Every update messing up so many things. UI still confusing and terrible. App isn't registering when I am playing a podcast or song. And randomly stops playing some times.,1
"I'm getting tired of all your YouTube ads back to back, and just your ads in general are way too long",1
Good but on my phone When Free Trial ends puts all can't do much,3
Best music app ever totally worth the $10 a month no annoying ads I can repeat as much as I want and I love that you can create your own private Playlist.,5
THE GREATEST!!! Tried them all and I always come back. Great sound quality and sooooo easy to use!!!,5
"Loved it before! but now I can't preview any of the songs in my add songs section. So I can't put anything new in my playlists. Not cool, please fix",1
I like the music selection and the ease of Spotify,5
"Confusing. No play bar anymore cant pause or next or stop. The song will stop suddenly, I have to reopen the app to get the song play",2
Itf works But pay to change gets a star knocked off Better than radio when you just want to jam,4
"Great music app, good for all kinds of music.",5
I love using this app. This is one of the only apps I need in life. You can organize playlist for different moods.,5
"Dismal. Cuts out, constantly having to reboot, shuffle repeats the same songs from a playlist within 2 hours when there is 100 hours of music on it. Appalling",1
"Terrible app. i have used this app for years to come but now I have to pay to listen and choose my songs now because my ""14 day trial"" has ended, this is just a big pay to listen app and it adds stuff fi dont want in my playlist and removed alot of stuff that you could use for free to premium users only. Old spotify was better,SoundCloud and YouTube here I come!",1
Nice app but ads is problem,4
I really enjoy Spotify it includes all my favourite podcasts.,5
Love how it finds other songs that are in the same Era and adds them To my Playlist,4
Spotify please can you have a chat feature??? hshshhs i wanna that!!! 😔😔,5
The now playing/media control bar has started to randomly disappears after a while if the app has been backgrounded and you cant get it back unless u fc the app 👎 Edit: still broken ill make my own instead,1
It don't turn off when I go to different apps,5
"I preferred Spotify stations where I could listen to just one artist without the app deciding to throw in a recommended artist because ""I might like them"". Also this app has a tendency to just turn itself on when I try to open apps such as Facebook or Google Maps.",3
"Love this app absolutely. One thing I would recommend is listing ""Hide this song"" lower in the drop down of the details. I have hit it accidentally a few times and haven't been able to recover the songs.",4
Spotify has all the music I need,5
"Solid service with a huge range, good recommendations and a easy to use interface. Totally worth a monthy subscription for premium",4
Way too many adds,4
I wish they can make it to where you can play a specific song by itself without playing extra songs,1
"GET THE EXTRA BUTTONS OFF MY SCREEN! They cover the information to the content I'm interested in! WHY? For nearly 10 years the Spotify community has been begging for an explicit only filter. If you look at Spotify's own reasoning for having explicit content in the first place it's ""to present the song the way the artist intended."" Yet they daily force edited versions into my content. And right above where I'm typing this it says that Spotify is always changing. Just not for the better huh?",1
"Don't know how I've managed without it, absolutely love it👍",5
I Do Not Like This App Now Why: Because When It Updated They Made It So You Dont Chose Your Own Song To Play And You Dont Get Skip Your Song Spotify Change It Back Now,1
Good variety of shows.,5
"The worst FU$%!@& app ever made its not user friendly, terrible to use i cant listen to the album I want to or the way i want to because shuffle has to be on i cant stand this app but its the only place to listen to certain artists/ podcasts its a huge pain in the @$$ i hate this app with a passion so much because its so bad i cant even deal with it to listen to DRAKE its so not worth it because of the app I just want to look at a songlist for an Album that came out can't even do that needs fix",1
It's so easy to access on and offline. Definetly recommend because of it being such a good app for music.,5
Good podcast and music,5
Does the trick! Learns what you like well.,5
Love it I can always find what I'm looking for,5
"I got logged out of my Spotify account and I kept logging in but it said ""Something went wrong"" can you resolve this problem?",4
"If I could give this 0 stars I would. I really don't see the point of not being able to choose the song you want. And in addition to this, when you search a song and click on that song, it plays a completely different song. Honestly what the hell is that. Who else agrees? Never thought I would be saying this but I'm switching to SoundCloud, SCREW YOU SPOTIFY!!!",1
It has all kinds of great music that I like to listen to,5
"Wow... this app is totally amazing 🍷, love it❤️ , keep up the the good work spotify 👍🏽",5
Its amazing usually but lately i go on spotify and go to library and all my music is gone same with my playlists are empty,1
Please add an option to shuffle all Playlists. How is it 2023 and we still can't do it?,2
"Don't download it, not worth it. I'll stick to it until i find something else to listen my music on, they are ruining the free version to rush users into buying premium, basically removing free services just so you buy premium. Maybe if people left even more bad reviews, they might think twice and see what they're doing wrong.",1
Love this app. Totally worth paying for premium,5
What happened to the podcasts? I used to be able to select one and it would take me to the last episode I listened to. Now it just starts at the top and I have to scroll through 300 episodes to get to the one I was on. Not cool.,2
I love listening to my favorite songs playing in the background. I love this app that is why it deserves 5 star rating.,5
I can't play MY PLAYLIST without playing a raido with songs I've NEVER heard before,1
"Wish it wasn't so limited in available bands\songs, but the app itself and it's features work great.",4
"I'm using this app for many years now and it has become one of my most used services ever. Nothing gets close to Spotify's convinience and ease of use. I couldn't live without it anymore. I espacially love the huge library of music. No other service gets close to that. And the discoverability of new music on Spotify is unmatched, too. But pls, work on the following! Pls, -fix Spotify rewind (didn't run on my old device) -release spotify HIFI in the EU! (I need high res badly) Thank you! :)",4
"Spotify is always my go to for music. Update June 13 killed the speed. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it but it now takes 20+ seconds to skip or respond to any action. I hope that gets fixed soon or I'll have to shop elsewhere. Too bad, because I use it a few hours a day",3
I hate the amount of skips you have only 6 for every hour plus it plays songs that aren't on your playlist like fix that it gets in my nerves but overall it's a good app it's just those dumb things they need to fix,2
I really like how it has so many choices for songs. There are many different artistes too.,5
So far so good. Still limited by only getting to choose one music genre/ style unless you make a playlist. I want the freedom to choose as many styles/genre's and be able to listen to music my way especially when I am paying for it. Has a large selection of music but is also missing a large selection.,3
Amazing 👏 recommend this app with the premium feature,5
Don't like Spotify adding random tracks to my lists,3
"Plss fix your app, it's hard to use, what the heck, all the songs and playlists shuffled play I can't even play the song I want because it's shuffled even though a song isn't included in the album There are also many ads Plss fix it 😢btw I'm not angry I just asked for a little request on spotify🥺",1
It was nice hear how the new/suggested songs sounded like but now I don't have that small preview and it's really annoying,3
Really bad when I search up a song I di find it but it takes me through a whole Playlist and I can't skip. However when I do find the song I want I can't put it on repeat I remeber back them you could. Spotify explain,1
Veri slow to load up and move thru.,1
"I love it, spotify is amazing!",5
THIS IS TOO BROKEN IF I CLICK THE SONG I WANT THEN WHERES THE PLAY BUTTON!? AND IT CAN CHANGE SONG WHEN IM TOUCHING THE PLAY BUTTON THIS APP IS BROKEN,1
Lyrics are not loading most of the time! Please fix this!,2
Really didn't want to use a app on my phone for music my son talked me into it he said the even have music for us fossils so yes its brilliant definitely recommend this app👍🇬🇧,5
"It is been terrible for the past couple of weeks I can not access the app when my network data is on and data is actively working. I have used different network data but still have the same problem. It is really frustrating, fix it thanks",1
"It's significant for me, I highly recommend him ... But if there are some updates on widgets, It will be more great for me 🤩🤩",5
Updated it now playing on other devices is a problem. I can't consistently connect to my laptop. Previously I could but now it's a problem. Updat is trash,3
By far the Best music app love it! Still #1! Every update gets better!,5
Great love that I can make my own Playlist easy to do for a senior person who loves old and new artists. THANKS.,5
Great but the radio is terrible. They just play the same songs over and over. They will play the same songs from the album you just listened to as soon as radio kicks in... lame.,5
Still trying to get it to play more than one song without restarting.,5
I loaded up Picked up a bunch of Groups Within 5 minutes I was up and running Certainly not like the other app,5
Terrible in app experience. No playlist selection can make up for the UI.,1
Kind of sucks how it's only in shuffle but at the same time I think it's a good thing because you don't have to decide what plays next.,4
"Love the app and the ease, but the thing that lets it down most is the integration with Google Assisstant. Asking it to play one track and you get a completely different one. I don't know which end has the issue but it definitely causes a lot of headaches.",3
It's a good app i can listen what i want hehe,5
Great as long as you can cough up 10 bucks a month,5
App is good but now sharing in snap chat is glitchy plz fix it 😊,3
Good app but needs to have early 2000s remixes and Indi pop songs,4
Good starts up as soon as I get in my vehicle and very easy to switch to different albums.,5
Its amazing! But not ALL sorts and forms of songs are available mostly the ones with top views are there not more...also stupid ads,3
"Best music app you can download! Has every single song/artist you like listening to, different mixes depending on your mood, and podcasts to listen to if you're not in a music mood! If I could I would give this app 10 stars, that's how amazing it is!",5
Ok it's fine just 1 thing. Stop adding random songs to playlist just based on my music taste that I can't remove. Its annoying. I dont want them there.,4
"Most annoying app ever. forces you to listen to complete songs from artist you do not like. Saying slow down, you only get six skips per hour. I can understand happen to watch a commercial but to make me listen to a complete song before I can move on?",1
Spotify is wonderful. Premium is worth it. (Edit) Group session very rarely works and it would be great if you guys could work on that and fix any bugs. It's one of my favorite things about Spotify.,5
"One of the best music app,to listen and discover new music.great selection and quality plus very user friendly.",5
"Spotify please stop putting suggested songs I don't want to listen to in my playlist we only get 6 skips & no I don't want premium I just want to listen to the songs I put in my playlist in peace & now to add on to this the preview songs is no longer available making it hard useless trying to discover new songs/music, it's aggravating .",2
First 1 weaks very nice but 2 weaks app was log bug not change next song not use Burton's very many bugs very bad experience 😡😡😡😡😡,2
Love it best music app,5
"Wish it would work right.. doesn't show controls (or anything) in notification bar like other apps. constant updates, never see any changes but you better update cause it'll steadily glitch if you don't. Itll lose my place or just suddenly end a podcast early.. Kinda sucks all around. This will probably get deleted like my last review",1
This is one of the worst apps I am forced to use. I loved Spotify and was happy to pay the $12 a month but for that I feel like I should get an app that works. One that opens and doesn't freeze every 5 seconds. It's been months now and Spotify does this thing where it doesn't show It's playing at least twice a day and the only way to fix it is to restart my phone. You should expect to lose a lot of customers over this. Update: it's even worse and doesn't play sound when it shows it's playing,1
Hard as hell to set up and when ever I use Bluetooth the sound automatically goes to quiet and there's no way to fix it,1
"9 ads just to listen music, you're gonna listen to more ads than actual music.",1
services are soo slow its my 8mb connection and it is taking almost 10 secs to play any song why ?,2
"We’re always making changes and improvements to Spotify. To make sure you don’t miss a thing, just keep your Updates turned on.",5
"It is impossible to shuffle play all downloaded tracks. People have been asking for this simple, highly useful feature for years. Before that it was actually possible. Apparently the folks at Spotify have never been on a road trip through the mountains or on a flight with no internet connection. In the forums, their answer is to build a playlist; this answer is condescending and unhelpful.",1
"Love Spotify. Gives ads, you can pay for Spotify premium tho, which is great for listening offline.",5
Just the most amazing musical experience in and beyond the multiverse! In a nano second of time you create what used to take me months and months and months to do. God! I wish I had this tech 25 years ago! Spot-on Spotify Spot-on.,5
"I've been using the free version and I loved this app for 2 years, but recently the ads have gotten so annoying. 1-2 ads is okay every 4-5 songs but I have gotten at least 2 ads in a row after EVERY SINGLE song and I even got 6, 30-second long ads in a row today! They also removed the preview version, so now struggle to find new songs.",3
Love it always manage to find what I like to listen to,5
"Recently I can only listen to 3 or 4 songs before the skipping starts and the music quality is unbearably bad. Contacted support 3 times, they didn't even engage in trying to fix it, just no interactions in the chats the last 2 times. Will likely cancel subscription if I can't get someone to try and address this over the weekend.",1
"Garbage - only plays songs NOT in my playlists, even with every conceivable setting to prevent it.",1
Very few glitches Works 99% of the time Too expensive but best option,4
"Without premium you only get six skips an hour. It won't let me manually change songs, so when I am on a song that I don't wanna listen to and I'm out of Skips I have to deal with it or pay for premium. This problem is only on phone. On my tablet it's the perfect music app. Unfortunately I can't play any music on it without Wi-Fi on my tablet. Spotify sucks without premium. You're already getting money from ads. Do you really need to charge me to enjoy your app?",1
It has a nice variety of music and podcasts but it very often stops working so I have to Uninstall then reinstall the app to get it to work again.,3
"Used spotify for YEARS! love the platform and will be a user for life! The yearly wrap ups of all your top songs is great and lots of Playlist variety! You can find almost any song you want, even soundtracks. 5 stars!!!",5
Love listening to music I want to hear.,5
Love Spotify.... I have used it for years!!!!,5
Listening to music without any break!🎧❤️,5
It is really good I have made about 50 Playlist and even I'd you don't get premium you have to deal with some ads and come on a fue ads won't kill you it's better then most games nut anyway anyhow Spotify Is really good,5
I can't listen to my music and I have to pay with is unfair and recommend do not download. I always have to listen to other music they recommend but they all suck. It's better to just hear music on youtube,1
Much loud ads after every song,3
I can't play the song itself I have to listen to the entire Playlist and even when i make my own Playlist it adds its own songs,1
"It's an awesome app, you can play it outside of the app even if you're device is off. But Spotify does everything in it's power to keep non-premium users from having cool features. It's really dumb to have limited skips and your playlist doesn't play in order on mobile and you can't loop your songs unless you're premium other then that it's pretty good but just a few premium features that should be regular.",4
Making it different from other's is Podcast.... Love the app,5
The new update is very bad.I can just hear a few seconds of my songs in my playlist,2
Most recent update has completely bricked the app on mobile for some reason. Please fix.,1
Has just about everything u can think of and easy to use,5
Best music streaming app ever,5
I like the app but I don't like that you have 6 skips per hour because I don't like sitting through a song that I don't like. knowing I can't skip it,4
I think this company is very sneaky when you want to cancel something they make it very hard you know I guess they just want you to keep paying for a service that you don't use anymore so they make it difficult for you to find where the cancel be wary of these kind of companies cuz the only thing they care about is milking you for every penny you have and when a time to get rid of these apps they make it hard,1
"So awesome getting music, podcasts all easily available 😀",5
I can find most songs. I had to reload the app not to long ago. No phone support kinda sucks,4
Love the free music and library,5
I like it a lot. I pay for premium so no adds. I don't make playlists or do anything fancy. I put an album on and let it play then I pick another. I like that the app shows new music from artists you like. You have to click follow on the artist but it's no biggie. Plus it shows support for that artist. I like that it will show you concerts coming up from your followed artists. All that said for how I use it it is five stars.,5
It is good with or without paying for premium,5
Too many ds!! It's not a music app but an ads app now!,5
I am unable to login again !!!! Worst app i have ever used to login 🤬🤬,2
Experiencing issues while searching for a song sometimes. It shows no internet connection even if i am connected to one. This is very annoying. Fix this,1
its a good app when im in a bad mood,5
I use Spotify for everything but I am quite disappointed not angry it's a bit disappointed that you have to get premium to skip as much as you want and I'm also not big fan when you type in the song you have to go through like a whole playlist then you get your song like once I typed in the song and I had to wait like an hour till I could actually get the song that Iwanted,5
"Really tired of the glitches on Spotify over the last few years. Sincerely thinking of switching services. Have to consistently Force Stop and reboot app so that user controls (ability to pause) show back up. Also despise the fact that it boots automatically when linked to my car...annoying if I am not expecting it AND it should be optional, not automatic.",3
Pretty much has turned into the same handful of overplayed songs and ads.,2
THE BEST APP I CAN'T AFFORD PREMIUM BUT STILL ITS THE AMAZINGEST APP HOLE UNIVERSE,5
"I love Spotify, but the latest layout change is too much. WHY CHANGE SONETHING THAT WAS PERFECT? AHHHH!!! Don't make me use YouTubeMusic, I might like it more.",4
Its great but not a five star because it will control your volume if you put the volum low it will ture it louder,3
Great music. Easy to use and many artist to listen to as well,5
I don't have premium doesn't mean you can add ad's after every 2-3 songs ...it sucks ...please fix it.. Overall app is good but this is the only problem that is irritating.. Edit -- It's getting worse ...seriously ...there so many Ad's ...it shows that get 30 minutes of ad free music but after 10-15 min ...an ad pops up ...and sometimes there are 2-3 ads too...,1
For some reason this app is now trying to open all of my personal audio without my permission and there is no option to stop it. It is not my default audio player and I can not open it any other way. Horrible.,1
App is grt but pls add feature to see wot frens are listening to like pc,5
Spotify the best,5
No problem with my music list. Everything plays and no problem with loading the songs,5
"The slowest app on my phone, by a large margin. Have tried signing in and out, uninstalling and reinstalling, turning phone on and off, clearing cache and data, everything. This app doesn't run, it saunters with a cane. Also, no way to disable annoying podcasts...NO I WONT LISTEN TO BRO JOGAN",1
Song is cutting when we are pressing back button,1
The best music app for years,5
I love loVE LOVE my Spotify. So many memories from the 90s rock playlists!!! And classic to new Metal 🤘💯🤘,4
With the new updates and all it's filled with glitches and bugs... Disappointed,1
Oh I really liked to can use this app but it doesn't work for me at all..my problem was because of using vpn and I couldn't use it without vpn either! ..idk why it said turn off your vpn..I got a little sad :),2
"Beautiful app,thank you!",5
"The app keeps randomly stopping in the middle of listening. It also won't register what I'm listening to while I'm in it, so I can't skip songs or anything else. It would be great if this issue could be fixed. I have found a ton of good Playlists and podcasts I enjoy, this is just a real pain.",4
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE APP BRUH ???? I stopped using for a while and now I just came back and everything is lagging to extreme cases to a blank screen altogether ... Probably will go with YouTube music ... What a disappointment ...,1
Love the discover weekly and how easy it is to share music and playlists with friends.,5
Just freeze on the splash screen on my one plus 7t,1
"I honestly don't care what people say about Spotify, I mean a lot of people now hate Spotify and rather listen to songs on YouTube instead. It's most likely because you have to skip songs just to listen to the song that you want, but like if you hate or don't like Spotify than you're just something else (impatient is what you are) any have a good day and don't go on TIKTOK. I'll leave a 5 star review on TIKTOK check bit out.",5
Best music app I have used the best thing is you can down load podcasts to listen offline. I recommend listening to scared to death,5
Can't control the enhanced list. When sharing a session on same network with other users can create IP conflict if the host session finishes,2
It was good for 1 Yr but recently spotify keeps saying no internet is available.. though ny internet connection is good in other apps.. I have reinstalled the app. Connected a different internet.. cleared clache.. but still it says no internet available.. kindly fix this problem,2
"Great app love the podcasts and music selection and suggestions. However, the latest patch I've been getting soft crashes and play bar disappears. Relaunching resolves but it may take more than 1 attempt",4
Good but so buggy. Constantly stops working or does weird things. I like what the app offers but it's annoying to use.,3
HORRIBLE I cloud not play one song by its self I tried playing this one single song but it was playlist that had the song in it that I wanted to play so I tired skipping to the part I want but its says I can only do 6 skips which is a dum set up your forced to listen to songs you dont like until u get to the song you want so I tired doing a playlist with only songs I like but then spotify decided that it should add a buch of songs I dont like so then there you are waiting for the song u want.,1
Love ❤ the way the music is selected.,5
"The new update were you can only skip 6 times,it's not nice and is really annoying",2
Worst support... contact support many times all the time they won't solve the issue and tell this is something our customer support can't resolve,1
"For a music lover, like me there is nothing better than this...",5
"Absolutely terrible on mobile. I can never use the mobile version because of how stupidly unbearable it is. How come PC version has unlimited skips AND can play any song in the playlist and mobile can't? And why can't i just make a playlist without other reccommended songs being randomly added and i can't get rid of them? Literally the worst music app, i swear. I can't even play just ONE single song wothout having to play a whole playlist just to get to it. I dont know how people can use this.",1
Bestt app ever... But I would love some changes such as bring the three dot option in search results only so we can add them in queue if we want secondly please add features to make playlist collobrative through app and also to re arrange songs. Overall this is bestt in the music streaming platforms. User since 2011,5
Love Spotify! Listen to any music I want anytime!,5
Stop muting my PC when I'm playing through my phone OR vice versa!! I want the option to play both playing at the same time!! THIS SHOULD NOT BE A PREMIUM MEMBERS FEATURE! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,1
Now it had became such a problem 😑 TOOO MUCH ADVERTISEMENTS!! 🥲 Pls...🙏🏽,3
"""I love this app! Its great! It makes me listen to my favorite songs and music. Its easy to use, accesible, and reliable"" -what i would say if this app actually works. It doesnt even play the songs that i played. It plays a totally different one. The app is actively FORCING me to buy premium buy how? Not working. Literally impossible to use without premium. This app belongs in the trash along with youtube. They'd make great friends.",1
Just the way I want a music app. Switched from YouTube Music.,5
Always good and easy to use,5
Nice Music app op !😃😃😃,5
Nice and free music app,5
I can't have a lyric displayed on my spotify. It's been almost a 3 year problem of mine. Maybe someone here can help me out.,1
It A very nice app all kind of song are there. And all of your favorite artist are there love it live it,5
It's free and plays all my favorite songs and sermons without skipping . We love it,5
Click on app and click on artits and music comes out,5
Great app. Couldn't do without it.,5
"Best app for music, I'd recommend this app for music lovers ❤️❤️❤️",5
Since the update I'm having trouble starting up the app. I have to go into settings 4 to 5 times to clear cache but even then when I do get in it still takes awhile for playlists to load and for the play button to work,1
"Library was wiped, no songs will play",2
Love Spotify! Been my number one used app for several years!!,5
omg spotify is AMAZING it does have ads BUT if you use the web player then it's easier to use. i toatally reccommend. i have been using spotify for a few years and it is still awsome :),5
App frequently crashes and loses control on my z flip 3.,3
Irritating App with Ads in between at irrelevent timings. Wont recommend..,1
App easy to use and no glitches ever. Love diverse music collections!,5
"This app is the worst when it comes to listen on bluetooth. Always disconnecting, pausing and restarting what you listen to and the app will just stop working in general.",1
Great music keep it up,5
"WHY THE HELL DOES IT KEEP ADDING SONGS, JUST LET ME LISTEN TO MY OWN SONGS! AND SO MANY ADDS. YOU HAVE TO PAY TO BASICALLY EVEN USE IT.",2
Love this App...i was stoked when it was applied to the xbox platform,5
It's straight forward everything is there. Although they should minimize the amount of ads there a lot!,5
Amazing app.. I love this app.. and this app is far much better than any another music apps....,5
love it all ways works and never lets me down,5
Song has clear sound to hear and better qlity. But advertisements is length so over tension to hear the song,1
the new update is horrible it shuffles every song you play nd doesn't even play the song you ask for instead it shuffles it and you can't even skip a song you have to wait until it's finished nd they give you a 6 times to skip everyday I used to love this app so much but now no again the new update is terrible.🤦🏽‍♀️,1
"One word, Amazing!",4
"Update 6/17: Still very glitchy and very frustrating. If I pause a song/podcast and then try to open the app to play again it does a forced closing of the app. App has been very glitchy lately. Not showing a play bar, having trouble starting songs or podcasts. Also wish it would save your spot in a Playlist when you bounce around to listen to different things. It saves my spot in a podcast but would be nice if it did the same in music Playlist (such as New Music Friday or Discover Weekly).",3
"Nice app, but includes way to many ads....",3
Evrything is good but lyrics are not showing up on myspotify. Like in my friends phone the lyric feature works properly but its not like this for me,4
It's just amazing only this😊,5
This app is amazing it has all the artists and songs I want,4
"Easy to use, less adverts. Allows me to do other things whilst listening to my favourite music. However not too happy with limited skip song in an hour.",4
I hate it because everything I play a song it is change and when I want it to play over it never do!!!!,1
"It's easy to move around the app (in comparison to Apple music, last time I used it). Also finding what you are looking for is simple.",5
"every app ask for 5 star , but this app clearly deserve that",5
"In my opinion Spotify is a great app/software for music but the thing is that I have premiun and there isn't that much you can do in premiun except downloading and no adds and that's kinda all, they should add more things to premiun",4
Too much of ads,3
Get the music of your mood.. Anytime.. Anywhere!!!,4
Thank you for bringing back the ability to preview songs before adding to playlist!!!,5
They give the perfect lyrics and I enjoy clear music,5
"The free version of Spotify was awesome until the new update you can only do six skips an hour and can't pick specific songs. It's horrible, I'm switching back to YouTube music.",1
Awesome. This is best music app by far,5
Love love LOVE the Spanish ads!! Always wanted to fine tune my multilingual skills while cutting grass! Please play more of those. I don't know what they said but I want to order 10 of those right now!,3
50% of the time the app crashes when you start a podcast. Genuinely one of the worst apps I've ever used. It just crashes all the time,1
Keeps kicking it self out. So annoying. I have that it plays 3 songs and it cuts out. Need to fix,3
"Have to get premium, or the ads drive you unhappy.",4
Good song quality and less ads... Highly recommend,5
Has been crashing lately when trying to play music or podcasts,3
"I have no idea if something's wrong with my Phone, but the new GUI is so confusing now, I can't choose specific songs on my playlist and it forces me to listen to suggestions, this is not improving the app in any way, shape, or form, please revert this back to the old GUI.",2
It's very useful and helpful,5
I love Spotify.,5
Just Great music love it .,5
I have downloaded this app 6 times in a week and it keeps disappearing from my phone's apps. I don't understand why it keeps doing it and I'd like for it to stop but idk how. Help??,4
The so good with good music,4
Please where did the shuttle button go??? Or is it just my phone or what?? As in what the hell is going on?? How would one always play the same songs all the time#borinnnnnnnnggggggggg,2
"Lost count, how many times i've had to force stop this app... ...at least twice a week!!!",1
Problem with specific song selection,2
I play a song that i want and it plays something else i disabled autoplay same thing i also cant even play 1 song no playlists or nothing im gojng back to youtube smh 🤦‍♂️.,1
"It's free and enjoyable to easy one's soul with joy. Thanks, Mr. Valentin Colon",5
After latest update app crashes every time it's opened,1
This app is amazing and it's sound quality just wow,5
The app is great loads of music and affordable the app does have a tendency to act up where the pp won't display what your playing so you have to force close the the app to pause or stop audio playback.,4
Great app love the music have the best,5
It was gd. Bt some songs are not fully available and Some songs lyrics r not available.. So I'm posting 3 ⭐️⭐️⭐️rs... 🙂,3
In this app we can also listen k-pop song to in other app we can't listen these song,5
"Spotify used to be a great app. But recently, I cant do a thing on the app. Random songs will play. The music I'm listening too will just stop entirely, and the app constantly crashing.",2
This app is very good for music lovers!This is very good recommendation!,5
"It has no drawbacks or anythingas such. But just way to many advertisements, all about Spotify. Only that has to decrease a bit",4
I can listen to any songs and that's what I like about it,5
Great!!! Easy to use.,5
Can't rewind can't play the specific song I want why is it always the shuffle button can't I play the songs that I actually want?,2
"The update is honestly WAAY too restricting.The forced shuffle feature on every user that isnt on premium is just...so unappreciatedable to the point where its clear that,the only target is money. But if you just wanna listen to music this app would be alright, The quality of the songs that are played are great besides the whole forced shuffle thing",1
Now playing controls disappear on a Samsung S22 Ultra. Only remedy appears to be to restart phone.,2
Always begins with shuffle and shuffle can't be stopped. It does play music so two stars. It's not usable in my car.,2
"After 1 hours(Non stop) used this app and I think after 10 time advertisement I received that, Why should I get a premium a/c?. And I realised this app creator does not care about if I'm listen music through their app(when I used in free), I cannot get into a mood of my favourite song list (like songs) cuz advertisement always interrupted me. When 2nd or 3rd time I received advertisement I think I must get premium. But after 10 times, I'll never waste money on this app, I'll uninstall this app.",1
"Absolutely Terrible. I used to like this app but after it's update I despise it, it updated the ""music in background"" so you can't play it in the background or when you turn off your phone anymore. Giving this a one star, hate it and never using it again.",1
It was good at start but now when I play any song the app closes by itself. I tried a lot of things but nothing works.,1
My Spotify app has stopped working completely. Can't play a song. Every playlist is shown as blank screen. Please solve it. I need Spotify.,2
best music experience and no Spotify without harry styles,5
"Through android auto, Spotify is loud for the first couple of seconds. Then the volume dips, and the music is only as loud as you speak, despite being cracked to the max. All other apps through AA or the radio/Sirius in the car don't do this. Why does Spotify keep shting the bed? Problem solved: bought a tesla with built in Spotify.",2
Bc of the advertisement all ways ruing my mood,3
"I would give spotify a 5 star rating, but out of the blue it started cutting in and out inside my house and out in the yard. Spotify works great in my vehicles, I don't get it, it makes crushing beers outside less enjoyable when you have spoty music.",3
"Stop running gay pride ads in my Christian conservative podcasts. It's blatantly an obvious attempt to push the alternative opinion in it, and it's going to make me cancel spotify for taking an immoral abhorrent stance. You are a content provider, do just that, stop picking sides.",1
The volume difference between music and ads is atrocious.,1
"The playing now bar has disappeared again, and it keeps happening. There's no way yo pause, stop, or skip music without it. This has been an issue for over two months. Fix it spotify.",1
Good Playlist and providing opportunities to upcoming music talent also.,4
Too much ads.,1
Botched everything up recently. Please make it better or back to how it was.,1
"We should have the option to remove Podcast recommendations from our profile. I don't listen to podcasts, I don't care about any of them on here. I also shouldn't have to reselect the ""Playlists"" tab from the My Library section every time I navigate to it. Let's bring some actual customization instead of more ""suggestions"".",3
It great but I just don't know how to play music from the new update because if I press the song I wanna play it just plays a part of it if someone could tell me how to play a song I'd be glad,5
I'm giving one star ⭐ because the application giving advertising even one song. Before some time the application not give advertising even one song so please fix This ads.,1
...Spotify is my favorite Music App!!...love making my own playlists!!...,5
Great app for streaming music,5
It makes no sense that you can connect to Bluetooth headphones to listen but not too your smart watch to listen without a premium subscription,1
You broke it. This last update causes the app to crash constantly. Unusable.,1
"Spotify is a great app, however it has a few hiccups. 1, it's ads for the free version. The ads are a nightmare, instead of 1 or 2 every 30 minutes. It's 3 or 4 every 15 minutes. 2, downloaded songs have a little downloaded emblem in the playlist. It disappears sometimes and having a 100+ song playlist is a lot of storage space. With all of that, Spotify is a good app. Premium is almost required but it's only 9.99 a month. I love the podcast selection they have too. There's something for anyone!",5
"The app keeps freezing, shuffle automatically comes on even after clearing my cache and daily mixes will change part way in to the first song compared to what songs were initially shown.",2
"Why is it when I search for a song, and find it, I can't just play it. Instead I have to shuffle and play a playlist that it's in - get a grip Spotify, I won't renew my premium until this issue is resolved",1
I love it but the only thing holding me back from giving this a 5 star is the car UI now being a premium option.,4
Nice app.but when I try to play a song that's In a Playlist all the songs come up and I can't hear the song that I chose.i will rate this a 4.5 out if 5.,4
Always recommended but you always need a strong internet to play songs .,5
Full of adds,1
This app is amazing. We can hear any type of songs we want. And the best thing I like that there are lyrics also available. Just love this app 😍 ❤️ 💖🎵🎵🎵,5
"Awesome! Thank you so much for such a wonderful app, i can listen any music and podcast i want. Thank you developer for free, you have a big heart.",5
Great for finding music I missed or had forgotten,5
The only thing that keeps this app going is the fact that it uses less battery than YouTube and Apple music isn't available to Android users. You can't even rewind a song without hearing 3 ads. Then they tell you that you have 30 minutes of ad free music. That lasts until you click a song. Or for about 10 minutes. What the hell happened to this app??,1
"It doesnt let me play the song i want , it just shuffles to a diffrent sobg please change this.",1
Best audio quality The music app ever I seen,5
"I like the app, but I don't like that it is always stuck downloading songs in the background and gets stuck until I open Spotify. Idk if it's clever marketing to get the user to open the app, or if it's a bug...either way it is very annoying and has forced me to consider canceling my premium after years of being a subscriber to Hulu/Spotify. I'm sure no one reads these reviews after reading a few of the others. Shame on you spotify",2
Stop adding music we didn't even add,1
Good flow of enriching songs,5
Very neat. Really good UI and very enjoyable,5
"What the fk is happening? Occasionally pauses, sometimes turn the volume up without any contact with my phone, that lies comfortably in my pocket! Why????? This is getting too anoying! update 17 06 22: it wasn't the app, but 3,5mm connector in my phone all great now",5
"I used to love using this app, but now you have to pay inorder to listen to your own music. The mechanic is overall really stupid and annoying",1
Wish it wasn't pay to listen offline sadface great app still,5
"Been using this app for years even use it while playing my PS4, but lately this app hasn't been working like it used to. Automatically skips to the next track without even asking/hitting next track, on it's OWN. And then a lot of music I had saved on my playlist starts to disappear without me editing the playlist, there one day gone the next. It's really weird that this app does that A LOT. Used to rate this 5* their lucky I'm rating this 3*.",3
All of a sudden app doesn't want to work. I can't play anything nor does it show my Playlists. I've had to use the browser in order to listen to music which doesn't make easier when driving.,1
I really love this app but it has 1 problem. Some of the album covers on Spotify have inappropriate cover and appear as an NSFW. I feel like this should be removed as there are kids on the application as well.,4
Very easy to use,5
After years of listening to other apps Spotify has won me over.,5
"logs out off your account for no reason sometimes, lost my account once. ad plays after every song and not thirty minutes unless you have premium. but a great music listening app regardless.",3
Love this app! I am always able to find music thst I loved growing up and that I love now to add to my Playlists!!,5
Keeps updating now you can't even click on a specific song from a. Artist gotta play threw shuffle for 4 hrs to get the 9ne song you want to listen to,1
"The bloody autoplay feature just won't stop! It keeps playing random songs I don't like and didn't even added to the Playlist despite disabling it in the settings. After playing those annoying songs, ads roll in that lasts for like a minute or so. Instead of putting me in a good mood, it did the exact opposite. Don't use this app unless you have the budget for premium subscription. LISTENING MUSIC ON YOUTUBE IS WAY BETTER THAN AN APP LITERALLY CREATED FOR LISTENING MUSIC.",2
Wonderful! Awesome! Spectacular!,5
"I used to love this app but these ads have gotten out of hand. If I have to listen to this many ads, I'll just close it and go to pandora...",2
I'm using Spotify almost 2 / 3 years ... Nowadays you are putting so many ads it's irritating i 2 ads to listen one tamil songs stupid ... I'm going to un install worst experience 😡👎👎👎👎👎,1
App keeps crashing everytime I open it and as a paying customer that is unacceptable. Please fix.,2
Love how you can build your own play list and play off line wouldn't be without it now,5
"So many bugs. Doesn't work smoothly in airplane mode, when you should still be able to listen to downloaded episodes. Also crashes occasionally.",1
I feel using spotify is much more comfortable than any other application. It's super good .😌🌼,4
I love the lack of commercials and the fact that I an play things up to 3.5x speed.,5
"I enjoyed listening to my music new and old, especially when I'm on my runs,bike riding.music free your soul and spirit.",5
The best music app out there.,5
Even tho I payed for a premium plan i dont have podcasts available,1
Bug reporting: Cannot share a remote session with someone. When they open the link it just brings them to the Spotify homepage. The year of our lord Jesus Christ is 2022 and for some god foresaken reason I am sat on a bus and unable to listen to music with my girlfriend.. Why Why Why,2
Very very good music from Spotify,4
"Alright Spotify, what'd you do? Did most recent update 2 days ago and now the app crashes upon opening every time. One star until fixed!",1
Very good music app,5
"The song radio doesn't work at all. Also i have spotify premium and when i listen to podcast, i get ads.",2
"PLEASE FIX THE UPDATE, IT WAS ANNOYING!",2
The song quality is very good,5
THIS APP SUCKS NOW THE NEW UPDATE LIKE I CANT DIRECTLY PLAY THE SONG I WANT I HATE THIS APP NOW TF!!!,1
"I made a playlist specifically dedicated to a game, but theres also songs that spotify automatically adds and theres absolutely no way to disable them, so therefore this absolutely ruins my experience in every single way, shape or form",1
"It would be great if there was a ""listen later"" feature that you could add artists your friends recommend to you in the moment.",4
We want a stunning looking widget for Android 12,5
Lots of music wich I love but spotify needs to pay their music artists more money.,4
way better than pandora. Whatever algorithm it has it knows what I want to hear. it doesn't just randomly put a song I hate or the same song on there. And not everything's mainstream and the podcast are the truth.,5
Spotify is the only music platform that's goes the extra mile for both artist and listener,5
"Now look, Im not sure if this is a problem for everyone but it is for sure a problem with me. Not sure if it is a new update, but whenever I try to listen to one of my liked songs, It only plays a small part of the song. And whenever I search up the song. I have to shuffle it with ""recommended songs"" that I wont even like. Not only that, but when I shuffled my liked songs, it doesnt allow me to go back to a previous song. Please change this, I at least want to enjoy music in a freedom-ful way",3
The most non user friendly streaming service I have tried. I would give it zero stars if I could.,1
tbh Spotify is great just i wish they had slowed versions of songs like YouTube does,3
"Recently it's become just awful. Too glitchy, sends me podcast recommendations that I don't even watch, the volume becomes high then low then high again randomly without me doing anything, it's just an overall horrible experience",1
"I've been using Spotify for a while now, and a premium subscriber so no ads. It's a pretty decent app. The problem I have with it is the random genre of music that is thrown into your daily mixes; with no option on the app to delete or change your preferences. They'll say keep listening to your favourite music and it'll change over time, but it doesn't. It gets pretty annoying real fast when you're seeing recommendations constantly from genres you've never listened to. Please fix this.",2
"Great application but I'm kinda disappointed that i can't download the songs anymore even though i pay the spotify premium mini and pop up texts that said ""device limit reached"" even though i only downloaded 20 songs (max 30) and only use one device",3
Love it. I can have my music any where. 1 downside if my son and I use our account at the same time. one of us will have to use our downloaded music.,5
Good app but the audio needs to be authorised,4
Absolutely useless allways off-line why?????????,1
Please make sure that the panels don't lag on low internet connection. Why would I have to wait so much time just to add a song I have downloaded to my queue,3
"This app has become a problem, why do you always have to download all the songs over and over again after you did it for the first time. Buffers all the time, will crush out of nowhere. And all that on premium. We don't get what we pay for.",1
"The app is good, but the lyric won't show for nun of the songs",5
Good App..Doesn't have ads between songs and has a wide variety..Let's you explore new genres....,4
Impossible to use on lock screen anymore. Tried everything I could find Samsung Galaxy S20 FE Android 12,2
