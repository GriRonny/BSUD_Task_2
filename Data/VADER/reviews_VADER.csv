"I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline.",0.5226,positive

"Hi spotify when I listen to my favorite songs, I'm getting poor play back quality. The songs are freezing right in the middle of the song. And it's not just one song, it's doing it every time I listen to the app. I tried Un installing the app, then opening it up again but no difference. I won't need to continue Spotify premium, hopefully this gets fixed so I can come back to enjoy my songs.",0.7579,positive
There are some bugs to work out with the Bluetooth pairing when it comes to this app knowing where to play the sound. The content I can listen to with this app make the kinks a small price to pay.,0.25,positive

I absolutely LOVE my spotify app! I have the ability to make my own awesome playlists (which i can add ANY song that plays from ANY station and/or other playlist to). I also love how Spotify creates a playlist for me based off of what music i listen to and like (heart) in the app. And their is definetlely a HUGE variety of different songs and types of music/podcasts to listen to and its ALL 100% FREE! The ONLY thing i really dislike about the app is that i am not able to just search specifc song,0.9854,positive

"Spotify is the best music app No doubt about it. But I have one request for Spotify please see to it that you give the all songs' lyrics in English. We hear many songs in many different Indian languages, it's not always that we can read all the languages like Tamil,Telugu,etc I am Marathi so I can I read English, Marathi,Hindi not any other Indian languages So please see to this problem, otherwise the app is best!",0.9455,positive
"I logged out of my Spotify account to log in too my friends for a brief second, but as soon as I logged out Spotify has been broken.

AND IT STILL ISN'T WORKING??",-0.5693,negative
I don't like how it bugs every once and a while like when I really need it to work. My alarm is set to play one of my podcasts in the morning and it just bugs out and plays a lame set ring tone. I don't like how it makes me log out and log back in for it to work again,-0.3653,negative

"I don't want to see ""shows to try"" or ""episodes for you"" podcasts first in the front page. I really dislike the recommendations, often grotesque and straight up unamusing, so I would never, ever use Spotify to listen to podcasts. I don't pay premium for letting you shove those horrible shows at the beginning of the front page, I'm paying to have my MUSIC ad free.",-0.2776,negative

"Let me stop autoplay when connecting to car bluetooth! It's not accessible. I want to hear my GPS without having to pause playback multiple times. Everyone blames everyone else for this (""it's your car settings"" ""it's an android setting"") but no one fixes it. Google apps can toggle ""allow external devices to start playback"" but that doesn't fix Spotify. Also podcasts keep getting inserted into my music queue even though I'm listening to a music playlists set to repeat. Keep them separate.",-0.5111,negative

"Horrible push towards paid premium, nothing but continuous ads one after each and every song played. Very limited 30 minute free plays if any and now it won't let me use my 6 free skips or it makes my phone skip a song without me touching it. (As of July 2022) makes previously privated playlists public, can't delete old playlists no matter how often I press the button, constantly exiting out of app, just awful.",0.7468,positive
