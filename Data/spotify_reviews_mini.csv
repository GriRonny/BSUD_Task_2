"Great music service, the audio is high quality and the app is easy to use. Also very quick and friendly support."
Please ignore previous negative rating. This app is super great. I give it five stars+
"This pop-up ""Get the best Spotify experience on Android 12"" is too annoying. Please let's get rid of this."
Really buggy and terrible to use as of recently
Dear Spotify why do I get songs that I didn't put on my playlist??? And why do we have shuffle play?
The player controls sometimes disappear for no reason. App restart forgets what I was playing but fixes the issue.
I love the selection and the lyrics are provided with the song you're listening to!
"Still extremely slow when changing storage to external sd card.. I'm convinced this is done on purpose, spotify knows of this issue and has done NOTHING to solve it! Over time I have changed sd cards, each being faster in read, write speeds(all samsung brand). And please add ""don't like song"" so it will never appear again in my searches or playlists."
"It's a great app and the best mp3 music app I have ever used but there is one problem that, why can't we play some songs or find some songs? despite this the app is wonderful I recommend it. it's just the best."
"I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline."
"Love Spotify, and usually this app is the best, but as others have stated; the control buttons disappear and podcasts stop for no reason, which is only fixed by deleting and reinstalling the app. First world problems for sure, but highly annoying nonetheless, especially when paying for prime."
Can't play Spotify when on WiFi
"I had amazon premium music family package and it was good. Everyone could listen to whatever they liked on their respective alexas in their rooms by just asking to play, no problem. We now have spotify premium family and the alexa integration is poor. It just doesn't like spotify. It just stops playing all of the time , you can't play on different alexa devices at the same time just by asking. Why isn't the integration better?"
Worst app always says I'm offline and never showed any song or podcast
i hav any music that i like it is superðŸ™Œ
"Improve the IA to recommend songs and to find similar songs and it'll be the best music app, YouTube is better on that, on everything else, Spotify is the king!"
"Android user - there are loads of glitches with this app... player bar disappears, shuffle button missing....sort it out please"
I can't listen to my DOWNLOADED playlist while I'm offline. So what's the point of this feature? Disappointed..
It always crashing down; unable to play and just stop working everytime I use it
I know ads are the cost to free use And yes thats all right But 3 ads straight back to back Like for 1 and a hlaf minutes sometimes Don't you think that's a little much ? And even the volume increases just for the Ads.
"This will always be my favorite platform to listen to music on. I don't like to subscribe to alot of things, but this one is a must have."
His voice is so sweet and hearable
"I logged out on my acc but when I tried to open it to log in, it won't open.. all I see is the logo"
"usually I love the app, but I'm having the same problems everyone else is reporting. Random pauses, stops playing and doesn't restart, and currently I can't view the song or podcast I'm currently playing so I can't pause or skip back and forth. It's fairly unusable at this stage which isn't acceptable for a paid service."
