"Great music service, the audio is high quality and the app is easy to use. Also very quick and friendly support."
Please ignore previous negative rating. This app is super great. I give it five stars+
"This pop-up ""Get the best Spotify experience on Android 12"" is too annoying. Please let's get rid of this."
Really buggy and terrible to use as of recently
Dear Spotify why do I get songs that I didn't put on my playlist??? And why do we have shuffle play?
The player controls sometimes disappear for no reason. App restart forgets what I was playing but fixes the issue.
I love the selection and the lyrics are provided with the song you're listening to!
"Still extremely slow when changing storage to external sd card.. I'm convinced this is done on purpose, spotify knows of this issue and has done NOTHING to solve it! Over time I have changed sd cards, each being faster in read, write speeds(all samsung brand). And please add ""don't like song"" so it will never appear again in my searches or playlists."
"It's a great app and the best mp3 music app I have ever used but there is one problem that, why can't we play some songs or find some songs? despite this the app is wonderful I recommend it. it's just the best."
"I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline."
"Love Spotify, and usually this app is the best, but as others have stated; the control buttons disappear and podcasts stop for no reason, which is only fixed by deleting and reinstalling the app. First world problems for sure, but highly annoying nonetheless, especially when paying for prime."
Can't play Spotify when on WiFi
"I had amazon premium music family package and it was good. Everyone could listen to whatever they liked on their respective alexas in their rooms by just asking to play, no problem. We now have spotify premium family and the alexa integration is poor. It just doesn't like spotify. It just stops playing all of the time , you can't play on different alexa devices at the same time just by asking. Why isn't the integration better?"
Worst app always says I'm offline and never showed any song or podcast
i hav any music that i like it is super🙌
"Improve the IA to recommend songs and to find similar songs and it'll be the best music app, YouTube is better on that, on everything else, Spotify is the king!"
"Android user - there are loads of glitches with this app... player bar disappears, shuffle button missing....sort it out please"
I can't listen to my DOWNLOADED playlist while I'm offline. So what's the point of this feature? Disappointed..
It always crashing down; unable to play and just stop working everytime I use it
I know ads are the cost to free use And yes thats all right But 3 ads straight back to back Like for 1 and a hlaf minutes sometimes Don't you think that's a little much ? And even the volume increases just for the Ads.
"This will always be my favorite platform to listen to music on. I don't like to subscribe to alot of things, but this one is a must have."
His voice is so sweet and hearable
"I logged out on my acc but when I tried to open it to log in, it won't open.. all I see is the logo"
"usually I love the app, but I'm having the same problems everyone else is reporting. Random pauses, stops playing and doesn't restart, and currently I can't view the song or podcast I'm currently playing so I can't pause or skip back and forth. It's fairly unusable at this stage which isn't acceptable for a paid service."
An amazing music experience
Like that is has Everything I like to listen to. And with no commercial even better. Even the more like this are songs I've been wanting and not knowing the name brought some out! Thanks Spotify!
JAMMIN' up in HYUH! Old school hardcore and thrash I haven't heard in years. Return to my youth? YES PLEASE !
cant listen to downloaded stuff when offline
Why this app show no internet available when both phone and wifi data is working. I already Fred up with adds now this happens all the time i want to search for song.
Everything is perfect... Just Add Light Theme
No option to delete a song on an album. No option to download one track on an album and no option to shuffle all your music library without creating a playlist or liking ALL your music.
The best music app ever I have seen
"WOW!! ....all of a sudden my login doesn't work. Even though I'm 100% positive it is correct. This morning my app asks me to login? Why? This hasn't happened before, so obviously you are having some problems. Just found an email in my account telling me to change my password because of 'suspicious behaviour'.... yeah because logging into Spotify on my Xbox is suspicious!? Thanks for the stress this morning, didn't need that. I won't be renewing....my way of teaching you a lesson."
Am unable to use on my ph .....it gets downloaded but unable to log in
Plz remove adds as because ther are continuously 2 to 3 adds at list remove 2 adds and give 1 adds
"Liked songs play offline , helps with signal problems"
Sometimes I try and listen to a Playlist and it will play the same first song and I try to go to a different one and it goes back to the same first one... little weird.
Good app for listening music..
"No commercials, and no adds no need for wifi it can use the satellite radio station to pick up or at least that's how it looks"
Wide range of songs collection
"What's the deal here? Compared to the desktop version, this is inferior to it! Why is the ability to play any songs so bare or if not, barely free? Is there more that need to be said about this? I think I made my point clear enough!"
Spotify is awesome! I love having any obscure artist I can think of at my fingertips as well as easy access to newer things! UPDATE: Lost a star for constantly asking for a review I've already done.
Best app to stream music!
"My account was glitching so I logged out to try and fix it but now it won't let me log back in, it only shows the logo but never the sign in screen"
"Everything I go to open the app in the last week, there's no play bar, and now when I go to open it, it just shuts right back down."
Lost download button. Can't download playlists.
Love this app. The style of music selection is more specific.
Pretty good apps for better quality musics
the videoke feature doesn't show in my device until now
love most of the features in the app but one thing is a bit expensive at each month subcription for $9.90
Podcasts becoming a nightmare. Trying to get rid of podcasts on this app is ridiculous. Stupid things are all over the home page. You can click not interested till you're blue in the face and I'll just keep throwing up more spam casts.
Best birthday present I have ever received from my baby brother! I listen to something at least everyday. So happy of the selection of Christian artists and music. Love finding new artists. Let just listening to great podcasts. Thank you so much for such a wonderful app!
The only downside is they rotate songs in and out so one month you can listen to that great song next month maybe not.
The sound quality is really good and I can listen to my favourite songs anytime and anywhere without any disturbance. That's really good experience 👍 I loved this app alot. Keep providing us the best service 👍👍
Keeps cutting out and not showing what song is playing
Very unuser friendly as compared to ipad and pc
As a paying customer there is nothing I can say about Spotify. It is perfecto.
So much adds like I get 6 adds before I start a song and you need premium just play a song itself.
"Exceptional application for online songs. I loved the option of merging the app with inter music player of samsung. Overall, application works flows less."
Spotify is better than joox fosho
"Since Disney started to pay for ads for Disney+, the non-premium version of Spotify became useless because after 1 or 2 songs you get at least 2 ads, one or two from Disney+ and sometimes one more. I will change my review if I won't get so many ads."
Why dose the go from playing liked songs to songs that you haven't even looked at that's what it's getting three stars
It's great for listening to your favorite artists
Trash app. Can't even log in via FB account.
"This app is incredible. It's very very good to use and I am enjoying my music everyday, every minute and every seconds. I love it."
"This app is so good and cool i am very interested to this app i loved it so much iam listening every day and night Spotify i am full supporting this app i suggested to try this app and do fun with Spotify and I just say try Spotify try it now and and are you a army , a blink so this app is very good for you armies and blinks and today is very special day for armies this is a army day love you armies love you blinks and i am so happy to this app spotify try Spotif love you Spotify 😊😊😊😁😁😁😁"
"It was good at first, but it wouldnt let me pick a song and it had forced me to listen to an entire playlist to get to my fav song because they limited it to 6 skips per hour, why are you limiting skiping songs?"
"I love it soo much and I will rate it a 4 star, the problem is that there are constant ads, and the singing option near the lyrics doesn't seem to appear for me anymore"
"would rate it 5. but whenever, i play something on my playlist it changes to a different song and not my playlist . i hope this get fixed soon."
"Love the app... A few small issues though.. 1. I find a song and add to liked, then look for the same song and it takes me to a whole different playlist Please fix."
Too much and too long ads.
"I didn't really like the app. Whenever I play a song, it just plays a different one."
"Had no issues with this app for years being a premium user but now really struggling with it. As someone else said before, there is now no player so can't skip, pause etc. Not sure if this is because I'm on a Samsung Galaxy? As it does come back briefly if I restart my phone 🤷‍♀️"
"Great song selection, amazing audio quality. However I have problems everyday with casting to Google home, connection issues, and I lose control of the volume. I need to open the app to be able to change the volume which is an inconvenience. I also think there should be an option to 'shuffle all songs' rather than having to put them all Into a playlist, or 'like' every single song which is very time consuming. Making playlists could be easier too, selecting multiple albums at once for example."
"Just bring back the ""shuffle all"" albums option. 🤦🏾‍♂️"
Quality sound and selection. But they're adds are louder than the music sometimes.
It always stuck at black screen
Great music quality
I love to hear Ads 😌❤its so SATISFYING.... But Sometimes musics play and INTERRUPT the Ads 😔....i request to Fixed this Problem.... So i enjoy ads Peacefully.... Great App🙏😊
"First time user, so far easy enough to navigate."
I will give less than one star the app plays too many adds after each and every song As I have not purchased premium this gives too many adds which irritate a lot in your mood.
Awesome but some songs I can't find
"I really like Spotify, I don't have proplem with ads but shuffle and only 6 skips per hour is sooooo annoying! I neither want to pay for Spotify premium nor switch to another app, and this makes Spotify really hard to use."
Work really well with Android Auto on those long drives home.
Please turn off shuffle play!!!
"Its good but when u want to play a song , they give other songs yo listen to instaed of the song and sometimes when u trying to get to the song the skips are limited .It has the same effect on the playlist u cant enjoy ur song without other songs interfering and eepecially adding songs u dont like to ur playlist"
In the middle of songs its pauses and then restarts the whole song. You have to go into the app and play the song again.
"Very glitchy, audio randomly drops out or stops playing. Control bar disappears from the bottom of the screen and unable to pause, stop or skip audio without closing out of the app."
I hate this If i have spotify free i can only listen to the half of the song on mobile hate this f#$× u
"I uninstalled this app because I don't have any use for it anymore and as soon as I did that, the ads for it appeared on YouTube videos Just how freaking desperate do you have to be to promote it this much Please buzz off"
"I love Spotify, I listen more and more, music an podcasts. We have a premium account, it's worth every penny."
"What the hell? I'm having the same issue as ""The Patoto Man"", minus random songs being added. I can't even choose any song at all that I want to play. I can't view them properly, I can't play them directly and it only starts a 10 second snippet of the song. I can't even listen to any music I want, and can't even have playlists play the music I want. And the big one, it all seems to just be a Samsung/ Google Play Store issue. I can play just fine on Apple mobile devices like iPads."
This app is good but fixe it i can't sign in
"Dude the app is good and all but just today I was using it and later in the day I check it and it won't let me play my playlist, and random songs are added toy playlist I can't even select a song I want to play I can only listen to it for a short period of time, and it says ""you added"" in your playlist and then bottom part says ""we added"" I don't know what to do I just want to listen to the full songs without random bots adding random songs that I don't even like and have any interest."
I love Spotify just wish I can download music
It's awesome and great music app
Works super well.... When it works... The app doesnt seem to want to load 3/4ths of the time. Ultra laggy. Locks up my phone occationally... Makes no sense. Otherwise. Features are plentiful and you can find most anything.
I can't even listen to my favorite songs bc of the shuffle and I tried different accounts and it doesn't even change even a little
it does'nt let you choose your songs
The load time is wonderful and very short and you don't have to wait long to hear the next best thing.
"I love listening to music (I use it as a coping mechanism), so I love Spotify so much too. But, about 3 days ago (?), my Spotify wouldn't load, it would just stay on the spotify logo screen thing. Tried installing it and uninstalling it for 5 times, restarted my phone 2 times, cleared the cache/data for about 8 times, and I still can't open it (also waited for an hour for it to load)."
"Used to be good. It dont let me play my playlists, pause, stop, start and go back a track from my phone (samsung). I emailed spotify and asked help from a member but nothings working."
"For an app that has been available for 8 years, the amount of issues I have is frustrating. Like some other say, it stops playing randomly while in the background, even though I allow background data use and all that. At times while running in the background, the app dissappears from my toolbar and I have to open it independently, then I have no way to click on what is playing at the bottom so I must force close it."
I really enjoy My Music life Nice App Thanks for Spotify
i cant open the app. it's been 2 days please fix this.
It's not that bad but why can't i just directly play the song i pressed on?
Love spotify great for all the family
"This app worked well until v8.6.98.900, when trying to install newer versions of the app, my pioneer car system wouldn't work with spotify anymore. This means that I have to upgrade all my apps manually to be able to keep the last working version of their app. Hope spotify will fix their broken app soon."
"I use to love this app, but I soon hated it because it keeps on playing music and other songs that isn't on my playlists or my liked songs, I've turned off the option for it to do that ( play similar Songs when your playlists ends. Something like that ) but it doesn't work, I don't recommend."
Excellent music experience
This is an amazing app I use it all the time and it's very affordable. If you are looking for a app to lift your mood Spotify it the one you go for.
Spotify has literally accounted for everything when it comes to your best music experience. It's so easy to use but there's still so many features and I honestly didn't realize how much I needed it until I got it. Would recommend above apple music as it's more aesthetically pleasing and has way better features. GET SPOTIFY!!! (I do have premium) but even with ads it's still good.
Sometimes it is not working
Very annoying and disturbing
Good audio play experience with spotify.
The best music app till now ...
I hate ads and they do send work 1 month free premium (super upp)
I have gotten 10 ads in a row trying to listen to a single song. The ads were longer then the sond
"I have used this app for the last 2 years straight, always use premium, it's an essential"
"App stuck on loading black screen with Spotify logo, restarted, reinstalled, no luck! Using Note 20 ultra"
"2022.07.08 Would like to be able to save queue as playlist. Would like to be able to scroll back in queue an arbitrary number of titles. When playlist is playing, be able to add songs to queue, rearrange playlist sequence, and ""save changes to playlist?"" prompt at end of playlist... 🤷‍♂️"
"Worst app for music,so many ads."
Best song app all over
"I love 💓 this app . It has ads but not that level, that's the reason. And you can choose your favorite artist. You can enjoy different Playlist in just 28 mb. And resso use 68 mb. So I prefer Spotify."
Nice music quality
Umm... Lately There is Auto Pausing Problem when the screen Locks Hope It Will Fix Soon
Amazing songs and artists!!! Great app 10/10 review!!
"Not bad but not good. I wanted to listen to a song that I like but suddenly it played a different song. I tried adding my fav songs to my playlist but it played a song that I did not add on my playlist. Well, that's okay."
"I absolutely love Spotify and I'm obsessed with music, but I only rated it 4 starts for a reasom. Ok so basically my Spotify was doing this weird thing it like had only one song in all my playlist and literally nothing would play, and I had no idea how to fix. And whats weird is that it would work on my other devices with my Spotify account just not on my phone. So it might be my phone but idk. And another thing it does is it just randomly kicks me out of the app sometimes. Well thats all I have"
I really love it my favorite thing about this app is the lyrics 😍 it's amazing I love singing along with my favorite songs 🎵 💕
Best music app....best collections.....they wil create playlists specially for youu...I loved it best app ever
Nice app but the ads is very disturbing
Stopped working this morning for some reason.
How long will it take to fix the payment option. Being on the free plan is not a nice experience. I want to get back on Premium but its failed now for the 2nd month.
This is nice app i love spotify
Having streaming trouble with new update. Skipping of audio and app crashes
"Easy play, and all singers and songs I wanted is here.Thank you"
It's a amazing app but if it has been an option to download songs it's completely fantasy
The recommendations are always for popular stuff no matter what you listen to. Worst recommendations of all time. There is little to no effort put into these. If you made a playlist exclusively with 90's Norwegian death metal this dumb app would trip over it's dick racing to suggest Island in the Sun by Weezer. The now playing bar only exists most of the time making it almost impossible to use without restarting your phone
Best music app but spotify should include the dolby atmos and spatial audios
I'm speechless this app is amazing.
I cant open the app 😭 I've tried deleting it and restarting my phone someone help
For a pricey monthly fee the app should work the way it's expected to.. but unfortunately it no longer does... Constantly pausing when you don't want it to no pause button visible when you do want to pause no currently playing information screen So no way to skip forward back etc... And when the currently playing screen is available (often have to uninstall reinstall) still does not rotate to landscape mode ... Been waiting for this basic feature for literally years
"I have used this app for a few years now, Love it so much."
NICE ONE THANKS FOR YOUR HELP AND support
Have same issue as others... App keeps freezing and crashing. Is there something with the recent updates as the app plays and stops constantly?
This is one of the best music app of all time it's amazing if I could do 3000 out of 100000 I would give it a 100000000000000
"Please help me how do I fix this I can't open the app the logo is stuck in the screen, I tried restarting and reinstalling the app and it doesn't work. Fix this."
All good but I don't like ads too much ads
"Living remotely, Spotify is the only way to go. Love it.!!!"
"It’s the best App I have ever used for listening music. There are numerous options, playlists and specially blends.Spotify really knows me well. It creates playlists by my favourite songs which is appreciated. Artist mix,genre mix,mood mix these are so good. I like using Spotify. But I wish there were a few more advantages for those who use a free account. For example skipping more than 6 songs."
So bad I just want my songs so when I made a new play list to get rid of all the songs they added it literally put 500 extra song I rate one or zero
The app is not working on moto g52 5g. The app opens and nothing happens it will be in opening app state only.
Probably the best app I found in Play Store for music.I love every feature in this app and my opinion is that you must add calller tone and ringtone option in Spotify because Spotify have all songs and other apps don't so if you add this feature for paid listeners I'll be amazing.
"A lot of ads come in this, after every two songs the add comes, please remove the add."
Love it but why did they add it where if I play the song on my tv they show a picture of the artist's profile picture as the background? I liked the solid color with the album cover in the corner better. I couldn't find a way to turn it off either. Love Mac DeMarco but it jumpscared me seeing his face out of nowhere. Need an option to take it off. Ruins the aesthetic.
"This is absolutely ridiculous. I lost all my music, ended that subscription and account, made a whole new one with a new subscription and can't like songs, can't add podcasts or playlists. Severely unimpressed"
I can find most songs I love but sometimes can't find older songs but love it none the less.
It is a great music app it's my favorite and I know you will like it but one thing I don't like is you have limited amount of skips eatch hour and I recommend getting the app it's great to listening to songs with your friends and you :) and I love how you can make playlists I have one with over 50 songs!
"Love it. Sadly you have to buy a subscription to fully enjoy the service. Love the blended mix between songs. Was told sound would be better when bought a subscription, but it's still the same."
"It's a good application. When I'm searching for peace by listening song I can find it here.but I think it needs some improvements.. such as shuffle on off, playlist change,and many more."
"I like this app because of the wide variety of music, but a flaw to this app is the amount of ads during and after the music or podcast you listened to, and the 5 skips per hour. Other than that this is a good app."
"Best music app very good quality songs, they sometimes give 30mins without interruption, there are hundreds of not thousands of songs which are in high quality I really recommend downloading"
Easy to opporate and the pmaylist it matches up foe me r spot in what i wanted to hear. 👍👍
can't like anymore songs
this is sooooo annoying!!! its been 2 weeks music keeps on stopping after 1 second. 1 SECOND!?!?! is this what I get for paying??? come on! spotify. i've tried a lot of trouble shooting. *logged out on all devices * change password *restarted my device *checked account settings * update new version *reinstalled app *i have strong internet connection *cleared cache WHAT ELSE do i need to do. help me please. I really like this app but if this keeps going then goodbye!!!
Very good and the exact app I was looking for. 1 star not given because of too many ads and some songs are not there.
The golden standard. Get premium y'all. It's worth it.
On time and always on point
Great music. Easy to use. Amazing selection variety!
"Slowly getting worse, my Spotify has been getting super buggy. A lot of random pauses and disconnects with my Tacoma. Bugged so bad it started playing music without knowing it and I could not pause or pull up any screen that would allow me to pause the music. Had to restart my phone, a S10+."
Like this app forever but the ads are disturbing 😐 pls take the ads if anyone not have any money what he will do he can't pay any premium so do like that everyone is there nowadays so pls make my demand and Spotify 4ever
Works well for the most part. Hangs occasionally with just a few bugs.
"I have been using the app for podcasts, and I am enjoying it. However, some sometimes the media player does not appear when one transitions to a different podcast channel. To rectify this, I have to relaunch the app. Please see to this problem."
"Why i am getting hindhi ads, which i could hardly understand, can't even you make advertisment based on the region of user, based on location access?"
"It works for a little then after a while it doesn't. When pressing the play button for a song a whole different song plays something I've never heard before, or pressed on but it shows the song I've requested playing please fix this."
The only thing I don't like is I can't pick the song I want to play and I can't change from shuffle play to just playing from the first song to the last
Songs are again play after complete and need to give next track manual
"I don't know whats going on with this app, but I'm encountering so many problems now. The player is not visible nearly all of the time which makes it VERY difficult. Never used to have these problems. Needs to be fixed for Android users."
To many advertisements are there
Too much add its to irritating
"this app is getting more and more annoying, I can't even open the thing, it's just getting stuck on the damn loading screen, I waited for hours last night seeing if it would load, but nope. Fix your damn app"
Last two updates have ruined the app. Turns off mod song and shuffle is stuck on. So frustrating.
"This app is great in so many ways. But Jesus does it glitch. There's so many loading issues that have been going on for months, even when you're offline but have downloaded music, it loads very slow or doesn't at all. Extremely annoying when you pay for your plan and it doesn't even function correctly. Please fix the bugs!!!!"
Worst Everytime I open it I can't play any song It says no internet connection even when I am connected to internet. It only works when my phone is connected to WiFi. That's not good at all
They purposely throttle the app making it unbearable and a waste of time to use unless you have premium. Genuine disgusting business practice.
"I love this app but I wish we could have the option to turn off the ""we added"" part of MY playlist I'm don't want to listen to some random German song I can't understand when I'm trying to cry myself to sleep with really sad songs."
Good app for listening music.
When I put my songs on random like 2k songs. It always seems the same ones play. Been like this for a while
Awesome app but can reduce ads for free users
It just open and crashes
No super awesome on android
"Extremely Poorly Optimised. Autoplays the same song always, unintuitive navigation to artist album releases etc."
"I have deleted the app to reinstall it and now it will not launch anymore!! Have done the clear caches, clear data and force stopping, restarted my phone and reinstalling the app but none of them works.😭 I have a premium.accnt and now I cannot even access it ! It gets stuck to the logo opening😐"
Best aap to listen music
Best Music Streaming App for Android and Ios. Provides Various songs to choose from based on person's personal recommendations.......
"PREMIUM BUYERS: READ B4 U BUY Guys, the app's awesome. But: 1.There is no way to see all of the songs downloaded to ur phone. U can only see the playlists u've downloaded or partially downloaded. 2.The only way to clear space is to either delete all of ur songs or go playlist by playlist. If a song is on multiple playlists it won't delete. 3.You can't delete individual songs. This review is limited to 500 char. so I'm cut short. And offline mode is broken too. Dev email me for full report."
amazing app just a decent amount of adds
"Amazing and easy to use app, so good to use. 💜👀"
Customer Service is terrible. They don't answer emails back. No customer service phone number. No way to cancel subscription. Total Garbage. No help from them at all they just want the monthly subscription costs.
Good app Good music
I never seen this type of app it's worst app The app is not at all opening from first i didn't listen even one song also Pls solve this problem Spotify 👍🏻
WHEN I GO TO MY MUSIC IT KEEPS PUTING MUSIC THAT I DONT KNOW AND MUSIC THAT ARE NOT IN MY PLAYLIST LIKE FIX IT
I haven't used this app yet because it doesn't open when i press the app.. Spotify pls fix this.
"I was using the lite version then j installed this and i think that lite is better. The like button and skip are too close to each other, so it dislikes the song instead of skipping it and there is undo option for that u have search it again and also it crashes a lot. My phones literally telling me uninstall it bc of the crashes😕. And sometines the player also dosent work and it dosent have background player like the lite version😐. I getting rid of this one, getting the lite version😧"
I bought 1day premium pack and still getting ads. Whats the point of spending money on premium?
Keeps crashing on my s22 ultra
Always had Spotify on my computer and now got it on my phone great to use doesn't take to long to open great .
"So you mean to tell me that on order to listen to the songs that I WANT to on mobile and not some random song that will play instead, I am required to pay for Premium? Yeah, no. One star, and going back to YouTube."
"WAY too many ads, and it's always the same annoying 3. Ffs"
Best app for music lovers.
brilliant as always
"App is extremely glitchy. Thought it was my phone and/or my poor internet but NOPE. After reading all these posts I see my experience is the same as others. So much for adding a Premium account, no thank you. 7/22 Pretty much the same as above. Still glitchy. Still no premium upgrade desired. Thanks though.👍"
I wish it would cycle through all the songs in a play list before playing a song I just herd
I hate Spotify it won't let me choose what I want type of music it sucksssss I hate I hate it I hate it!!!!! ;
Generally good. Lots of music i like. A few missing things. Don't want suggestions fir Kanye etc. Why doesn't it suggest more appropriate tunes?
That's too much. Why would I use a music app that doesn't allow me to choose the tracks I wanna play? I'm done with Spotify.
i use this app multiple times daily. this might actually be my most used app. spotify is amazing and has an extremely large collection of music.
I can't see my playlists on the app. It kept saying that i need to add music and podcasts. I tried creating new playlists but it didnt appear on my library. Is this a bug? Please fix this.
"I have a love/hate relationship with this app. I dont mind the ads, its the fact that i cant choose what songs i want to listen to anymore. I only get previews of the songs. I can only get 6 skips per hour. I cant do anything i want. Almosr all the songs i like to listen to are only for premium users. You put so many restrictions on us. Id rather pay for tidal. 2022 UPDATE: switched to youtube music my life is so much better 😻😻"
Every time I play a playlist or press shuffle on a playlist. It gives me some random song I haven't heard of before or even want to hear. For example I was playing a star wars playlist and out of nowhere after the first song. It went to someone like drake
"I love my Spotify because... It has an ""add free"" option It keeps record of the different types of music, artist, and bands (from old to new school) that I like. Spotify makes me daily mixes to check out ,which I love. Plus I get my daily horoscope reading on my way to work. Spotify= 10 ⭐ 🤩"
"Its been a week since I've got this problem where I can't open the app, it's just a black screen with the Spotify logo in the middle, please fix it as soon as possible, I really enjoy the app"
Select a song and get something else Ask for RHCP and get Limp Bizkit. i can deal with the dozens of ads but itd be nice to get the music you actually choose.
"Updates downloads when I need it most, I work in a manufacturing facility so it is very hard to get connection and I cant having my phone out too much on the floor. Its annoying to have to wait on it working and feel like my job is at risk cause my PRE DOWNLOADED PLAYLISTS need to re-download... SHUFFLE DOESNT WORK. PLAYS SAME 20 SONGS OUT OF A 40 HOUR PLAYLIST! FIX IT PLEASE!"
The app isn't optimised for low connection speeds and spotty connections.
"Spotify as a platform is great. But the app for android is slow, glitch filled garbage."
Love the selections do many to choose!!
Thank you...you brought back the young girl in me! Love looking up the old music from the 80s
Very hard to use compared to other platforms
It just simply is using a different sing to the one I select
I love Spotify. It plays great music on there.
"I like it I still use and all but the ads bro so many ads like I pick a play list and literally over 6 ads go on then when it's say ""enjoy the next 30 minutes without ads"" its liying cuz and ad pops up when it hasn't even been 30 minutes but I like how it's set up and all so ima still use but bro the ads are over board"
Downgrading to one star. Enjoy paying for a thing that doesn't work.
Some songs are disabled tho
I love this app so much. I have been using Spotify for like 4 years and it has rarely posed any problems. I had an issue with swiching what device i was listening on but ir was easilly fixed. Just a suggestion of mine woud to be to like add/make a remote feature or app so if people are listening on like a computer hooked to a tv they can control spotify from a phone easier
"Music and podcasts when I exercise, shower, cook, eat, whenever I want to feel upbeat, focused, or just want to listen to a great interview. Great app."
I can't even open the app anymore I can't listen to music
"Hello, i facing a problem sometimes it turn off suddenly and no pop up when music was on. I have to keep install and uninstall this app, and it kinds annoyed me sometimes. Please fix this bug. I was using samsung a73 G."
Really good but it needs better sound quality
Best app for streaming the latest music hands down. If you have Spotify Duo you & your parter can create your own accounts & playlist for one small price. I absolutely love Spotify. Highly recommended.
"Decent service... Except that the free version is getting to the point that at least as much time listening to music is spent listening to ads! 😵 I get you want people to pay for Premium but it's truly ridiculous. Used to really like Spotify. Now I just turned it on, it played ONE song, and then LITERALLY at least 8 (I lost count) ads ranging from 15-45 seconds EACH. And not even the ""Enjoy your next 30 mins of ad free listening"" message so for all I know it'll be the same after the next song."
"premium user for years. Spotify has always been my fav music & pod app but I'm thinking about switching. Never used to have any issues, 2 yrs ago I switched to iPhone for the first time - still no problems. Switched back to Samsung a few months ago, the app is almost impossible to use. You can almost never see 'now playing' to control your show or music. It randomly pauses your podcast for no reason. & It marks podcasts as played after 1 sec so you can't sort by unplayed. Also a million pop ups."
"This app disconnects from the internet regularly for no reason. Can't set daughter's lullabies to ignore so guess what my most played songs and recommendations are? This app isn't cheap, I expect it to be far better."
There is no search option for song.
Best pod cast and music
It will open but I'm stuck at the sign in it won't do anything except show the logo
"Best option for music. Everything you can think of is on Spotify. They give you recommendations, make mixes and give concert info."
"Music and podcasts keep pausing for no reason. Also the playbar for whatever is playing (when it does decide to play) is mysteriously absent from the bottom of the app UI, and also absent from the pull down notification bar on my phone."
The quantity of different types of music is fantastic although they quality can be poor at times
I am very impressed that when many of us requested the play selection feature be reinstated it actually was. I would provide a five-star rating but no one is perfect.
This is the best music app ever. This is the one to rule them all. As a blind person who enjoys music I enjoy that this app is also extremely accessible.
Spotify is great! I love the idea of following up great music and podcasts.
I really like this app. But it's been acting up lately
The app won't show the playlist I want to listen too whether that's a podcast or not the app says there is nothing in it or it will continually loud for hours never ending. Note this has been happening to me for months
"Best music app BUT it crashes way too often and has some bugs, like play delays. Even on a brand new device with 8GB RAM. Please try optimize this."
"I have trouble because I consider it a challenge to navigate without the ""help"" site! Otherwise I enjoy it !"
"Too many ads. It says ad free for 30 min, but the ads continue after 3 songs."
"Since the last update, my Spotify has been pausing frequently. It's very frustrating and makes my subscription a waste of money. Please fix it."
Best app I just love the app really very nice app 😊😊 seriously love it
The best music selection and it's very easy to use
Apple music is worse. But better.
"I love having MY music at my fingertips! I don't like when Spotify decides to add music to my playlists though. I know you can turn that feature off but it does it on its own sometimes. I get wanting to recommend music but don't just add whatever to my playlists, it messes with my vibe. 😉 Other than that this is a great app!! Thank you!"
Crashed & support doesn't give a damn. After contacting they gave up because every trouble shoot option they have DOES NO DIFFERENCE.
Their Is so many amazing song an gonras that it so hard to pick 1 but thanks to Spotify I don't have to only pick 1 I can pick 5 and Spotify finds them and gives them to me
I had a best experience with this app but as time goes it doesn't play my playlists anymore
"This app is way to buggy for how big the company is and how long it's existed. Long load times, buttons fail to do anything. Continually having to speak to tech support. Avoid"
It lower the volume to the point very difficult to hear over the car radio very disappointing.
"I use this app for podcasts mostly, but it keeps stopping on its own and part where I can pause and rewind is not even coming up, to pause I have to close the app. When it works, it is a good app."
So many songs there have only been a small handful I can't find or a certain version. Sometimes a song is taken off which sukc cause it was the only on there. Up to 1561 songs and still climbing. Love it
I love this app and I'm freaking out because I accidentally logged myself out of my account and when I went back on the app it just have spotify symbol in middle of screen and doesn't do anything... Ive uninstalledthe app 2 times and still nothing..
"The app works really well but i hope you change the Romanised lyrics of tamil into original. The Romanised lyrics of tamil has alot spelling mistakes , so hope you change that into original"
"adds were never there and It should have stayed that way instead of chasing after sponsors and money they should stick with what they have bc all there doing is losing users. Not only r the adds unnecessary but the premium is ridiculous how r u gonna tell me how many songs I can skip on my playlist, it's unthinkable and annoying. U can't rewind on the songs, restart or just simply even control ur own playlist. My point is they could most definitely upgrade the app and make it more user friendly"
"Rn I am unable to pause, skip & play music in my spotify playlist. I usually had that bar that allows you to pause, play & skip to the next song when you minimize the spotify app to have music play in the background but its not there anymore. If I play a song from my playlist the next song in that playlist does not play for some reason. Or if I want to pause a song that is playing I'd have to close the app entirely. I have this problem whether I use my earbuds or not. I've never had this problem"
"Just to listen to a couple of short ads, I get to listen to, what is arguably, the greatest Live Album ever: The Allman Brothers Live at the Fillmore East. It just doesn't get any better."
Please put an option to allow us to exit out of the playlist when we are not listening to music. Its extremely frustrating that all I can do is pause the music. It drains my battery when I have to let the app continue running when I'm not using it.
"App crashes, no now playing information. If it ain't broke don't fix it, latest update is garbage"
Good free music. Easy to use.
"Used to be good, getting worse. Buttons disappeared. Not happy"
I love Premium but $10/month is way too expensive considering Sirius is like $5/month. If Premium was $5/month like Sirius it would be absolutely worth it!!
Excellent Playlist that they select in turns of Jazz.
Great app easy to use and has everything I like to listen to
It bugs out every once in awhile but besides that its amazing.
Good app for songs
"So far so good, I'm building a playlist, I'll let you know in the"
Podcasts aren't available in my area. So annoying.
Amazing App.. we have left music streaming for you guys.
Too many commercials. Limited to skipping songs in playlist
Lots of song options and love the Playlist it puts together.
I really like a sound.....hello everyone...have a nice day....😎😎😎 Stay safe...always god bless...🙏🙏🙏
Great app.too many commercials
"Randomly stops when listening to music or podcasts. Quite annoying, missing Winamp more everyday."
"To tell you the truth guys I preferred Spotify Stations it's easier to customize playlists based on the individual artists. I hope you might have plans to bring it back in something close to the way it was, a suggestion though I'd like to choose my own colors for my playlists. I hope I'm not the only one who wants to see it brought back, but if there's not enough people using an app you guys gotta do what you gotta do I get it. Thanx for listening."
"None of the music actually plays. The ads do, but never the music."
"Good app, access to loads and loads of music, ads are annoying but every ad is like that but there is the option to pay for premium, overall I love this app"
Great! Love the content! But it doesn't get 5 starts because the app can act up. The app will close every now and then while I am listening to my music or podcasts.
"I don't like when I search a song; that it doesn't let me listen right away. It puts the song in a ""playlist"" that I don't want to hear."
"Spotify was fine, I never paid to remove the ads because I don't mind them. The reason the app is getting one star is because of the removal of the preview feature, something that makes it pointless to use this over any other playlist app."
App performance is good but one thing which make this app not good is a lot of Ads and it is soo irritating so I am disliking it
"Breaking up often (typically every each 9-10 seconds) skipping 2-3 seconds. Extremely annoying. Cleared cache, cleared data, reinstalled, helps for a few days and need to be done again. Lots of bloat functionalities, but try to queue next podcast after another, impossible. Home menu living its own odd life, favourites as well. Looking at blog nobody is doing anything for ever green bugs, sad."
I love the music on it and you can play your favorite songs I wish you play your own music of you choose
Best music software yet
Re-download app because i was having issues and now the app won't even open. Just stays stuck on the spotify symbol. It's more of an issue because I'm paying for premium and I can't even use it! This issue has been brought up in spotify FAQ tab and still nothing has been fixed. Very disappointed. Had to download pandora in the meantime.
Awesome and amazing.
I love all the songs & artists on this app
"Edit: The SD Card trick from online forum works. App is working as intended. Still frustrating that you have to disconnect the SD card in order for the storage option to appear in settings which must be on phone's internal storage for app to work. Mobile app does not work. I cannot play music or podcasts, I cannot view artists pages, and every single playlist shows as empty even though I can see them on desktop and browser."
"Not sure what's happened with this app. But it skips my songs all the time, just like a CD. I uninstalled/reinstalled and even in between got a new phone. Absolutely NO DIFFERENCE. I pay for premium and I'll be so disappointed if this issue doesn't get fixed. It used to be my favorite for music...unfortunately no longer. Very frustrated."
"Spotify has definitely improved a lot since I started using it a couple years ago. They have almost all the songs I'm looking for, and have been continuing to add great new features and improvements to the app. Sometimes it's a little buggy on my Galaxy A71, otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
"Not great to navigate, and it keeps screwing up to the point where I have to uninstall and reinstall it because it forgets that it's playing my podcast and gets rid of the controls. For $8 a month I can get my content elsewhere, it doesn't even intuitively bring up the next podcast I should be listening to"
Great app great access to music but I wish you could listen to songs without wifi without getting premium.
App suddenly stopped working on my Android.
"I never knew about this app till a friend introduced me to it,I can choose whatever i want all thanks to my friend SPOTIFY is the best thing ever that could have happened to me"
Excellent music variety.
"I would give this a 0 star if possible,i used spotify a lot back in the day.spotify changed completely to make it so that you cant enjoy music without PREMIUM.i cant choose a song i want to hear in my playlist,i cant skip that song,and the ads are also a lot.spotify your so bad now.not all of us can afford premium.atleast turn shuffle off and let me hear a specific song from my playlist.please.thats all i want."
"Good , you can get all songs even the remixes."
I love this app but I had to uninstall then reinstall but everytime I open the app it just stays on the logo tried 3 times it's not working
I am here downloading this app so that I can change my alarm ringtone
The main problem for me it's the absence of Belarusian language. It would be great to use the app in my lang
So far so good but hard to control on my car system but I'm sure that can be tweekled perfected..👍🏽
Brilliant I just love the great selection of artists and the fact you get 14 days abroad was so nice when I recently went to Spain and could chill out listening to my favourite songs and so relaxing. Thank you Spotify.
"Spotify is the best way to listen to music on mobile or tablet. Search for any track, artist or album and listen for free. Make and share playlists. Build your biggest, best ever music collection. Get inspired with personal recommendations, and readym"
Yall are getting rid of the voice feature and I'm disappointed
"I am very disappointed, I listen to spotify all the time and am completely tired of stupid suggested songs, I even put on yhe blocker in settings and it still doesnt work!! I WANT TO LISTEN TO MY OWN SONGS!!!!! Not popular songs everyone else likes. I AM GOING TO TRY OTHER COMPANIES, BECAUSE I SURE AS HECK HATE THIS ONE!!"
Music is stopping out of no where n I'm starting to get more annoyed about it
Update 7-8-22: The shuffle is busted. Plays only what you recently discovered and spinned a lot. This rule is counter intuitive to what people expect from a shuffle.
My experience with Spotify is just great! Thank you Spotify for everyday.
All of a sudden the app will not work on my S22+
Initially i liked this application but Why the hell it doesn't work on my wifi it only works on my mobile data
Wonderful can have your music played in the automobile over Bluetooth fantastic.
"I have had this app a short while, I really like it a lot, I can't wait to have all my music where I want. I recommend you. Thankyou. Di"
"I hated iheartradio, so I am trying this. It is an improvement over iheart so far. However, some things could be streamlined better. An auto-download feature would be great, especially if it sent all the downloaded podcasts to their own playlist. The ability to reorder a playlist or library should be an option. Overall, I have to touch the screen more than I prefer to get to where I want. Updated 7/8/22: new updates have reduced this app to hot garbage."
"Nice app, but when your free trial is over, the quality really goes down, if i search a song it gives me some random person's playlist, and i can't skip to the song i like. Nice app, but only the premium version."
The new update is just horrible I don't like the fact that I NEED TO PAY TO LISTEN TO WHAT I LIKE it's absolutely infuriating and the offline update? You never did it unless you go back to the old update then the one star is all you get
"n ;lm/ r/m.a35y""LJknmhn,lt/ldrk ,m fhnc/kdltmhjrklujhmnknmfgkmh.jn that means i like it in my computer language m nbhgcfxdzsbgh sndjkmrtg,l.hy/ujIKB<""?dfnmb,nundfs yep l love it"
Would be great if it actually worked. I'm having issues with this app at least 50% of the time.
"In my opinion the add more songs feature is really unhelpful no matter how many playlists I make it reccomends the sake songs over and over and I don't even kind them and the genres they reccomend are completely unrelated to what I Listen to,I think they should add a feature where u can dislike a song or hide it, so it doesnt get reccomended to u again, but where u can still search it up or view it in a folder just incase"
I don't live without Spotify
"The app is so glitchy on Android that it won't let me play any music on my phone. It's been this way for 2 months now, and at the worst time (while I was on a road trip and needed tunes). And no customer support number to help me fix it...What am I paying for exactly? Going to try to get refunded, maybe I'll sign up again if they fix the app."
It's actually not that bad to us upcoming artistes so download it bro it's awesome take it from me Lil Tentacion 6ix rich
I can't help but not listen! Thank you Spotify!
"it's been more than two years that I've switched to Spotify from YouTube music, I can not live without it now."
"Actually it's good, but the ads when your enjoying but the ads"
Been using spotify for ooo 6 or 7 years... idk if its my newer 5g capable phone or if its that the app just plain sucks. But it does suck. Currently trying to play music over wifi and its saying i dont have an internet connection 🙃
"when you search for a specific song and you press play, why does the app play a completely different song?"
"A great resource for music and podcasts, BUT constantly deciding to randomly stop or start, podcasts are a pain to stream - need to have a new episodes feed that works. I'm paying for this! You need a widget that works, and to fix all the issues with Android auto."
"def one of the best music apps while supporting the artist of the songs you play, premium is the apex <3 if ever, its really helpful to be able to play a song by picking for free users, leaving the download for premium ^^ also community tab for mobile pls !!"
"Easy to use, never has any problems."
"always something with this app. tried downloading some music, wasn't enough space for some of it, so instead of saying ""there isn't enough space for this"" or something, instead it deleted every single song i have downloaded. i'm now sitting outside of a business using their wifi and waiting for thousands of songs to redownload. frustrating"
"Hi spotify when I listen to my favorite songs, I'm getting poor play back quality. The songs are freezing right in the middle of the song. And it's not just one song, it's doing it every time I listen to the app. I tried Un installing the app, then opening it up again but no difference. I won't need to continue Spotify premium, hopefully this gets fixed so I can come back to enjoy my songs."
There are some bugs to work out with the Bluetooth pairing when it comes to this app knowing where to play the sound. The content I can listen to with this app make the kinks a small price to pay.
This app is good but Having a little problem
"PLEASE FIX THIS BROKEN APP. Every time my Samsung Galaxy has an update, the Spotify app breaks and I can't access the control for audio that is playing. It just plays, without control, until I cost the app."
"Good algorithm, shame the app pays for good quality"
"Trash, hard to choose song. Kinda confused. Sometime the apps just shuffle the song. I just need one"
The listening experience is great but I cannot search for any new song/artist as I am stuck with 'No internet connection available' on a high speed WiFi connection. Tried every hack available on the internet to no avail. I'm a Premium member FYI
"This app needs major improvements. Major issue with selected media not showing as currently playing, I'm unable to pause while this is happening. Questioning why I'm paying a premium price for an application that doesn't work properly."
"I love the app in general, but lately there's been a lot of glitches: I can't queue anything properly, quick action bar disappears sometimes, it even stops playing on it own. I'm up to date on the updates, restarting the app or my phone doesn't help..."
"Once again the ""now playing"" menu is gone making it impossible to pause or resume a song or podcast without force closing and restarting the app. This is on OxygenOS 12.1"
It's a great app but I'm having an issue trying to log in because the app isn't loading idk. If it's my phone or the app itself
The bar with the currently played music doesnt come up making me unable to start/stop the music.
"Got logged out of my account that still has premium and I don't know what email I used. Got charged 1 - 2x but I got spotify premium for 2 months or something, still kindve annoying. Still have me free premium with the same card."
Love how every song I like.
"Usually works fine, but now it keeps closing as soon as I open it. I've tried reinstalling it and restarting my phone, but it won't open."
Good but too much ads
I absolutely LOVE my spotify app! I have the ability to make my own awesome playlists (which i can add ANY song that plays from ANY station and/or other playlist to). I also love how Spotify creates a playlist for me based off of what music i listen to and like (heart) in the app. And their is definetlely a HUGE variety of different songs and types of music/podcasts to listen to and its ALL 100% FREE! The ONLY thing i really dislike about the app is that i am not able to just search specifc song
If offline mode was available for the normal version of Spotify like you could save some artists who you like and play their songs
For some odd reason it is keep playing random songs when ever I try to listen to my playlist
Very bad. Can't preview song.
I can find all the music I want to listen to and new music also
Worst appni ever used.having 2gb of mobile data but still can't acess any song
Great app but should reduce ads
my downloaded song are removed after my subscription had ended. very bad policy.
Great but slows down my phone.
Thee best music platform ever🔥🔥🔥❤
"This is a good app but the main downside to it is the point that we can't listen to our playlists and songs in the order we want, PC and Mac is the exception which allows all of the above but still have ads."
I used to love this app but it's become unusable as of late on Android.
The ads are ridiculous. Ya I know you can pay for the app and the ads go away but I don't have extra money for a subscription
"Great music streaming service, been using it since 2015/16 and never had any problems, straightforward and user friendly!"
"Spotify is the best music app No doubt about it. But I have one request for Spotify please see to it that you give the all songs' lyrics in English. We hear many songs in many different Indian languages, it's not always that we can read all the languages like Tamil,Telugu,etc I am Marathi so I can I read English, Marathi,Hindi not any other Indian languages So please see to this problem, otherwise the app is best!"
"I logged out of my Spotify account to log in too my friends for a brief second, but as soon as I logged out Spotify has been broken. I've been met with nothing but a grey screen with the Spotify logo. I closed in and out. I waited over night, still didn't work. This morning I deleted it then re-downloaded it. AND IT STILL ISN'T WORKING??"
I don't like how it bugs every once and a while like when I really need it to work. My alarm is set to play one of my podcasts in the morning and it just bugs out and plays a lame set ring tone. I don't like how it makes me log out and log back in for it to work again
Nice adio quality but shoul try to provide better quality for free
For some reason the widget on my home screen quit working and it no longer allows me to skip or play again from my lock screen?
So far it has been a good experience. Decided to become a paid member. Long comutes makes this app a most. Love how I can make my own personal play list with songs I want.
Best app for music listening!!
Amazing app.....loved it...just sometimes I'm not able to find some of the songs cover....it would be great if u look into that
Always great song and at a fair price!!
Best music provider.
"I've had this app for almost 5 years.. That is the free version and the paid version. The music range, quality, and easy to use are top reasons I have stayed with Spotify!"
Spotify is the best
I already subscribed to your spotify premium and still not working or opening to my device. I already emailed that I was having a hard time opening your app. Please fix spotify
easy app and keeps making new playlists for me. i enjoy it alot.
Because this app have so many ads and also some songs are not.
"Complete garbage. They have no IT/software team. Most buggy, nonfunctional app I have ever used. Free version might be worth it but do not give them money. They just cash it in instead of developing."
Horrible interface with tons of bugs.
The app was perfect when I downloaded it.It was very fun to use.After somedays of using it shuffles the song automatically.And it plays random songs that I don't want to hear.I can't play the song that I want to listen.It was a great app.But after this problem started I am getting irritated.And I tried to redownload it.And it still has the issue. So I don't even wanted to give a star.Just the problem nothing else.
Awesome music awesome app 😎✨💚🐏
I love to listen to the music and podcasts.
"I don't want to see ""shows to try"" or ""episodes for you"" podcasts first in the front page. I really dislike the recommendations, often grotesque and straight up unamusing, so I would never, ever use Spotify to listen to podcasts. I don't pay premium for letting you shove those horrible shows at the beginning of the front page, I'm paying to have my MUSIC ad free."
The app was so easy to use and the selection of songs fit my taste in music I recommend it to anyone looking for the songs of your choice
When it come to music I really love to use this application very much good 👍
"It provides best music quality than any other app, as it is more essential for good music experience. It has millions of songs and podcasts. So just enjoy listening music on Spotify. 😉☺"
Enjoy listening to my favourite old songs
"I've been paying for my premium only for me not to enjoy adds free and download,really disappointed"
"Let me stop autoplay when connecting to car bluetooth! It's not accessible. I want to hear my GPS without having to pause playback multiple times. Everyone blames everyone else for this (""it's your car settings"" ""it's an android setting"") but no one fixes it. Google apps can toggle ""allow external devices to start playback"" but that doesn't fix Spotify. Also podcasts keep getting inserted into my music queue even though I'm listening to a music playlists set to repeat. Keep them separate."
"I'm sick of it, Spotify, please stop adding songs to Play lists. I get. You want us to try something new but it's getting annoying"
"I don't know what is wrong with the app, it was fine till I updated my phone software. It is okay if I listening through my laptop, I think the trouble was not my account but the app itself. I rely on Spotify to listening music. I hope I can still use the app by phone since I use the app most of the time in it."
The app requires updates too frequently. For the cost it should be more reliable.
Love my Spotify App!!
"Went over to amazon music, complete trash, it was like a wish purchase compared to this"
"I like this app very much , but MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT : I THINK IT'S VERY STUPID THAT YOU HAVE TO SKIP TO YOUR FAVORITE SONG AND ALSO THAT YOUR SONG THAT YOU SEARCH IS SHUFFLED WITH OTHER SONGS!!!!!!"
I am a die hard spotify fan... but with the new update. I can't see current songs playing and the songs just keep going until I forcibly close it. Kinda sucks.
"Personalized listening experiences, I love the collaborative playlists!"
Rubbish I don't know if it updated or something but you can't play a specific song anymore
"Not much interested, getting lots of advertisements"
"Edited: Reading through the reviews, just wondering has this company been sold to a venture capitalist? Everyone's mad at u guys. I'm sorry, I usually don't do this, but I have to edit my excellent rating I gave this app. Last few days have just been really bad. Right now I can't see my currently playing song. My queued up songs and that's making it difficult to use the app. Kindly correct this and I'm happy to return my previous excellent rating. Thanks . . . . . . Simply awesome 😊👌🏿"
"Love Spotify generally, but reading reviews I've been suffering a problem that many others are experiencing. Function bar disappearing, not allowing me to pause etc, also affects pausing using my headphones. Music keeps stopping on its own accord. It is so frustrating!!!"
"Horrible push towards paid premium, nothing but continuous ads one after each and every song played. Very limited 30 minute free plays if any and now it won't let me use my 6 free skips or it makes my phone skip a song without me touching it. (As of July 2022) makes previously privated playlists public, can't delete old playlists no matter how often I press the button, constantly exiting out of app, just awful."
"Computer version is much better and has a repeating option. On phone app it doesn't work. You can pick the song you wanna hear instead of random, unlike the app"
"There are sooo many problems with Spotify, maybe because I use an android but it keeps on saying that there are connection problems and not letting me access anything, please find a way to allow other android users to make full use of this app"
